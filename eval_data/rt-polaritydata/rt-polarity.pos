Additionally got [**1-12**] U FFP and 10 mg PO vitamin K.  Additionally in the setting of hypotension, the patient was given ceftriaxone. Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**], the patient felt well overall.  She had no acute complaints including no nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, dizziness, chest pain, abdominal pain or shortness of breath.  The patient  reports that over the last 3 weeks she has had an overall feeling of unwellness.   She has had decreased energy, depression and lack of appetite.  She has had significantly lower PO intake and also noted new black stools and mild dizziness.   She has had no presyncopal episodes and no loss of consciousness. ROS: The pt denied recent unintended weight loss, fevers, night sweats, chills, headaches, vertigo, changes in hearing or vision, including amaurosis fugax, neck stiffness, lymphadenopathy, hematemesis, coffee-ground emesis, dysphagia, odynophagia, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, cough, hemoptysis, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion, increasing lower extremity swelling, orthpnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, leg pain while walking, joint pain. 
83yo F with baseline dementia, Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] on Prednisone, Asp PNA, Splenectomy, hx of MVR (porcine valve), CVA, Afib, hx Endocarditis who presents with hypoxic respiratory failure. The pt's family states that one month ago, the pt saw her neurologist; at that time they requested that decreased the prednisone dose. Pt's MG has been stable for ~ 10 years on 10mg. Initially, prednisone decreased to alternating 10/5mg; then decreased to 5mg qd, which is the current dose. Per dtr, she noted pt developed non-productive cough, increased dysphagia, and increased lethargy 2 weeks ago - the grandson disagrees with this history. One day PTA, pt was noted to have increased lethargy and difficulty walking (is able to walk with assistance at baseline). Temp was noted to be 100; brought pt to ED. Family denies recent chills, pains (pt is non-communicative), cough, changes in urination (incontinent at baseline), diarrhea. . On presentation to the ED, the pt was found to have a fever to 101.4 and to be hypoxic to the 80s and rapidly deteriorated to the 70s at which point she was intubated. Started on propofol drip. Initial labs remarkable for Lactate 3.5, WBC 25. CXR with RML infiltrate. In the ED was given Ceftriaxone and clindamycin. Started on propofol drip. Given 3L NS, tylenol, decadron 10mg IV x1. 
53yo gentleman with h/o CAD (2 vessel disease of LCx and co-dominant RCA), mild systolic CHF (EF 45%), and DM2 transferred from [**Hospital3 412**] with NSTEMI. Patient reports stuttering exertional and non-exertional chest pain for anywhere from days to months, depending on the interviewer. He had dismissed the pain as being due to acid reflux. Of note, he had stopped taking many of his cardiac medications (including plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, and imdur) without discussing the matter with his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] finally came into the hospital at [**Hospital3 **] because his pain did not go away after a few days despite taking antacids. He also admits to doing 4 lines of cocaine 2 days prior to presentation. During his initial work-up at [**Hospital1 **], he was found to have ST depressions in V5 and V6 with troponin of 3.1, at which point he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. He received ASA, plavix 300mg, and lovenox and was on a nitro gtt prior to transfer. He was also on an amiodarone gtt for reported frequent ectopy. In the ED, his initial VS were: 97.2 146/85 25 95% 4L. He was having mild chest pain and frequent runs of NSVT. Cardiology was consulted for positive biomarkers. He was put on an integrillin gtt and given morphine and zofran for symptom management. He also received lasix 40mg IV x 1 because of evidence of heart failure on exam. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3961**] is a 53 year-old gentleman who underwent a CABGx3 on [**6-1**] with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 902**] at [**Hospital1 18**].  He had an uneventful post-op course and was discharged on [**Last Name (un) **]-operative day 4.  He has been followed since for a superficial sternal wound infection and peripheral edema requiring increased doses of lasix.  He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and chest pain that worsens with coughing. 
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 74 yo woman with pulmonary fibrosis and COPD on transtracheal home oxygen (3-4L) and chronic prednisone (10mg po daily) who was admitted to the MICU on [**3169-6-4**] for worsening dyspnea and hypoxia after elective bronchoscopy earlier that day.  She was admitted in [**Month (only) 946**] (~6 wks prior to this admission) to an OSH for exacerbation of her shortness of breath and was discharged to a rehab facility.  Previously, she had been the primary caretaker for her ill husband, and reports being able to perform household chores and climb the stairs in her house, though believes this "wore her out." . Because of the six weeks of worsening dyspnea and two days of increased cough productive of prurulent sputum (which coincided with an episode of prolonged epistaxis c/w prior history, though patient denies any link to her SOB), she was scheduled for elective bronchoscopy on day of admission.  Per IP notes, there was no bloody secretions in the airways, minimal clear secretions and no endobronchial lesions.  Pt was monitored post procedure without event and was transferred back to the rehab where she and her husband have been living for the last 2 months.  On return to rehab, husband was concerned that she was increasingly SOB and O2 sats dipped into the 70s.  Husband spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who recommended returning to the ED for evaluation. . In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.1 P 101 BP 141/54 R 24 O2 sat 96%. Patient underwent a CXR which was essentially unchanged with possible retrocardiac opacity.  She was given Vanc/Levofloxacin, Albuterol and Ipratropium for possible PNA. Cultures/Coags were not sent as she was a difficult stick.  Hct was notably down from recent baseline and was positive with brown stool. Pt denied any BRBPR or hematemesis and was given IV PPI.  She was cross matched for blood and GI was notified.  Pt was ultimately admitted to the ICU for tachypnea and O2 requirement. . On arrival to the ICU, pt was tachypneic but completing full sentences and not appearing to be in any distress.  There were no events and she was transferred to the floor the next day.  On the floor, she is resting comfortably on 4L, speaking full sentences, though becoming SOB with minimal exertion (such as sitting forward for lung exam) and with occasional cough.  She denies any dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, nausea, or vomiting. . Review of sytems:  She was denying CP, palpitations, PND, orthopnea, lightheadedness, tingling, numbness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or BRBPR.  She has baseline dark stools due to iron replacement and this remains unchanged.  She denies fevers, URI or congestion but reports general decline in resp status over the last 6 wks and feels SOB has gradually worsened with some increased cough with scant hemoptysis since episode of epistaxis.

85 y/o male with h/o CAD s/p 4VCABG in [**3098**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to D2 with jump graft to OM, and SVG to RCA), CHF (EF 45%), T2DM, HTN, and PVD, with multiple recent admissions for cath with stenting, last from [**Date range (1) 14444**] at which time cath revealed known occluded LIMA-LAD with non-flow limiting lesions in other grafts, and a discrete 90% stenosis of D1 that was ballooned, presenting from [**Hospital 872**] hospital with concern for STEMI. . He was recently discharged on [**6-16**], with hospital course notable, in addition to POBA of D1, for persistent CK elevation with normal MBI, thought to be myositis secondary to statin use and his statin was discontinued.  He also had an episode of AVNRT and was loaded on digoxin, however this was discontinued on discharge. . He was transferred back to [**Hospital 99**] Rehab on [**6-16**], where he was reportedly doing well until the morning of transfer, when he was noted to be hypotensive to systolic of 60s.  He was taken to [**Hospital1 872**] ED where initial vitals were T 96.4, BP 76/48, HR 80, 98% on RA.  An EKG reportedly revealed ST depressions with TWI in V2-V3.  A CXR showed CHF.  Troponin T was 0.34 which is actually decreased from 1.74 on discharge.  He was given an [**Hospital1 **] and started on a heparin drip.  Labs were notable for mildly elevated creatinine of 1.2, hct 28.9, mild leukocytosis at 11. A UA was positive and he was given unasyn as well as gentamicin due to concern for urosepsis.  He was given 1.5 liters of IVF. The heparin drip was discontinued as ischemia was felt to be less likely at that point.  However, on the morning of [**6-24**], the patient was still hypotensive, with new ST elevations in V1-V3, as well as a troponin elevation to 5.7.  He was restarted on a heparin drip and arrangments were made for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization. . Catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**] on the day of transfer revealed markedly elevated right and left sided filling pressures (PCWP 32, PA 60/28), as well as new 100% in stent stenosis of the LAD. Unfortunately the lesion was difficult to cross and the procedure was aborted after 78 minutes of fluoro time and 230 cc of contrast, with plans for possible re-catheterization the next day.  The patient was given 40 mg IV lasix in the cath lab, and another 40 mg IV lasix on arrival to the CCU, with almost 2 L urine output within 2 hours of CCU arrival. . The patient himself seemed somewhat confused. He denies any recent chest pain, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness.  He does complain of right leg pain. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 14452**] is a 36 year old male with severe biventricular cardiomyopathy, EF 10%, HIV since [**3477**] (not on HAART), depression, recent diagnosis of hepatitis presenting with 1 week of progressive dyspnea, abdominal pain/distention, PND/orthopnea, and tachycardia. He reports that his abdominal pain was persistent ever since his last admission and has been progressively worsening for the past month. Mainly located in the epigastrum and RUQ, intermittently with right shoulder pain as well. Has had nausea today only, no vomiting. He also endorses progressive weight gain since his discharge one month ago when he was 164 lbs, now reportedly 184 lbs. Has had looses, yellow stools, [**3-18**]/day for the past week. Denies any hematochezia/melena. He has had very poor sleep due to the pain and took 2 tylenol pm a night for the past [**3-18**] nights. Stopped taking his meds on Monday and Tues and felt much better, resumed meds on Wed and symptoms returned. Has been feeling dehydrated so stopped following fluid restriction and started drinking 3000-4000 ml daily. Also reports increasing abdominal pain and distention and bloating of his face. . Of note he was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 14455**] with dyspnea and fatigue and was found to have cardiomyopathy with EF 10%. He was initially admitted to the CCU and treated with lasix gtt for diuresis with improvement of symptoms. Cardiomyopathy felt most likely to be [**2-17**] toxine from crystal meth vs viral. He was newly diagnosed with HCV however seen by GI and not felt to be acute infection. He had high spiking of fevers to 103 and initially treated with vanc/gent, followed by ID however no infection ever identified and abx d/c'd and fevers attributed to viral illness. . In the ED, initial vitals were T 100.4, HR 133, 120/86, RR 24 100%?. He triggered on presentation for tachycardia and tachypnea. He had bedside ultrasound in the ED reportedly showing "IVC full, no resp variation, fluid in [**Location (un) 6731**] pouch, likely ascites. GB difficult to visualize". He was give 37.5mg metoprolol, morphine 4mg IV x2, zofran 4mg IV x2. During CT scan IV infiltrated about 15-20 cc contrast in L arm, ice applied. He was started on IVF at 25 cc/hr. . VS prior to transfer: 97.8 118/82 101 25 100%2L 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 14452**] is a 36 M with a history of HIV not on HAART, non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with EF of [**11-3**]%, and chronic transaminitis who presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion. He states that since his last hospitalization (discharged [**3492-7-5**]), he has been taking his medications as prescribed. However, while he has felt occasionally well for days at a time, every 3-4 days he has a "bad" day where he feels very ill, though the nature of symptoms on bad days has varied. On this occasion, he began feeling poorly on Saturday, when he had decreased energy and also developed non-productive cough. He is not aware of having had fever at home, and no chills. He noted worsening DOE over this time interval as well, though he is now fairly limited at baseline in terms of what he is able to tolerate in the way of activity (has had to scale back his dog-walking business). He was out with his dogs today when one ran away, and he was forced to [**Male First Name (un) **] it. When he caught up with the dog, he was nauseous and vomited x 1. He also felt extemely weak and SOB. As he had also noticed that his weight has increased by 3.5 lbs since Friday, he called Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who instructed him to come into the ED for evaluation. . In the ED, initial vitals were T 100.3, HR 129, BP 100/80, RR 18, 100% on RA . He was given mg IV furosemide given his history of heart failure. D-dimer returned positive, so CTA was done but negative for PE. Abdominal CT and CXR did not reveal acute pathology. He received morphine for pain control (atypical chest pain, abdominal pain). During his time in the ED, he was tachycardic to 100s-130s and tachypneic to 40s. He was evaluated by the cardiology fellow and started on nitro gtt before transfer to the CCU. At the time of transfer, vitals were T 97.4, HR 121, BP 95/78, RR 42, SaO2 100% 3L NC. . On arrival to the floor, he remains dyspneic and also nauseous, though says his breathing is slightly better than on presentation. He has continued chest/abdominal pain which was slightly improved by morphine in the ED. . On review of systems, he endorses chest pani (chronic/constant, "tightness" in center chest) and abdominal pain (worst in the epigastrum, associated with belching and a sensation of bloating, feels like "a knot or something hard....like after you get punched") which is brought on by palpation but not present at rest. He also reports pain in his right calf since earlier today. He has had episodes of orthopnea at home, to the point where a few nights ago he was forced to sleep in a chair because it was the only way he could feel comfortable. He reports diarrhea with up to [**6-21**] bowel movements per day, yellowish, no blood, of varying volumes. He is awakened from sleep by the diarrhea. He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors though does get occasional nightsweats. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. All of the other review of systems were negative. 
53 year old woman with hypertension, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, diasolic CHF (preserved EF), pulmunary HTN, and COPD, with recent admission for SVC syndrome during which she received catheter based tPA, who was brought to the ED from rehab after her hemodialysis catheter had fallen out. She was was brought to the angio suite where she had a right IJ hemodialysis catheter advanced into the right atrium. She subsequently complained of dyspnea, became profoundly hypoxic (O2 sat 50s), and had a respiratory code initiated. . The patient was admitted from [**6-1**] through [**6-12**] with facial swelling. She was found to have an SVC clot and received catheter based tPA overnight. The following day ([**6-5**]) she underwent thrombectomy and dilatation of the SVC. Post-thrombectomy she had good flow in her SVC. On [**6-9**] she had acute dyspnea, at which time she had a CTA which did not demonstrate any PE, and demonstrated decreased collaterals, indicative of resolution of SVC clot. It did, however, demonstrate a new right upper lobe infiltrate. She was started on ciprofloxacin and discharged to rehab to complete a 7 day course. . At rehab her dialysis catheter apparently fell out on the day of admission. She was brought to the ED, from which she went to the angio suite after getting 2 units of FFP. In the angio suite they reintroduced a hemodialysis line through the old tunneled site in the right IJ. The wire advanced with ease, as did the catheter. While suturing in the catheter after the procedure the patient acutely complained of inability to breath, after which point her O2 saturation dropped to the 50s on room air. She received nebulizer treatment several times without effect. A code blue was called. Hemodynamically she was stable throughout, with systolic BP 150-220, HR 120-140. She had a right femoral central line placed. She was difficult to bag, and after intubation her peak inspiratory pressures were noted to be in the 50s and she was therefore given bag mask ventilation until she arrived in the CCU. Post-intubation CXR demonstrates placement of the HD line relatively low, almost RV, with dense infiltrate throughout the right lung. . She was admitted to the MICU and remained intubated until [**2553-6-16**] when she was extubated. It was felt her respiratory decompensation was due to pneumonia, and her antibiotics coverage was expanded to Meropenem/Vancomycin. She also had a chest CT angiogram of the chest which showed RUL/RLL pneumonia without evidence of PE. On presentation now she is sating 100%on 2L NC. Afebrile for 24 hours and w/o complaints. . 
92F non-verbal with dementia  and NH resident who p/w several days of hypoxia, fevers, and cough.  Pt was started on levofloxacin and clindamycin for presumed aspiration PNA and klebsiella UTI at NH 2 days ago.  Pt also received lasix 20 mg po qd x 2 days for presumed CHF decompensation.  Pt was found to be hypoxic at 89% on NRB and tachypnic to 38.  Pt received lasix 40mg iv x 1 and ntg paste and was x-ferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. In [**Name (NI) **], pt was febrile to 102 and tachypnic to 30's with SaO2 of 95% on 5L NC.  Pt was also found to have lactate of 2.5 with WBC 16 and no bands.  ABG in ED showed the following: 7.46/37/78.  Pt received Levo, flagyl and Vanco prior to receiving Blood Cx.  CXR was without obvious infiltrates and KUB showed no dilated loops of bowel.  Later sensitivities from NH, showed the Klebsiella to be Resistant to levo and cipro, but Sensitive to Cefriaxone.  The patient subsequently got Cefriaxone 1 g IV x 1. Patient also placed on levophed gtt. In addition, the patient also went into afib with RVR at 170's, which was subsequently slowed down to a ventricular rate of 120s w/ IV Dilt.  Pt developed Troponin of 1.2 w/ nl CK in setting of RVR, suggesting this was most likley demand ischemia.  Pt also was found to have a sodium of 160 (hypovolemic hyperNa. Patient was then admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**]. Patient subsequently switched from levophed to vasopressin and dobutamine, with disscontuation of pressors on [**10-26**] and had improvement of oxygenation. Antibiotics therapy was changed from ceftriaxone and Zosyn to Unasyn. Culture data from [**Hospital1 18**] remains negative to date. Patient did have recurrent episode of Afib with RVR that was treated with diltiazem, while on dobutamine, with no further episodes while off B-agonists. At time of transfer, patient remains non-verbal. 
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with dementia (non-verbal) brought in from [**Hospital3 2520**] with lethargy and hypoxia (not on baseline O2) noted this morning. She reportedly sounded congested. O2 sat there was 69% RA, 79% on 5L NC, T 96.7, HR 120's, BP 129/73. On arrival in the ED VS were T 99.9 HR 85 BP 130/54 RR 26 (28-30) Sat 70->improved to high 84% on NRB. ABG showed 7.33/49/62. She was started on CPAP with improvement to 94%. After 1 hour ABG showed 7.31/45/74. She was DNR/DNI on arrival however her daughter and HCP reversed this and requested intubation if needed. She received 1L NS. Blood cultures were drawn but urine culture was not sent. She was given 1gm ceftriaxone when CXR revealed RML consolidation. She was ordered for additional 1gm vanco iv and zosyn (not clear if they were given). Labs were significant for troponin of 0.07, potassium 5.9 (on repeat 5.1), WBC 13.9, lactate 2.6. ECG showed a. flutter at rate of 111. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for further management. . At baseline per daughter she opens eyes, eats (with assistance) thick liquids and purees. She has had private nursing for the past 3 years with no infectious complications or bed sores but prior to that had frequent UTI's, aspiration PNA's and bed sores. Additionally daughter notes baseline blood pressure 'runs low.'

This is a 49-year-old gentlemen with a history of end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia who had a four to five day history of shortness of breath and chest pressure and eventually presented to an outside hospital on [**2812-1-25**].  He received hemodialysis earlier that same day and was noted to be hypotensive after Dialysis with systolic blood pressures in the 70s.  His symptoms did not resolved with rest and he presented to the Emergency Room at an outside hospital with hypotension, congestive heart failure, elevated troponin and electrocardiogram changes. He was then transferred to the [**Hospital6 253**] Emergency Room for further evaluation. Initially he was on dopamine, aspirin, Lovenox, nitroglycerin and was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.  Patient was initially restarted on BiPAP and Lasix with improved respiratory symptoms.  However, the day following, the patient experienced cardiac arrest and was coded for 40 minutes with recovery complicated by cardiogenic shock. During hospitalization he was noted to have a new murmur and was evaluated for possible endocarditis.  Patient was intubated during his cardiac arrest for cardiogenic shock and was noted to have a white blood cell count of 18.4, congestive heart failure on chest x-ray and ischemic electrocardiogram changes.  He was initially started on vancomycin and levofloxacin.  Patient was also started on CVVH for further fluid removal with concern for his hypotension.  Eventually patient had his levofloxacin changes to gentamicin and had an echocardiogram which showed severely depressed ejection fraction and severe aortic stenosis. Patient at times converted into atrial fibrillation and was shocked successfully and then had a PEA arrest and then was successfully resuscitated from that. Patient then went to the cardiac catheterization and had normal coronaries.  Valvuloplasty was attempted without success and then was repeated with some success.  Patient had noted a background of a several months history of purpuric rash.  Biopsy was consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis per Dermatology.  The patient was admitted in his early hospital was being managed for hypotension cardiogenic shock, aortic stenosis with presumed endocarditis, pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure exacerbation, end stage renal disease on hemodialysis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

He denied exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of palpitations or syncope. 
73 year old male with CAD, CHF (EF 20%), v-tach s/p ICD placement, AFib on warfarin, s/p whipple, chronic dyspnea with 2.5L NC at baseline, presenting with fever (100.2 at home), rigors, and altered mental status. Patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, with admission in [**2546-5-1**] requiring an ICU stay and ventilation. Patient relates that symptoms began yesterday with fevers, shaking chills and overall malaise.  He did have a cough prior to admission, which was not productive of sputum, but usually brought up undigested food.  Due to constipation, the patient took extra Colace and Senna yesterday, and he had [**4-5**] bowel movements.  After straining during one bowel movement, he felt short of breath and dizzy.  He denies having any chest pain yesterday, although history in the ED had noted some chest pain prior to admission.  At his baseline, the patient sometimes has dyspnea on exertion (walking around his home) and sleeps on 2 pillows at night.  He denies any leg swelling.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematochezia, melena, dysuria or hematuria. In the ED, initial vs were: 99.2 74 95/64 16 99%.  He was alert and oriented x2, pale, diaphoretic, and hypotensive to SBP 75. Of note, from recent previous OMR records, baseline BP is 105/68.  RIJ placed, with CVP 13 and MAP ~60.  After <500 cc of fluids and abx, pt with improved MS though still not oriented to time.  Vanc + levoflox given.  CXR showed bilateral opacities c/w atelectasis vs. infection.  Total IVF given ~750cc with resolving pressures to BP 91/51.  Given no meningismus, HA, or neck pain, LP was deferred. Vitals on transfer: 101.8, 75, 91/51, 17, 97% 2L NC and CVP 13. In the ICU, the patient was comfortable, oriented x3 and conversant.  He knew that he was in the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU, but not in the "nice" ICU that is in the clinical center.  He was breathing comfortably on supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula.  He was able to provide details of his history. 
This is a 77 y.o. male with CAD s/p MI in [**2965**], DM, HTN, and hyperlipidemia who awoke on the morning of [**2975-12-22**] at 3:00 am with chest pain.  He describes the onset of feeling somewhat unwell after dinner, and then at 3:00 am he was woken up by left sided crushing chest pain that started quite mild but then progressively increased in intensity.  He denies any radiation to his neck or arm.  He reports this is similar to his previous ischemic symptoms.  He denies any shortness of breath or diaphoresis.  He may have felts slightly light-headed but has difficulty fully clarifying this.  This pain did awaken him from sleep and did not change on exertion.  He called EMS and was brought into the hospital. On arrival to the ED, VS T98, HR 56, BP 137/73, RR 20, O2 100% on RA. EKG w/ inferior borderline (barely 1 mm) STE w/ possible reciprocal changes. Therefore, code STEMI was called and he received aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, and was started on epifibatide and nitroglycerin before going for cardiac catheterization. This revealed 3V disease including a likely culprit lesion in an OM. Unfortunately, intervention was not feasible given anatomy and extent of disease. Epifibatide was stopped prior to leaving the cath lab due to a developing hematoma at the site of his arterial puncture.  At the time of arrival to the CCU he denied any chest pain or other complaints. Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain and chronic lower extremity edema. It is notably negative for dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. 
This is a 65-year-old Russian-speaking male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft times two in [**2860**] with a saphenous vein graft to third obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery at that time).

Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 15436**] is a 79 yo female with a complex medical history including severe aortic stenosis, s/p bioprosthetic AVR/CABG([**2888**]-F [**Doctor Last Name **]) now with bioprosthetic restenosis and recurrent systolic heart failure requiring multiple hospitalizations, Patient also s/p CABG x1([**2888**]) and PCI-LAD([**2889**]). Cardiac status further complicated by mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension and complete heart block s/p pacemaker([**2890**]),   hypertension, and insulin-dependent diabetes. Last month, patient was admitted for severe hypertension and resultant pulmonary edema. She was treated with IV Lasix and a repeat TTE showed progression of the restenosis of her bioprosthetic valve. At that point her beta-blocker was increased to carvedilol 25 mg twice a day, her Diovan was decreased from 120 mg twice a day to 120 mg once a day and diltiazem XR was started. She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 902**] for surgical evaluation. The patient refused surgery at that time. On [**2894-11-12**], pt saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in cardiology clinic on [**2894-11-12**] where she reported progression of her symptoms. She was not compliant wtih her diet, PCP had increased her diovan to 160mg daily because her BPs at home had been high. Her dose of lasix was increased. She was subsequently admitted to CCU with congestive heart failure placed on BiPap and Lasix gtt. Cardiac surgery was reconsulted for surgical evaluation Cardiac Echocardiogram: [**2894-11-16**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-16**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is severe mitral annular calcification. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
The patient is a 79 yo woman well known to our service as she redo sternotomy/bentall with Freestyle graft/CABGx1 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 902**] on [**2894-11-22**]. Her post-op course was complicated by pericardial effusion and tamponade requiring return to the OR for mediastinal exploration.  She did develop dysrhythmias, including rapid a-fib, for which she was unsuccessfully cardioverted.  EP was consulted.  Medications were adjusted and seh did convert to SR prior to discharge.  Coumadin was not resumed post-operatively due to post-op bleeding and sinus rhythm at the time of discharge.  She did require CVVH post-operatively for volume overload and was transitioned to HD, then weaned from HD.  She also developed Serratia bacteremia which was treated with cipro, and blood cultures were clear prior to discharge.  Urinalysis was positive on discharge, and the patient was maintained on cipro pending culture and sensitivity. She returns to the ED today c/o vague abdominal pain and is found to be hypotensive with SBP in the 60s in the ED.  Central line is placed, levophed is started and CT Abdomen is pending. Initial bedside echo does not reveal evidence of pericardial effusion. 
85 year old male with past medical history significant for MI, cva x 2 and pacer has been at [**Hospital1 **] for 4 days now w/ LGIB. Has undergone tagged rbc scan, c-scope x 2 and got a total of 13U of blood over 4 days. He has per report been fairly hemodynamically stable throughout with lowest sbp in the 90s, mentating and not tachycardic. His bleeding has been intermittent, stopping, and therefore no bleeding ever seen on c-scope, just some old cauterized avms. tagged scan per report shows ? localiztion in right colon. Never had angio. Currrently he is hemodynamically stable, denies any ab pain/cp/sob/fever/chills/n/v. Just had another episode of brbpr on arrival to [**Hospital1 **]. 
The patient is a 78-year-old gentleman who initially presented to the ER on [**3092-8-11**] with one month history of lower extremity weakness, right greater than left.  He stated that the weakness developed slowly, but progressed to the point where he had difficulty climbing a flight of stairs, or rising out of a chair.  He saw a neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1674**] approximately 1 week prior to admission, and it was felt that the leg weakness was mostly proximal and possibly related to statin use.  The patient was asked to discontinue the medication at that time.  Of note, CK at that time was normal. He presented to the ED on [**3092-8-11**] for evaluation of his lower extremity weakness and had not improved since his office visit.  He was admitted to the Neurology Service.  He was noted to have dysuria in the emergency room, and a Foley catheter placement was attempted, but resulted in trauma with bleeding of the urethra and Urology was consulted who recommended continuous bladder irrigation.  Over the first 24 hours of hospitalization, the patient's blood pressure was noted to drop from 160s/80 over 100 systolic, and he became febrile at 101.2.  The patient also experienced increased white blood cell count from 8 to 13 and an increased creatinine of 1.7 to 2.4.  He was therefore transferred to the Medical Service for further workup of fever and possible sepsis. 
This is a 78 year old, right handed man, who comes in with one month of leg weakness, with the right being worse than the left.  He said that his weakness is due to steroid injection shot to his right knee back on [**3092-7-12**].  He was unable to bend his right knee so he could not go down the stairs or get up from the chair. He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 650**] a week ago, who thought he had bilateral proximal muscle weakness. The patient was asked to discontinue his statin and his CK was checked, which was found to be normal.  The patient has not noticed any improvement in his strength after the statin was discontinued. Of note, he has been having urinary incontinence for the past two months.  Today, he noticed some increased urinary frequency and burning with urination.  His last urinary tract infection was 3 weeks ago when he was treated with Bactrim. He has had right leg swelling for the past three days but denies any long car or plane rides.  He denies any problems brushing his teeth or combing his hair. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denies any fevers, chills, nausea and vomiting, headache, neck pain, weakness, numbness, tingling, visual changes, dizziness, hearing changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, hematuria, diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 172**] is a pleasant 78-year- old gentleman who was previously seen on Byros service and discharged on [**3092-8-18**]. He had previously undergone evacuation for right acute subdural hemorrhage. During his prior admission, he had a traumatic Foley placed and subsequently had copious excretion of blood from his catheter. He required placement of a three-way catheter with continuous irrigation for several days. Ultimately, he was discontinued to rehabilitation with a regular Foley. On [**3092-8-22**], he was brought to the Emergency Room from his rehabilitation facility with increasing hematuria. He had previously been doing well. Per report, the nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 15453**] the Foley due to minimal urine output and had been noticing an increasing amount of clots being excreted. He had a creatinine of 4.5 at rehabilitation. Ultimately, he was sent to the [**Hospital6 253**] for further evaluation and management of acute renal failure with hematuria. When he was seen at [**Hospital6 1991**], he complained of pain in his penis, as well as secondary to Foley placement. He denies any nausea, vomiting, chest pain, palpitations or shortness of breath. He otherwise denied complaint of any new issues. 
87 y/o F and resident of [**Hospital 99**] Rehab with PMH asthma on chronic steroids, s/p GI bleed, h/o diverticulosis, HTN, hypothyroidism who presents with respiratory distress from [**Hospital 99**] Rehab to ED. Per report, pt had developed fevers to 101, increased oxygen requirement, wheezing and shortness of breath. Pt was unable to provide history on presentation but per ED notes complained of RUQ abd pain and [**Hospital **] Rehab nurses had reported that pt was exposed to influenza from neighboring resident at [**Hospital 99**] Rehab. . In [**Name (NI) **], pt initially had T 103.5, BP 187/69, HR 102, RR 44, O2 sats low 90s on 6 L NC. Wbc nl with no significant left shift, lactate 2.3, U/A was positive for UTI and CXR showed ?R hilar opacity c/w PNA. Pt was given Vancomycin/Levofloxacin/Flagyl, Ativan 1mg x 2, Tylenol #3 for pain. Her sats began to worsen and later on [**2-10**], pt became hypertensive with BP 190/90, increased RR to 40s with increased bibasilar crackles and was given 40 IV lasix. Pt was shortly thereafter placed on BIPAP 5/5 on [**2-11**] and placed on NTG gtt with improvement in sats and RR. Pt became tachypneic late last night as well with drop in O2 sats to 80s, CPAP was attempted again but pt could not tolerate mask. She was placed on NRB and O2 has been titrated down to 5 L FM. She was admitted to MICU for further management 
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known patient lastname 15478**] is a 76-year-old Russian female who presented in 11/00 with congestive heart failure manifested by DOE and lower extremity edema.  Transthoracic echocardiograms in 11/00 and [**1-31**] both revealed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 15479**] ASD.  Cardiac catheterization in [**2701-5-3**] revealed normal coronary arteries with a QP to QS of 3:1.  She was admitted to cardiothoracic surgery for repair of her ASD. 
This is a 63 y/o M with a history of obesity, HTN, NIDDM, Hypercholesterolemia, DVT s/p IVC filter placement and PE on coumadin, who presents with worsening SOB over the past 3 weeks. He was seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 1298**] on [**12-25**] for SOB, and per patient, diagnosed with "bronchitis." He was given Advair, which did not relieve his symptoms. Since then he has become gradually more short of breath, especially with exertion, such that he has to rest after walking only a few feet. At rest, he denies SOB. He sleeps on 2 pillows at baseline but notes that he is now completely unable to lie flat. He also notes a dry cough that developed a few days ago and a sensation that there is "something" in his chest that he just can't cough up. He denies fevers, chest pain, left arm or jaw pain, sweating, leg pain or swelling, and weight gain. (Baseline weight is 338lbs, was 335lbs at PCP's office today). He also denies recent travel, sick contacts, smoking, and h/o asthma. He notes that this dyspnea is somewhat similar but less severe than when he had a PE in [**3390**]; at that time he was completely unable to walk. He re-presented to PCP's office today and was found to be tachypneic w/ RR28, O2Sat 945, HR 108, BP 130/100. Of note, he decreased his coumadin dose last week as his INR was 3.7 on [**1-9**]. In the ED, vitals were T 97.6, P 106-120, BP 122-134/70-93, RR 25-30, O2Sat 98%RA. He was given levofloxacin 750mg IV x1 and nebs x1. He had a CXR and chest CT to rule out PE, but was unable to complete the scan because he could not lie flat. Due to concern for PE, he was bolused with heparin and then started on heparin gtt. On exam, he again denies CP and notes that dyspnea is improved with rest, nebs, and supplemental 02. 
78 yo Russian speaking F with h/o pulmonary HTN, CHF, OSA on home O2 who initially admitted on [**2707-6-3**] from home with vomiting, loss of appetite x 1 month. Diarrhea x 1 week. Per ED notes, pt also c/o RLQ/RUQ pain; rates pain as [**9-11**] lasting several days. Pt is also chronically on home O2 2-3L NC for OSA, CHF and pulmonary hypertension. . ED COURESE: VS afebrile, HR 62, BP 144/85, RR 20, 95% RA. Exam notable for RUQ/RLQ tenderness to palp, guaic neg. Given zofran 8 mg IV x 1 with improvement in sxs. CT showed no new changes. Ready for d/c but then nauseous. No abx in ED. Given 10 mg compazine as well. . Admitted to medicine for diarrhea. On arrival, hx obtained from interpreter. Pt c/o of right > left abd pain for unclear duration of time, also with nausea/vomiting; diarrhea 3-4 days ago but none since. No chest pain/pressure, SOB, cough. No GU sxs. Poor appetite for several weeks. On floor pt found to be hypoxic on O2 4LNC O2 sats 85%, CXR c/w pulm edema, she was given 40mg IV x 2, nebs, and put out 1.5L UOP, she was also put on a NRB with improvement in O2 Sats to 95%. However, patient kept trying to pull off her NRB mask leading to [**Last Name (LF) 15577**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for more intensive care and monitoring. 
79 yo F with multifactorial chronic hypoxemia and dyspnea thought due to diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension thought secondary to a chronic ASD and COPD on 5L home oxygen admitted with complaints of worsening shortness of breath. . The patient is a poor historian and therefore history was obtained in part from medical record and in part from interview with Russian interpreter and the patient. . The patient has chronic severe dyspnea requiring numerous inpatient hospitalizations. She reports that her breathing was bad at baseline but appeared acutely worse over the past 2 days. She denies any associated symptoms including no chest pain, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, fevers, worsened lower extremity edema or weight gain. The patient does note that her lower extremities were more erythematous and uncomfortable than normal. By patient report this episode is entirely the same as her prior episodes of acute on chronic dyspnea exacerbation. Reports compliance with all of her medications. . The patient initially presented to the [**Hospital1 2148**] ED with complaints of SOB. Vitals on presentation there are unavailable as are all records of assessment and treatment. Written report by nurses upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] describe CXR at [**Hospital1 2148**] consistent with volume overload and treatment with furosemide 40mg IV, nitropaste 1inch and aspirin. She refused foley placement. Labs and EKG were largely unremarkable and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, 73 132/72 22 95% 4L. The patient refused/did not tolerate BiPAP therapy. She received an additional dose of furosemide 40mg IV. . Of note, the patient is frequently admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxemia likely in part due to poor medication compliance. Most recently, she was admitted from [**2708-5-25**] - [**2708-6-3**] when she was successfully diuresed though did require overnight transfer to the ICU for hypoxia. During that hospitalization, cardiology consult recommended a right heart cath for evaluation of response to sildenafil but the patient refused. Pulmonary consult recommended an empiric, compassionate sildenafil trial due to severe dyspneic symptomology preventing outpatient living. This trial was to occur as an outpatient under her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the patient did tolerate an inpatient trial without hypotension. During that hospitalization, the patient's home amiodarone was discontinued out of low likelihood for amiodarone toxicity.

Fib, obstructive sleep apnea, renal insufficiency, bilateral lower extremity discomfort, and an atrial septal defect. She is a poor historian and information was obtained in part from her medical record. Ms. [**Known patient lastname 15478**] was admitted on [**2709-1-7**] for hypoxia and reported recent orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturia dyspnea, but [**Date Range 15593**] fever/chills, N/V/D, chest pain or cough. . In the ED, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 15594**] initial vitals were: T: 98, P: 60, BP: 145/60, R: 20, O2 Sat: 100% on NRB. A [**2709-1-7**] CXR indicated unchanged cardiomegaly and low lung volumes as well as mild pulmonary edema. Lasix (80 mg IV) was given which led to some improvement in her symptoms. Ms. [**Known patient lastname 15478**] received IV Vanco, but refused Bipap. . In the MICU, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 15478**] was given additional Lasix (80 mg IVx2) which led to a diuresis of a 3.2 L. A [**2709-1-7**] ECG revealed left axis deviation, non-specific intraventricular conduction delay and non-specific ST-T wave changes -- findings considered to be similiar to her [**2708-12-6**] ECG. A [**2709-1-8**] CXR indicated mild edema, mostly in her right lung as well as a possible small right pleural effusion. She received 6L of O2 as well as morphine sulfate (2-4 mg) for her left lower extremity pain. She weighed 103.7 kg (228.1 lbs) when she was transfered to [**Doctor Last Name **]. . When she was transfered to [**Doctor Last Name **] on [**2709-1-8**], Ms. [**Known patient lastname 15594**] vitals were: T96.9  BP 110/56 HR 65  RR 28 O2 86-88% on 6L. Her heart rate was paced and her oxygen was weaned down to 5L, her pre-admission level. Her [**2709-1-9**] CXR revealed findings consistent with worsening CHF as well as an increased density at the right base suggestive of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. While on [**Doctor Last Name **], Ms. [**Known patient lastname 15478**] [**Last Name (Titles) 15593**] SOB, chest pain/tightness, and mentated appropriately.

84 M russian speaking, h/o CAD, NIDDM, HTN, CKD (baseline cre ~1.3), h/o recurrent aspiration PNA, who presents from home, after his family noted elevated blood sugars. history obtained from son, who states pt was feeling well until 3-4d ago, when he noted increasing LH/dizziness, drowsiness, and a feeling of "fog" attributed to recent increases in his neurontin dose (for LE pain [**3-15**] spinal stenosis, dose increased from 100mg tid to 300mg tid then 600mg in AM, 300mg [**Hospital1 **]). On the morning of admission, son noted that pt had increasing urinary frequency, which pt stated had been going on for [**3-16**] weeks. FSBS was 500s, and son activated EMS. Pt had apparently not been checking FSBS or taking his glypizide x 2-3 weeks. ROS per son negative for f/c/ns/cp/n/v/abd pain/melena, hematuria, hemetemesis, rash, joint pains, weight loss. In ED VS= 99.1 109 140/111 87%RA. pt was coughing, afebrile. Per report, O2 requirement increased, and pt would not tolerate CPAP. SBPs intially dropped to 80s/30s prior to intubation, however recovered with 2-3L IVF.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is an 80-year-old Spanish-speaking woman with an extensive medical history notable particularly for auto-immune hepatitis cirrhosis and encephalopathy who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 341**] on [**2934-4-17**].  She was discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation facility. Her last admission was notable for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography that was complicated by acute renal failure and pancreatitis. On this admission, [**4-28**], the patient was brought from [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation reportedly for a general decline in her condition that occurred over several days to weeks as well as an apparent complaint of more recent chest and abdominal pain.  The records at the rehabilitation facility indicate the patient has been increasingly lethargic and confused over the past several days and exhibited worsening lower extremity edema.  The rehabilitation facility was unable to maintain intravenous access.  Laboratories there revealed, among other things, an increased white blood cell count and worsening liver function tests.  Their records did not show any recent history of fever. The patient was unable to give history secondary to encephalopathy, for which she has had multiple admissions in the past for.  To be clear, she has a history of multiple events hospitalization specifically for encephalopathy. On the last hospitalization (ending on [**2934-4-19**]), she was admitted to the ACOVE Medicine Service with vague complaints; including weakness, confusion, and mild epigastric tenderness.  She was found to have an elevated bilirubin, and it was felt that common bile duct was dilated.  She underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**2934-4-12**].  There was an unsuccessful attempt to cannulate the papilla despite sphincterotomy.  Post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography course was complicated by pancreatitis and acute renal failure which responded modestly to intravenous fluids and holding her ACE inhibitor and diuretics.  Pancreatitis resulted in bile fluid.  An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**2934-4-15**] had a motion artifact but revealed changes in liver consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. No dilation of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ducts. There were stones/sludge in the gallbladder and thrombosis of the right anterior and right posterior branches of the portal vein.  The patient was placed on Actigall and sent to rehabilitation.  Her white blood cell count at that time was 16.6, total bilirubin was 3.2, and creatinine was 2.9. On this admission, in the Emergency Department, the patient was briefly hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s which responded well to the intravenous fluids.  Also of note, at her rehabilitation facility, she was found to be in atrial fibrillation. During this hospital admission, she ruled out for a myocardial infarction.  The Congestive Heart Failure Service was consulted during this admission.  They recommended discontinuing her amiodarone and felt that the patient's fluid overload was secondary to cirrhosis and low albumin in conjunction with pulmonary hypertension that was not related to systolic dysfunction.  The patient was also found to have a lower lobe pneumonia.  She had been treated with Levofloxacin and Flagyl with an associated leukocytosis and hypothermia. Her hospital stay, prior to being transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, was complicated by acute renal failure (secondary to acute tubular necrosis), and relative hypotension with atrial fibrillation, and hypercalcemia (with calcium levels as high as 12), and creatinine as high as 3.6, and hypernatremia (her sodium was 155 when she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit).  In addition, her total bilirubin had been rising with worsening coagulopathy.  Her INR was 2.7, and her total bilirubin was 4.3 when she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. Given her poor hospital course, the patient was initially do not resuscitate/do not intubate by the family; especially given her history of cirrhosis and auto-immune hepatitis. However, on [**5-1**], new members of the family had come from [**Male First Name (un) 1042**], and a family meeting was held, and her code status was reversed.  She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of her worsening coagulopathy, hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, and declining mental status. 
The patient is a 60 year old female with multiple medical problems including congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, who presented with complaint of bright red blood per rectum, coffee ground hematemesis. The patient is a resident of [**Hospital6 13670**] Center.  She she received two units of packed red blood cells on [**1-29**] and CBC checked on [**1-31**] showed a hematocrit of 27.9.  She was noted at rehabilitation to have an episode of tarr5y stools over the past two days and had bright red blood per rectum and coffee ground emesis.  The morning of admission, she was found to EMS with blood pressure of 100/60; heart rate of 101.  She was brought to the Emergency Room where her heart rate was 103; systolic blood pressure of 90, which increased to 100 with normal saline and tubal lavage. The EG showed clear fluid with mucus but no bile.  Stool was dark.  Heme positive.  Hematocrit was found to be 16.6.  Left femoral central line was placed. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No fevers, chills, vomiting or abdominal pain or hematochezia.  No ANSAID.  No chest pain, no short of breath.

HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE PANCOLITIS WITH RESPONSE TO PO FLAGYL AS OUTPATIENT:  The patient was started on po vancomycin.  Given dilaudid for pain control.  The patient was put on isolation precautions for C. difficile colitis with positive C. difficile toxin.  The patient was closely monitored for signs of toxic megacolon by serial abdominal exam and daily KUBs.  The next day, the patient's white blood cell count increased to 40 with 12% bands.  The patient was started on IV Flagyl, and the following day was given a trial of IVIG with interval improvement in white count and metabolic acidosis.  The patient was put on bowel rest and was decompressed with a nasogastric tube for one day, and with rectal tube for the duration of three days with interval improvement in colonic distention as evidenced by clinical exam and radiographic confirmation.  Subsequently, the patient's IV Flagyl was stopped, and the patient continued on po vancomycin.  The patient was started on clear liquids which were to be advanced slowly to small amounts of solids.  The patient was followed this admission by surgical, infectious disease and gastroenterology consults. 2) RESPIRATORY STATUS WITH OBJECTIVE DYSPNEA:  During the hospitalization, the patient had complained objectively of severe dyspnea.  However, the patient's oxygenation had remained normal, and ABG analysis showed no hypocarbia or hypoxia.  It was presumed that the patient likely had emphysema and this was chronic progression of his chronic lung disease.  However, there was no evidence of CO2 trapping.  There were no infiltrates on chest x-ray, and chest CT was performed which showed moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  The patient had undergone right-sided thoracentesis with ultrasound guidance with removal of 500 cc of clear transudate.  This was attributed to likely mild congestive heart failure in light of interval decrease of ejection fraction, as was found during this admission by echocardiogram, which showed an ejection fraction of 40% which was an interval decrease from more than 55% in [**2557**]. Of note, the patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled and were negative.  Therefore, the patient's dyspnea was thought to be 
The patient is an 86-year-old Russian-only speaking male with a history of atrial fibrillation who refused anticoagulation therapy, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal insufficiency and peripheral vascular disease who was admitted on [**6-7**] to the Medical Service at [**Hospital1 341**] with Clostridium difficile colitis. The patient had previously failed outpatient course of Flagyl and was admitted with GI an Surgery follow up.  He was treated with a 20 day course of p.o. vancomycin, an eight day course of intravenous Flagyl and IVIG with slow resolution of his GI symptoms. On hospital day 15 patient was found to be unresponsive with a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure activity.  He was transferred to the MICU with close neurologic follow up.  He had no past history of seizure disorder and then extensive workup that followed did not reveal any obvious cause.  He had a negative CT and MR of his head, a negative EEG and a lumbar puncture was not performed.  The patient's course in the SICU was complicated by a respiratory decompensation that was felt to be secondary to his underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with the addition of a presumed aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis.  The patient was transferred back to the floor on [**6-28**] with a post transfer course significant for continued abdominal pain and some distended loops of bowel on a KUB possibly secondary to an ileus as well as shortness of breath with a left lower lobe infiltrate.  He was given a ten day course of levofloxacin for presumed aspiration pneumonia with the last dose on [**7-3**].  He received multiple bedside swallow evaluations and a video swallow study which showed aspiration to all consistencies.  The patient was transferred from the floor to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**7-6**] for respiratory decompensation with rate going into the 40's and oxygen saturations decreasing into the 80's despite good suctioning.  He was electively intubated at that point for respiratory distress. 
The patient is a 62 year-old gentleman with a history of severe dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed in [**3387**] by catheterization, at which time he was found to have normal coronaries and elevated PA pressures of 80/45 with a cardiac output of 2.9 and 4+ mitral regurgitation.  Since the summer of [**3392**] patient has been stable.  It has been class 2 heart failure maintained on ACE inhibitor, Lasix, Digoxin and amiodarone.  In [**3394-4-23**], the patient had deterioration in his status with increased fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal pain.  Patient was found to be H. pylori positive, treated with antibiotics and on [**4-1**] had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed chronic inactive gastritis.  At the end of [**Month (only) 541**] the patient noted worsening of dyspnea on exertion as well as orthopnea. Metricor and Lasix were administered.  Patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization and for inotropic therapy.  At a catheterization on the day of admission the PA pressures were 66/26.  Cardiac index was 1.4.  His pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 24.  He had limited angiography but a patent LAD.  Patient was started on milrinone of .5 and his PA pressures were 64/22 and a cardiac index of 1.9 in the catheterization laboratory.  Patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for milrinone therapy and tailored therapy. On arrival to the Cardiac Care Unit patient denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, palpitations, nausea or vomiting.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname 14549**] is a 61 y/o F with hx of mild dHF, HTN, bicuspid AV, s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin (INR 2.4 on admission), severe asthma (on prednisone) who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for [**Hospital 15981**] after presenting there for syncope.  She has a hx of severe asthma and has been on prednisone for the last 6-7 years with inability to wean due to increased wheezing and SOB.  She states that over the last 6 months she has had more frequent episodes of "blacking out" that seem to occur after using her asthma inhalers.  During each episode she denies CP, SOB, but has some nausea.  Yesterday, while at her daughter's house she was sitting on the couch and blacked out on two separate occasions lasting a few seconds and then she came two.  She was hospitalized [**3033-8-19**] year ago for similar c/o and was monitored continuously on Tele, with no events detected. At OSH, VS 98.8, 121/48, 48, 21 98%RA.  EKG obtained at OSH was c/w CHB with infranodal escape with RB at 43BPM.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  Upon transfer in the ED she had another syncopal episode and was apparently in Sinus tachy to 110 at this point.  EKG at this time showed sinus tachycardia with RBBB.  EP was called and was told to give Metop, but it was not given.  They repleted his K and sent admitted him to the CCU. Upon admission to the CCU, initial EKG showed sinus tachycardic with 1st degree AVB with a LBBB pattern.  During initial evaluation, the patient had a 9 second pause on tele during which time the patient reported "blacking out".  Her rhythm returned spontaneously and repeat EKG at this time showed CHB with RBBB pattern.  After which, emergent temporary pacer was placed in the right ventricle via a right IJ Cordis.  The wires are situated in the posterior RV, placement confirmed by CXR post-procedure. She is currently being paced at 50bpm, MA 5mV.

He notes feeling suspicious of them because the bottle was already open.  They did not drink any of it.  He became violently sick the next day and he noted that the Midori tested like a sweet liquid.  Despite his suspicions, he drank three large glasses of it.  There is some question that he was drinking vodka earlier in the evening.  Although he states these friends did this to him, he cannot describe any possible motive they might have and refuses to reveal their names.  He denies feeling concerned or afraid at this time and does not plan to report the incident to the police.  The patient admits to drinking alcohol on a daily basis.  He states he checked himself into detoxification facility on Tuesday after having several days of severe nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.  It is unclear what he did from Thursday to Tuesday.  The patient denies that it was any kind of suicide attempt.  He reports feeling in good spirits and not wishing to ever do himself any harm.  He states that he has his family to live for but has not seen his sister for three months.  Three years ago when his mother died, she ask him to keep the family together which he states is impossible.  He was checked into a detoxification facility [**2985-11-27**].  He reports feeling poorly, continuing to have nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain.  On [**2985-12-1**], he says that he had not urinated since entering the program.  At [**Hospital 1543**] Hospital, his blood urea nitrogen was 183 and creatinine was 60 with a bicarbonate of 14 and anion gap of 18.  On arrival to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department, he seized and was treated with Ativan.  He was then admitted to the MICU and was treated with emergent hemodialysis for a bicarbonate of 7 and potassium of 6.0. His creatinine at that time was down to 22. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was afebrile, heart rate 95, blood pressure 153/93, respiratory rate 22.  The patient was 98% on 100% nonrebreather.  In general, he is a 38 year old male in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination is normocephalic and atraumatic.  The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Anicteric sclera.  Neck is supple.  Lungs revealed diffuse bilateral wheezing.  Cardiovascular is tachycardic, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, with decreased bowel sounds.  Extremities revealed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Neurologically, alert and oriented times zero, moving all four extremities spontaneously. LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 15.2, hematocrit 42.0, platelet count 216,000, 81% neutrophils, 10% lymphocytes,  Sodium 130, potassium 5.7, chloride 85, bicarbonate 8, blood urea nitrogen 178, creatinine 22.2, glucose 132, anion gap 33.  Calcium 9.5, magnesium 3.1, phosphate 16.3, troponin 0.08. Chest x-ray shows mild congestive heart failure.  Head CT negative for bleed, but small hypodensities bilaterally towards the vertex in the frontoparietal region. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 84 beats per minute.  Normal intervals.  Questionable nonspecific changes in the T waves in V1 through V6.  No acute ST-T wave changes. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1.  Acute renal failure - Initially, the patient was treated in the MICU with emergent hemodialysis for a bicarbonate of 7 and potassium of 6.0.  It was felt likely acute tubular necrosis secondary to ingestion most suspicious for ethylene glycol although difficult to diagnose as the patient presented seven to eight days after possible ingestion.  He was also anuric times two weeks.  Renal ultrasound showed enlarged kidneys bilaterally with left measuring 14 centimeters and right measuring 13 centimeters.  No stones and no hydronephrosis.  No oxalate crystals were seen in his urine.  Now after two weeks, his urine output is beginning to increase to 200cc per 24 hours.  His initial laboratories on [**2985-12-2**], were negative for ethylene glycol, acetone methanol and isopropanol with a serum anion gap of 33 and plasma osmolar gap of 15 but acute renal failure may cause both elevation in the serum anion gap and osmolar gap, making 
This is an 83-year-old gentleman who had had an MI [**49**] years ago and has hypertension, congestive heart failure and hypercholesterolemia.  The patient had an abnormal stress test, following which he had a cardiac catheterization which revealed severe triple vessel disease. The cardiac catheterization revealed disease in the LAD, diagonal and right pulmonary artery.  The patient was, therefore, referred for us for elective coronary artery bypass grafting.  His preoperative echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction between 30-35%. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 4235**] is a 83 year old male with a 2 month history of dyspnea on exertion. He was referred for cardiac catheterization after echo showed depressed LV function with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. Echocardiogram also notable for [**11-22**]+ mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension. Subsequent cardiac catheterization was significant for left main and three vessel disease. He is now admitted for surgical revascularization. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8949**] is an 87 year old male with a history significant for atrial fibrillation not on coumadin due to falls, dementia, CAD s/p CABG [**2712**], CVA [**2723**], chronic systolic CHF with EF reportedly 17% (although no documentation), chronic urinary retention with indwelling catheter, recently hospitalized in mid-[**Month (only) 202**] s/p fall/UTI, admitted with lethargy, hypoxemia, hypotension to the ICU Patient was admitted from nursing home because of concern re. lethargy, tachypnea, tachycardia from [**Hospital6 1624**]. In the nursing home, he was noted to be increasingly agitated over the past several days. Also was lethargic, although easily arousable. In addition, was found to have a poor appetite. In addition, labs were sent which showed a high white count, and patient was transferred here for further management. Vitals at the nursing home prior to transfer were 97.8 116 101/59 38 93%RA. In the ED, initial VS were: 97.5 109 117/89 27 100% Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies shortness of breath, cough, dyspnea or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations. Denies constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark or bloody stools. Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin changes. 
72-year-old morbidly obese woman with a history of thyroid cancer and atrial fibrillation who recently underwent a colonoscopy by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1915**] here at [**Hospital1 820**].  The patient notes that on [**7-6**] she had a colonoscopy and a few days after that she developed severe right-sided pelvic and abdominal pain.  This basically passed over the course of two days, but she saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1915**] in followup for this.  It was not associated with fever, vomiting, change in bowel habits.  A CT scan was obtained on [**7-20**].  This revealed a 15 cm right adnexal lesion, which appeared to have "increased in size in comparison to a [**Hospital1 18**] MRI dated [**3084-1-24**] and findings most consistent with ? fibroid versus ovarian fibroma.  The mass is inseparable on imaging studies from the sigmoid colon and cecum.  Also noted was a calcified thrombosed aneurysm of the GDA and likely second aneurysm within the left upper abdomen.  She is here for discussion of treatment options. [**Known patient firstname **] has had additional imaging studies and brings with her today a MRI from [**Location (un) 1106**] Imaging.  She has been followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for this problem in the past and has basically been observed during this time period.  [**Known patient firstname **] has been reluctant to undergo surgery for this mass in the past. The patient was seen for follow up visit on [**3091-8-12**]. She returned after having had a MRI to evaluate her pelvic mass at an outside institution.  She had a repeat of her MRI performed once again at [**Location (un) 1106**] Imaging and this revealed, as expected, a slight enlargement of the large 15-17 cm right adnexal mass.  It is unclear once again whether this is a fibroid or a tumor of the ovary.  She also had noted on her CT scan an abnormality to the blood supply within the celiac axis. She has undergone an MRA and this reveals significant stenosis of the proximal celiac artery.  There are also dilated anterior and posterior pancreaticoduodenal arteries with aneurysmal dilations and collaterals in the root of the mesentery adjacent the SMA.  A renal lesion was also identified and was advised for evaluation in six months for a pre and post contrast renal MRI.  Also noted was a 3-mm cystic lesion in the pancreatic body.  This could also be followed in six months. The patient was recommended to have a preoperative evaluation. The patient had several follow up visits between [**7-/3092**] and 03/[**3092**]. She returned on [**3092-4-6**] for a followup evaluation. In the interim time period, the patient had elected to proceed with surgery but unfortunately fell and had a urinary tract infection as well as pneumonia.  She was admitted here to the hospital.  We had to delay her surgery. Post-hospitalization followup chest x-rays have been done.  Her most recent was on [**4-4**] and this reveals little change from her prior chest x-ray, which shows "improved but not complete resolution of a right middle lobe pneumonia," followup is recommended. 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 16027**] is a 75 y/o female with a h/o a recent episode of ischemic colitis, thyroid cancer and OSA who initially presented to the ER with complaints of sharp epigastric abdominal pain that radiated to her back, associated with nausea, shortness of breath, one episode of emesis and constipation.  The patient was concerned that this pain could be her ischemic colitis recurrence or related to her worsening back pain so she called her doctor who referred her into the ER.  Additionally she has been experiencing shaking chills overnight Sunday and Monday nights, she says that she woke up at 2am both nights with shaking chills and had difficulty sleeping from the chills. In the ED, initial VS were: 99.2, 84, 116/58, 16, 98% on RA.  On examination by the resident she was noted to be febrile to 104.4 and rigoring, she was given acetaminophen and empirically covered with vancomycin and cefepime.  Additionally, she was found to have blood pressures that were discordant by 15mmHg in each arm and given her description of stabbing epigastric pain that radiated to her back and her h/o ischemic colitis she was sent for CTA torso.  The CTA did not show any evidence aortic disection or ischemic colitis, but did show a large 1cmx1.4cm obstructing renal stone with associated moderate left hydronephrosis.  Urology was consulted who recommended urgent placement of a percutaneous nephrostomy tube with IR.  She was also given 100mcg of fentanyl for pain and 8mg of zofran for nausea, a total of 2LNS and admitted to the MICU for further management.  VS on transfer: 101.2, 96, 108/62, 24, 98% on RA. . On arrival to the MICU, initial VS were: 98.3, 89, 104/59, 23, 98% on RA.  Shortly after her arrival to the MICU her blood pressure fell to the 80's systolic, she was bolused 1L NS and taken to IR for percutaneous nephrostomy placement.  The procedure was uncomplicated but on return to the MICU was rigoring and uncomfortable. . Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies cough or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness. Denies diarrhea.

67 yo F with presenting from clinic complaining of 3 bloody stools 5 days pta and 1 bloody stool on the day pta, went to clinic today and was found to have elevated bilirubin from 11.9 on [**7-28**] to 22.8 on [**8-3**] so was admitted to evaluate for biliary obstruction/cholangitis.  Pt has mild RUQ pain, but denies, nausea, vommiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, and husband has not noticed any change in mental status. . She was recently admitted on [**7-14**] for choledocholithiasis, diagnosed by ultrasound in ED, underwent ERCP on [**7-14**], where sphincterotomy was performed, stones were extracted and 10 F Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed.  Afterwarks she complained of persistant nausea and RUQ pain radiating to back. She underwent paracentesis on [**7-18**] and 1800 cc of fluid was removed.  Her total bilirubin rose from 5.3 at admission ([**7-14**]); to 7.1 on [**7-20**].  She underwent repeat ERCP on [**7-21**] which demonstrated purulent bile, sludge, and stones.  The stent was exchanged for another 10F Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] stent and she was started on Zosyn.  Following the procedure, her symptoms of pain and nausea abated, but her total bilirubin continued to rise and her diarrhea, which had resolved, returned on [**7-23**]. Stool was negative for C.diff x 2.  On [**7-27**], she underwent cardiac catherization as part of her evaluation for liver transplantation and was found to be 60% stenosed in her LAD and 70% stenosed in her LCX.  As these lesions may be clinically insignificant, a nuclear stress test was recommended but has not yet been performed.  By discharge her bilirubin had continued to rise and was 11.9 on the day of discharge ([**7-28**]).  Hepatology suggested that the cause was intrahepatic cholestasis secondary to drugs and recommending stopping Zosyn, starting Actigall, and obtaining an MRCP.  She was deemed stable for discharge, and upon return to clinic this further elevated bilirubin was discovered and pt was admitted for further evaluation. 
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with aortic stenosis which is a relatively new diagnosis from [**2850**]. Approximately two months ago, she began developing dyspnea and chest pressure with walking upstairs, as well as intermittent mild pedal edema. A recent echocardiogram revealed severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of <0.8cm2 and a mean gradient of 37mmHg. She has been referred for possible aortic valve replacement surgery. If surgery was deemed too high risk, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 169**] would like her evaluated for CoreValve trial of percutaneous aortic valve replacement. There was mention of a calcified aorta on a previous note. 
85F with critical Aortic Stenosis, diastolic Heart Failure, and Coronary Artery Disease who presented with dyspnea since [**2-20**]. She had been symptomatic from her aortic stenosis with dyspnea at rest, worse with exertion for the past several months. She also experiences angina with any exertion and had 1 syncopal episode 2 months ago in setting of NTG use. Pt developed shortness of breath last night, similar to her usual dyspnea, worsened overnight. In am she called EMS who found her to be tachypneic to the 30s, with 02 sats in the 70s. She was placed on a NRB with increase in 02 to 90s, BP was initally elevated to systolic 180. She was noted to have crackles throughout her lung fields on exam and was given 60mg IV lasix as well as a NTG tab in the field. On arrival her VS 97.7 65 135/52 100% (bipap) crackles were persistently appreciated and she was placed on BiPAP. She was given 1 full dose ASA. Had a CXR which showed low lung volumes, b/l effusions and pulmonary edema. ECG showed no change from prior. Labs notable for negative cardiac enzymes, normal CBC and renal function, normal electrolytes, lactate 2.7. On BiPAP her RR decreased to 18, BP stabilized at 90-110s. UOP >700cc.

This is a 68 year old man, with a PMH significant for A. FIB with RVR, Lower GI bleed 3 weeks prior to admission, severe lung disease including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, believed to be [**12-29**] rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary hypertension, and COPD admitted to [**Hospital 1543**] Hospital on [**2989-10-23**] after 1 day of moderate shortness of breath and cough productive of yellow sputum as well as two weeks of progressive difficulty walking. He was treated for HAP with levofloxacin, pip/tazo, and vancomycin. A blood culture was positive for Ecoli x 1, sensitive to pip/tazo and ceftriaxone. He improved symptomatically, and his antibiotics were narrowed to pip/tazo alone for unclear reasons. His pulmonary status returned to baseline by report, but then he went into atrial fibrillation with RVR to the 180s. He was started on digoxin in addition to his home dronaderone and diltiazem, and returned to sinus. While working with PT in anticipation of discharge he was found to be increasingly weak. He also complained of escalating neck pain. A spinal MRI was obtained which showed severe c3-c4 spinal compression with cord edema. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for Neurosurgical eval by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**]. . On the floor here at [**Hospital1 **] he was comfortable on 4L NC, and by report was at his baseline from a pulmonary standpoint. He was taken to surgery the following day. His surgical course was uncomplicated. . In the MICU he was intubated and sedated. He was transferred to the MICU to remain intubated due to his underlying pulmonary issues and concern from his pulmonologist that if he were extubated too early and needed to be reintubate, it would be very risky given his underlying spinal pathology. He was extubated successfully on [**11-3**], but had difficulty swallowing pills so speech and swallow was consulted. On [**11-4**] he converted from normal sinus rhythm to Afib with rates in the 90s-100s, but was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable.

He was scheduled for an outpatient stress test on [**3182-6-3**]. The exercise stress test was positive (6.75 minutes [**Doctor Last Name 3942**] protocol, 66% max PHR, stopping due progressive anginal symptoms with 9/10 arm pain radiating to the chest). The MIBI showed a reversible defect in the lateral wall and he was sent for cardiac cath on the day of admission. . A cypher stent was placed into LM/LAD. It was attempted to place also a stent into the mid-distal LAD lesion but failed. During the catheterization, he developed intermittent CP. His SBP went up into the 220s and he received IV nitro. Next, the question of a dissected LAD came up based on the angiographic image of the wire. He received intracoronary Nitro (200 mcg) to dilate the vessel and identify any dissection which could not be confirmed. After this administration, his SBP dropped into the 70s and he developed a vagal reaction with HR in upper 30s to lower 40s. This event lasted approx 5 minutes and he responded to IV atropin, very brief dopamine drip and IVF. There was no LOC but some associated CP. There were transient ischemic changes during the procedure (ST depressions in V4-V6). He was exposed to more than 350cc of dye, about one hour of fluoro and he lost a significant amount of blood. He received Angiomax in the cath lab and was started on a bicarb drip. He next was transferred to the CCU for monitoring after the above mentioned events. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 16373**] is a 77 yo man with 3 vessel CAD s/p CABG [**7-7**] and s/p LAD stenting [**6-7**] who presents with crescendo chest discomfort over the last week. . He had done well since his last stent placement in [**6-7**], with no need for nitroglycerin until two weeks prior to admission. He developed chest discomfort with light activity such as climbing one flight of stairs or carrying packages. The chest discomfort was sternal in location, sometimes radiating to his bilateral shoulders, arms, and jaw, [**6-10**] in intensity, and relieved at first within minutes of one nitroglycerin. It felt like his prior angina. He had some associated diaphoresis and nausea, without dyspnea or palpitations. His chest discomfort was not pleuritic in character nor did it feel like heartburn. His nitroglycerin requirement increased over the weeek to the point where he was taking 4 nitroglycerin per episode, leading him to seek medical attention. . In the ED, his vitals were T 97.3, P 52, BP 151/61, RR 16, O2 99% RA. He was given ASA 325mg. He was taken to the cath lab where he was found to have 80% stenosis of the LAD at D1 origin with patent proximal LAD stent, and 70% stenosis of the mid RCA. The procedure was complicated by dissection of the LAD, necessitating placement of DESx2 to the LAD. His D1 was occluded post stenting. . Upon arrival to the floor, the patient initially complained of [**7-11**] chest discomfort that improved with lopressor and IV morphine. . Review of systems is positive for prior stroke, claudications, and night time leg cramps. He denies any history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He does have chronic constipation and urinary frequency. All of the other review of systems were negative. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or presyncope. 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 16378**] is an 81 yo female with a history of atrial fibrillation diastolic heart failure, s/p cholecystectomy, and hospitalization for ESBL Klebsiella UTI ([**3329-8-24**]) who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for work-up of LFT abnormalities. Per OSH records patient was noted to be jaundiced while in rehab on [**3329-8-30**]. Her AP at that time was 568, AST 198, ALT 300 and TBili 5.58. She underwent abdominal u/s on [**9-4**] normal liver and bilateral pleural effusions. On [**9-8**] she had CT Abd at [**Hospital3 412**] Hosp as an outpt that showed normal liver, spleen, pancreas and bilateral pleural effusions. Following this study, she was transferred from rehab to [**Hospital3 **] on [**3329-9-8**] for further work-up. On admission to [**Hospital1 **] her AP was 1206 and bili 15.9. Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up of her LFT abnormalities . Patient was transferred directly to the medical floor. On arrival to the floor her SBPs were in the 70's. After about 500cc NS SBPs increased to the 80's. Her temperature was 95.2 and she was sating 95% on 2L. ABG was pH7.27 pCO233 pO277 HCO316. She was transferred to the MICU given her hemodynamic instability. 
Patient is a 70 year-old male with striatonigral degeneration, history of multiple admissions for hypoxia and respiratory failure who presents with fever. Patient was recently admitted in [**Month (only) **], ([**Date range (1) 16380**]) when he was admitted with hypoxia/respiratory failure. He was found to have a pseudomonal PNA and acute exacerbation of hypoxia at that time was thought to be secondary to thick secretions. He was treated with zosyn x 14 days, vancomycin x 10 days. Initially, the patient required ventilatory support due to hypercarbia but was able to be weaned to trach mask by the end of the second week. Additionally, fluid overload played a component in this. Other things complicating admission were hypernatremia and metabolic alkalosis requiring diamox. Pt was d/cd home on [**2812-5-21**]. Per wife, pt left on the day of discharge at 4 pm. He arrived home and by 8 pm he was spiking a temperature. He has had fevers since then, more noticable in the AM, with the highest morning of admission to 102.5. Because of his continued fevers, and culture sputum results (one of three colonies of pseudomonas came back sensitive to tobra but not to zosyn), a PICC was placed by IR on [**2812-5-24**] as an outpt and he was started on tobramycin IV (360 mg IV q24 hr). He was also started on flagyl PO for diarrhea that resolved. +fatigue; + increased grey secretions this week per wife. Today, PICC line was clogged, the patient was still febrile, and sent to ED per PCP. In the ED, VS on arrival were: T: 100.5; HR: 97; BP: 114/75; RR: 20: 98 on 3L trach mask. He was given flagyl 500 mg IV and levaquin 500 mg IV

This 61-year-old male was admitted to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2984-7-25**] for increased shortness of breath.  He was transferred from [**Hospital3 16459**], where he was admitted for severe shortness of breath.  He was diuresed with Lasix with no change in symptoms at the outside hospital.  Also at the time of his admission to the outside hospital, patient had a two week history of a cough nonproductive with a current chest cold, however, denying any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, or chest pain. Chest x-ray was done at the outside hospital, which revealed bilateral pleural effusions.  EKG was performed, which revealed new T-wave inversions in leads I, aVL, and cardiac enzymes were performed as well showing a small increase in troponin to 0.7 with a CK MB of 10.  The patient was treated in the Emergency Room with Heparin drip, beta blocker, and aspirin, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 186**] for cardiac catheterization. Cardiac catheterization was performed [**2984-7-26**], which revealed left main coronary artery disease and two vessel coronary artery disease.  Patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery.  Reverse saphenous vein graft to the right posterior descending coronary artery, and reverse saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal coronary artery. On [**2984-7-30**], the patient was originally scheduled, however, to have surgery on the [**7-29**], but when the patient was brought to the holding area, the morning of the 10th, he was found to have an oxygen saturation of 85%, appearing short of breath, and was tachypneic.  An EKG was performed at that time which showed slightly worse T-wave inversions laterally.  ABG revealed respiratory acidosis with a large AA gradient, and the patient was postponed for surgery and transferred to the CCU. The evening of [**2984-7-29**], the patient had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed prophylactically.  Patient was transferred to the CSRU after surgery on milrinone 0.4 mcg, 0.1 mcg of Levophed, 0.15 mcg of nitroglycerin, and 20 mcg of propofol. A Renal consult was called on the patient the day of his surgery and their plan was for hemodialysis the following day, and to D/C the patient's intra-aortic balloon pump if the patient remained hemodynamically stable. Postoperative day one, the patient still remained intubated on an insulin drip, a Levophed drip, as well as propofol drip.  With a T max of 101.8 and sinus rhythm with an intra-aortic balloon pump still in place at 1:1.  Patient was sedated due to his anxiety upon waking up at which time he would flail his arms causing his blood pressure to go up. Patient also received small doses of Versed as needed for his increased agitation upon waking.  He had minimal urine output with a BUN of 23 and a creatinine of 5.8, and he was given Tylenol for his fever. His intra-aortic balloon pump was removed that same morning after which the patient received hemodialysis.  A couple minutes into his hemodialysis, SVTs were noted on the monitor with a systolic blood pressure in the 90s.  A crash cart was brought into the room for cardioversion.  The patient rapidly deteriorated into V-tach and around 10:52 that morning, the patient was brought to the operating room.  After several

39 yo female history of HTN, IDDM, NiCMY with EF 45%, nonobstructive CAD, and ESRD s/p HD today heard to release a large yelp with an agonal breath and subsequently found to be unresponsive and pulseless.  There are no strips from HD.  CPR was initiated for three minutes until AED was applied and advised shock with return of spontaneous circulation, a perfusing rhythm, and 100% sat. EMS reports that she was responsive only to painful stimuli, with a GCS of 6.  EKG at that time was reported as NSR 70-80 withuot ectopy and antiarrythmic deferred.  In the ED, she was found to have gurgling breath sounds, poor tone, was not coherent and appeared to be "out of it" so she was intubated with atomidate and vecuronium.  She was started on 150mg IV amio bolus with drip at 1mg/minute.  She was sedated with propofol.  She was hypertensive at 170's/100's, with multiple runs of PVC's including 10 run beats of VT.  Her ectopy decreased with amio. After head CT and guaiac were negative, a cooling protocol was initiated with goal temp of 33.  A full strength rectal aspirin was administered.  Blood gas upon admission was 7.43/49/108/34. En route to the CCU, 2mg of Ativan were given for questionable tongue twitching representing seizure activity. . Of note, recently seen at [**Hospital1 2148**] for febrile viral illness for which she was given doses of vanco, levo, and flagyl.  Her potassium at that time was listed as 4.1.  EKG at that time was noted to be NSR at 75, with multiple PVC's and no acute ST-T changes. . In the CCU, she is unable to complete a review of systems or voice her complaints as she is intubated. 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 16482**] is a 39 year old female with a history of HTN, IDDM, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 45% s/p recent hospitalization for VF arrest with ICD placement after arctic sun protcol, nonobstructive CAD, and ESRD on HD who is transferred to the emergency room from her rehabilitation center for a low hematocrit. The patient was recently admitted on [**2951-11-22**] status post cardiac arrest while at dialysis, thought to be secondary to hypokalemia with a presumed R on T phenomenon lead to VT --> VF arrest.  She underwent Arctic sun cooling and re-warming, successful extubation following prior failed attempt (required re-intubation due to mucous plugging), and gradual recovery of her baseline mental status, after frequent work with PT and speech and swallow to resume PO intake. She was dialyzed in-house by the renal team with a high K bath to maintain her K around 5. EP placed a single chamber ICD (despite significant concerns regarding her multiple comorbidities). She had evidence of significant ectopy on telemetry throughout her hospitalization including frequent PVC's and occasional runs of NSVT. She was discharged to rehab for continued recovery of her physical function. . In the ED, initial VS were: 98.2 85 157/73 18 100% 2L.  She received 1 unit pRBCs for a hematocrit of 22.2.  Other labs were notable for a BUN/creatinine of 29/4.4, bicarb of 33, Trop of 0.08 in the setting of CRF, and a hapto <5 with normal bilirubin and slightly elevated LDH at 330.  Most notably, she felt unwell and her glucose returned at 35.  She was given D50 and a repeat fingerstick was 158.  Repeat at 12:15 = 60 and she was given another amp of D50 with re-check at 1:20 = 50.  Another amp was given and she also ate a [**Country 1059**] [**Location (un) 5927**].

59F with multiple medical problems including ESRD s/p failed renal transplant on PD currently, severe AS/moderate MS, GI sarcoma s/p surgery/radiotherapy in [**2528**], HTN, and CAD s/p NSTEMI. Who was admitted from the vascular clinic with a new open area on her right foot noted to be draining "dark fluid" with increased confusion since [**2543-7-6**]. She was a patient at the [**Hospital 5432**] Rehab Hospital. Patient had been complaining of right foot/right great toe pain since [**2542-6-8**] and was previously seen by vascular surgery in [**2543-4-9**] with decreased pulses on the right foot. At that time arterial duplex noted patent bilateral femoropopliteal vessels, SFA stenosis on the left, greater than 50%, poor visualization of the tibial arteries bilaterally and likely bilateral iliac disease. Her vessels were noted to be heavily calcified bilaterally. She was recommended to undergo CTA at that time but refused. Since that time she has had continued pain in her right foot, with severe pain even at rest, but does not know if she has ever had claudication or prior ulcers. She reported that she has seen another vascular surgeon at [**University/College **] this month but he stated that her vessels were "too calcified to do anything." She denied any fever or chills but had some nausea and had one episode of emesis today. 
This is an 81 year old female with past medical history notable for right sided MCA stroke with residual left hemiparesis, COPD, Atrial flutter, and partial gastrectomy for gastric cancer who presented to the ED today with altered mental status as well as weakness this morning.  The patient's daughter reports she had been in her normal state of health two days ago but yesterday seemed more confused and was coughing with an increased O2 requirement.  At that time the patient's daughter spoke to the patient's PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 8395**], who recommended presentation to the ED for evaluation, the patient refused this however and thus stayed at home.  This morning the patient was found in bed unresponsive and not speaking to her daughter.  extremely altered and not responding in her normal way to her daughter. In fact she was barely responding at all and was unable to stand. The patient was brought to the the ED where she was obtunded with nonmoving left arm and hypertonic left leg.  Initial vitals were T 97.9, BP 138/83, P 69, RR 24, 99% on NRB (dropping to 99% on 6L by NC).  Neurology consulted and was concerned this could be a new ischemic stroke but the patient also had findings consistent for pneumonia and some concerning ECG changes with elevated troponins.  Given multiple issues this was considered possible CVA versus return of previous deficits in the context of other acute illness.  Neuro recommended no acute management, case was briefly discussed with cards, who recommended aspirin, and the patient received levofloxacin and cefepime as well as nebs.  She was admitted to floor. . ROS: Unobtainable as patient is unresponsive.

Patient is a 42-year-old female with end-stage renal disease secondary to P-ANCA glomerulonephritis currently getting hemodialysis on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday via right upper extremity AV fistula. She had a previous kidney transplant in [**2694**] which failed approximately 1.5 years posttransplant. She does not void and has high sensitization. 
69 y/o M w/ striatonigral degeneration, nonverbal and minimally communicative, recurrent aspiration w/ tracheostomy with multiple infectious complications including MRSA, VRE, C. Diff, pseudomonas, GERD, diastolic dysfunction, ischemic bowel s/p j tube, recent admit to [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] in [**7-1**] with hypoxia, UTI, who is now being transferred from an outside hospital after being admitted there for acute hypercarbic respiratory failure on [**8-17**]. The patient presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure on [**8-17**] (ABG 6.97/200/105), and this was felt secondary to obstruction of his tracheostomy tube and possibly from his neurological disease. He was also in acute renal failure with hyperkalemia. Patient was admitted to OSH and had bronchoscopy which showed occlusion of the tracheostomy orifice by the posterior membranous trachea. He had 2 trach changes while there but patient still intermittently seemed to occlude the trach and develop high PIPs. This was mostly positional. Patient was at least in part transferred for Other events during this brief OSH hospitalization were a PAC with PCWP 18, PAP 45/26 RAP 18. His initial hematocrit was only 19 but improved and stabilized with 3 units of PRBC (no source found for this blood loss). Patient's stool was also + for C. Diff. His renal failure improved. Patient had low grade fevers with a bld cx that grew 1/2 bottles GPR thought to possibly be a contaminant. He was treated with PO Vanco for C. diff, Cefepime, and flagyl. On transfer to the [**Hospital1 **], patient was found to be hypotensive with MAPs in the low 50s, systolics in the 70s. He improved slightly with 1.9 L of IVF but then declined again and required initiation of Levophed. 
Pt. is a 70 y/o with striatonigral degeneration, J-tube, trach, traceomalacia who initially p/w increased secretions, low-grade temps and increased work of breathing x 10 days. Hx is per wife, who is primary care taker. . Wife reports that sx started ~10 days pta with increased work of breathing and increased secretions- having to suction more frequently. She initially attributed this to allergies, but when it did not improve she became concerned. She noticed that he was requiring more O2 than normal to maintain O2 sats (generally on 2L O2 at night -> increased to 4L, occ requiring 6L at home) and was requiring Nebs more frequently (Q6 -> Q4) Feels he has been lethargic and less interactive than usual. Also reports low grade fevers, Tm 100.3. Wife thinks swelling in legs has gotten worse in past 10 days as well. Pt. started on Levaquin by PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**4-27**], but did not improve with this therapy. . In ED received Vancomycin and Zosyn and A/A Nebs and was admitted to the medicine floor. This AM, while the RN was suctioning the patient, she noted thick, yellow secretions, and then the patient stopped breathing and "turned blue" for a period of several seconds - less than one minute. She called a code, continued to suction, and the patient began to breath again, with improvement in coloration. His O2 saturations rapidly improved to 96%. He was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation/management. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 17057**] has a h/o MI several years ago, w/episode lasting 20 hours on day of admission.  Pt ruled in for NSTEMI. 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 17089**] is a 56 y/o F with a h/o morbid obesity, metabolic syndrome and restrictive lung disease who initially p/w weakness and dehydration.  On admission she was found to be hypoxic by EMS to 78% on RA.  She was also found to have LE cellulitis, a UTI, [**Last Name (un) **] and an elevated BNP and troponin.  She was admitted to the medical floor, where she was started on ceftriaxone for her UTI and vancomycin for her cellulitis.  An echo was done for further evaluation of her hypoxia, which showed a dilated right ventricle and right ventricular volume overload.  Given her echo findings, elevated BNP/troponin the floor team was concerned that she may have a PE so she was empirically started on a heparin gtt as she was unable to get a CTA because of her [**Last Name (un) **] and radiology felt a V/Q scan would not be useful in the setting of her poor baseline CXR. . She initially was stable but with worsening renal function, when on the day of transfer she was found to be somnolent, confused and with an oxygen saturation of 87% on 4LNC.  She was placed on 6LNC with improvement in her oxygen satuartion improved to 92% but she remained tachypneic.  ABG done at that time was 7.22/59/70, she was placed on her nighttime bipap for her respiratory distress.  A CXR was done that was unchanged from prior, she was also noted to be febrile to 102.5 at that time. Given her need for bipap, a transfer to the ICU was initiated. VS on arrival to the ICU were: 100.4, 80, 105/43, 20, 99% on bipap with 6L.  Shortly after her arrival to the ICU she desaturated to the low 80's, at that time we transferred her to NIPPV with settings of [**9-18**] and an FiO2 of 100%, her oxygen saturations improved quickly on the new bipap settings. .

Per MICU note, 
This is an 86 year old man with a history of coronary artery disease, myelodysplastic syndrome, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, who presents with acute onset of midepigastric pain without radiation to his back.  The pain was constant and ten out of ten.  The patient came to the Emergency Department for further evaluation and he had dry heaves but without vomiting.  He denies fever or chills at home.  He has no history of postprandial pain.  No recent changes in his medications. The patient denies chest pain and currently he has no palpitations. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 17610**] is a 49 year old gentleman with DMI, CAD, PVD and ESRD s/p living related donor transplant [**2691**] who initially presented to the ED on [**5-22**] with a two-week history of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and fevers. The pt states that he was in his USOH until approximately two weeks ago when he developed diarrhea, which he describes as loose and watery, non-bloody and without mucous, approximately [**12-31**] BM/day. He has also been having low-grade temps to 100.2 over the past 1-2 weeks with chills. He was started on an empiric trial of ciprofloxacin by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2704-5-18**]. He subsequently developed nausea and bilious emesis over the past 2-3 days with myalgias and increasing fatigue and decreasing po intake. The patient reports a chronic cough for the past 6 months, which is unchanged. Denies HA, neck stiffness, SOB, chest pain, PND, abdominal pain. He does report decreasing UOP for the past [**3-1**] days. He had a dental procedure three weeks ago. In ED, the patient was afebrile with lactate of 1.3. BP was initially 103/57 with HR 82 and glucose of 443 with anion gap of 25. He was given Vanc/Zosyn and started on an insulin gtt. His BP subsequently decreased to 85/44 with HR 87 and he was given hydrocortisone 100mg IV x 1. Anion gap increased to 27 prior to transfer to MICU. In the MICU the patient was managed with fluids and insulin gtt. The cause of his DKA was thought to be either a urinary tract infection or a community acquired pneumonia. He was also noted to have elevated cardiac enzymes and his NSTEMI was thought to be either a precipitant of his DKA or a cuase of his DKA. He continued to have a mixed acid/base disturbance due to persistant diarrhea. He was continued on aspirin and beta blocker for his NSTEMI. He also was noted to have acute renal failure. His [**Last Name (un) **] was held. He was seen by the renal service who felt he had prerenal failure with a urine sodium of 10. Today his insulin gtt was stopped at 7 pm and he received his regular glargine dose. 
Patient is a 51 yo M on chronic prednisone and other immune-suppressants with DM1, renal failure (2 failed transplants, with recent dialysis re-initiation), CHF, HTN, and HL who, following discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2706-6-30**] where he was admitted for acute on chronic renal failure and worsening CHF, re-presented on [**2706-7-1**] to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with bilateral hearing loss, nausea, non-bloody emesis, and fevers/chills x 1 day. Upon arrival to the ED, his vitals were HR 106, BP 112/37, RR 16, o2 sat 95 RA, T 100.9. He was given vancomycin and ceftriaxone and 1L NS bolus. While this improved his BP initially, he was again hypotensive to the 70s shortly thereafter. Pressors were given, and the patient was transferred to the MICU. On arrival to the MICU the patient was stable with a BP in 110. He still endorsed mild hearing loss, but denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, fever, chills, abdominal pain, dysuria, or diarrhea. MICU course: Patient was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis (+ketones in blood), anemic (Hct 20),  and with a low-grade fever. While in the MICU, his ketoacidosis was successfully treated and he was transfused to a Hct 28. Anemia labs were consistent with anemia of chronic disease / chronic kidney disease. A search for a cause of the fevers revealed negative blood cultures, normal chest x-ray, and non-albicans yeast in the urine. He was transferred to the regular medical service. 
HPI: 51 yo M with PMH of CAD s/p CABG, CHF (LVEF=30%+diastolic dysfunction), h/o thromboembolic CVA and on chronic anticoagulation, s/p Right BKA and Left AKA, and ESRD s/p LRRT renal tx in '[**91**] with Stage 5 CKD of allograft, recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] and started back on HD, presents with fever to 102, vomiting x 3. The patient was in his usual state of health until two nights ago, when he noted fever and and nausea with bilious emesis. He admits to a cough over the past several weeks which is nonproductive. He denies diarrhea, constipation, headache, abdominal pain, dysuria, or increased urinary frequency. He has no other complaints at this time. . In the ED, the patients vitals were: T 102.3 up to 104, HR 109, BP 105/99, RR 16, Sat 100% RA. CXR was negative for infiltrate. UA showed WBC of [**5-6**] and RBC of [**1-29**] and pt was started empirically on cefepime and vanc. Labs significant for WBC 22.3 with bandemia and CT abdomen was negative. Initial lactate of 5.3 decreased to 1.5 after hydration. . ROS: As per above, he denies diarrhea, constipation, headache, abdominal pain, dysuria, or increased urinary frequency. . 
This is a 52 year old man with multiple medical problems, including type I diabetes, s/p renal transplant, CAD, and PVD, who called [**Company 189**] today. He tells me that he was feeling very weak and had two bowel movements today, loose, and the typical dark color which he associates with his iron supplementation. Per the [**Company 189**] note he was having diarrhea and fecal incontinence. He denies this to me. He was urged to come in for evaluation and called for an ambulance. When the ambulance arrived, EMS found him to be bradycardic in the 30s, and unresponsive, and EMS transcutaneously paced him in the field to the 60s. When he arrived in the emergency department they got a heart rate in the 60s, RR of 12, and were evidently unable to obtain a blood pressure. He had O2 sats of 93-95% in the first 15 minutes of being in the ED. . In the ED his EKG revealed diffuse ST depression, especially in v4-6; cardiology was consulted and ultimately did not feel that the EKG was significantly different than prior EKGs and was unlikely to represent an ischemic event. He was found to be hyperkalemic and received insulin, glucose, and calcium. With concern for infection he received vancomycin; piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) was also ordered in the ED but it is not clear whether this was actually given by the notes in the ED flow sheet. A central line was placed in the RIJ. An abdominal CT scan (based on elevated LFTs but normal Alk phos by labs as well as complaint of abdominal pain and diarrhea), and a head CT scan were performed; the abdominal CT showed no clear acute abdominal process, though could not use contrast for renal reasons; it did show some stranding around the distal colon and some gallbladder wall edema. The head CT was also negative by initial read although a formal read was not available. A chest x-ray showed atelectasis vs consolidation, while the bottom portion of the abdominal CT also showed effusion and atelectasis as well as an area of possible infectious consolidation. . He had a brief period of hypotension in the ED for which he was put on dopamine; this was turned off before transit to the MICU. In terms of review of systems he denies chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, syncope or pre-syncope; he affirms back pain which he says has worsened since his power wheelchair broke and he can no longer sit properly in it. He denies fevers or sweats; he says he felt cold today; he denies shaking chills. 
52 y/o M s/p renal transplant with extensive medical history notable for CHF EF 20-30%, CAD s/p CABG, DM, and vasculopathy s/p amputations. Was recently hospitalized in [**Month (only) 946**] with extended stay for volume overload and possible infection. Patient was diuresed with subsequent improvement in his symptoms. Now represents with increasing SOB, weight gain, and scrotal swelling since discharge from rehab 1 month ago. Referred to ED for diuresis. . In the ED, initial vital signs were 150/80, HR 70, RR 18, O2 97% RA. Exam was notable for coarse breath sounds, swollen scrotum, +stump edema of LE. Labs notable for renal failure with Cr 4.2, hyperkalemia, and anemia. Patient was given 40mg IV lasix x1, SL NTG x3 and morphine 2mg IV x1, kayexelate 30mg PO x1. Was admitted to the medicine service for management. Renal aware. ECG in ED unconcerning. . On arrival to the floor patient complained of [**7-6**] pain in stumps bilaterally, lower back and scrotum. Otherwise, without complaints. Patient denies recent change to his diet or medications. . Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 17610**] is a 53 y/oM with h/o of ESRD on HD h/o MI and CABG, DM presents with chest pain. Over the last several weeks he has been noticed increased swelling, abdominal girth, and slowly progressive dyspnea on exertion, and has developed orthopnea. He has also developed chest pain that is similar to prior angina; initially this occured with exertion only but awoke him from sleep at 2am. He had associated dyspnea and diaphoresis, but no nausea. He took a sl ntg tablet which relieved the pain, but the pain later occured at rest in the morning that did not respond and he called EMS and presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. He did take his 81mg asa this morning. He is on warfarin for h/o stroke, but was subtherapeutic at 1.6. In the ED, initial VS:  HR 84 BP 80/p. He was hypoxic to the mid 80s on room air. He was given IVF for hypotension, but only about 600-700cc given his EF of 25%. There was difficulty in obtaining IJ access initially, but eventually catheter placement was successful, but probably terminates in the subclavian. His troponin was elevated to 0.72 above his baseline of 0.4, and ECG showed widened QRS and PR prolongation felt to be c/w hyperkalemia. He also had slight worsening of ST depressions laterally. He was given calcium, insulin, and glucose, and admitted to the MICU for CVVH. In the unit, he c/o [**2-4**] chest discomfort, with BP ranging from 80-90/40s initially. Cardiology consultation was obtained. . ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria. 
53 yo M with CAD s/p CABG and PCI (most recently [**8-/2708**]), ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF=15%), DMI, extensive PVD s/p multiple amputations, ESRD on HD presented to the ED after awaking from sleep acutely SOB. Initially with WBC=18, BP=51/19 and HR=90s-130s. After 500cc of IVF, he began complaining of shortness of breath and developed minimal crackles at the bases along with an increasing oxygen requirement, ultimately requiring NRB to maintain sats in the low 90s. Vanco/zosyn was given in the ED and a central line was placed. . On arrival to the floor, pt interviewed with his wife present. [**Name2 (NI) **] was SOB on NRB with O2 sat ranging 85-100% with variable pleth.  He denied preceding fevers, chills, diaphoresis.  He had noted a dry cough for some days leading up to this, but the onset of SOB was sudden & severe; it awoke him from sleep. Per his wife, his leg ulcers have been healing well. Pt has had recurrent ESBL Klebiella UTIs which continue to be a problem. [**Name (NI) **] also has an infected molar which was scheduled to be removed this week and for which he has been taking penicillin. . He was weaned to 50% FIO2 on arrival with BP 60/34 (systolic confirmed by doppler). CVP was 8 (pt does have 2+ TR and PA HTN). Telemetry/EKGS notable for AFIB with rate ranging 90-[**Street Address(2) 17719**] depressions across the precordium. At that time, pt complaining of lightheadedness and diffuse weakness; denying chest pain.  He was given 500cc over 30min with good response in his BP to 70s/40s. He stated that he felt less weak. CVP~12 after the first 500cc given on the floor. After another 250cc, pt became acutely unresonsive & cyanotic for 30 seconds. O2 sat failed to register initially and then returned at 60% with poor pleth--no better on ears, fingers, forehead. He was intubated by anethesia and good pleth obtained on the nose, sat 90s post-intubation.  A-line could not be placed for more accurate monitoring during these events as his only palpable artery is the femoral in his left stump & INR=3. . After intubation, pt's non-invasive BP=116/38 with HR~100 (afib) and CVP 14-18. . ROS: Denied fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, hematuria.  Endorsed some mild bladder discomfort, still produces minimal urine daily. 
Presented intubated to ED for shortness of breath. 
76 y/o with PMH significant for HTN, CAD, DM, dementia(baseline A +O x 3, w/ expressive dysphasia [**1-4**] to CVA), [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 911**] [**Male First Name (un) 1276**], L MCA stroke, CHF and other medical problems who presents with w/ two days of right facial twitching, one day of increased drooling (noted at dinner time today), and worsening of normally mild right facial droop and slurred speech while at her nursing home. The nurse noted a concerned look on her face, though she remained alert and aware of the situation. Her words were also unclear. The nurse at the nursing facility called EMS. . Of note, she also experience increased shortness of breath over the past week. This was felt to be CHF. At [**Hospital1 5521**], her MD started to diurese her w/ lasix. Her wt improved from 266 to 253 over the week. Denies CP or n/v/d. 
76 F with PMH HTN, CAD, DM, dementia (baseline A&Ox3 with expressive aphasia [**1-4**] to L MCA CVA), [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 911**] [**Male First Name (un) 1276**], CHF, presents for elevated BUN/Cr and assessment for need for emergent dialysis. Pt had enterobacter and pseudomonas pneumonia at [**Hospital 99**] Rehab. Pseudomonas was only susceptible to aminoglycosides, so pt was started on gentamicin and cefepime on [**3-9**].  Her Cr started to rise, so gent was d/ced [**3-16**]. After gent was d/ced, pt was maintained on cefepime, but BUN and Cr continued to rise. On [**3-20**], labs from [**Hospital **] Rehab showed her Cr was 3.7 and BUN was 180. Pt's baseline Cr 1.5, baseline BUN 30-50. She arrived from [**Hospital 99**] Rehab on Cefepime, that was started on [**3-16**]?. . Pt was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3353-1-5**], and had been in ARF at that time. Cr had elevated from baseline 1.5 to 1.9. Etiology was attributed to being dehydrated on chronic DM, HTN. Renal was consulted at the time, and recommended weeklong course of CVVH, but no longterm hemodialysis, because of the grim prognosis for the patient at the time. She was discharged at that time on Lasix and metolazone for continued diuresis. She was admitted to [**Hospital 99**] Rehab in acute on CRF, with Cr of 2.0 on admission. Etiology was attributed to sepsis, hypotension with low renal perfusion, CHF exacerbation. At [**Hospital 99**] Rehab, pt underwent weeklong course of HD. . Pt had a foley placed at [**Hospital 99**] Rehab, but she had a UTI, and it was kept out. She was apparently incontinent and produced a good volume of urine per day (she was never anuric). Baseline BP has been 100-110. Pt was transferred on vent (IMV RR 9 with PS 18) and HD stable. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for dialysis catheter placement and to be assessed for need for emergent dialysis for elevated BUN and Cr.

The patient was given 80 mg of Lasix intravenous with 600 cc of urine output and improved shortness of breath subsequently to this.  On electrocardiogram new onset atrial fibrillation in the 90s. The patient was in normal sinus rhythm as recently as [**2828-9-21**] while on the Holter monitor. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 17803**] is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, two vessel disease as shown on cardiac catheterization in [**2866-2-24**], also with an echo showing ejection fraction of 15 to 20% in [**2866-2-24**] and severe mitral regurgitation. Patient was brought in by his family who founded status post syncope at home.  Patient recovered consciousness spontaneously at home.  His blood pressure was checked and it was found to be in the low 80s.  Patient relates that he has been very fatigued, unable to move his legs or even hold up his head because of his weakness for the past two to three weeks.  They also complain of a decreased appetite for the same length of time. The patient was hospitalized at [**Hospital6 **] for the same complaints three weeks prior to his admission to [**Hospital1 69**].  The patient reports that during that hospitalization, his pacer was adjusted, however they relayed that they did not notice any improvement since he was discharged.  They also complained that since discharge, his systolic blood pressure which they check at home every day has persistently been less than 90. In the Emergency Department of [**Hospital1 186**] the patient initially presented with a blood pressure of 102/40 and a heart rate of 60.  He then became hypotensive with the lowest blood pressure being 68/37.  He then became unresponsive and he was noticed to have seizure activity and a short time of apnea which prompted intubation for airway protection.  He was then started on Dopamine and received IV fluids for a total of 2.5 liters.

Also noted to have ARF, which was attributed to hypotension, and improved. Recent clinic notes from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] detail similar presentation of weakness.  He has had several medication changes recently, including his amiodarone and digoxin dosing.  His amiodarone was originally discontinued following recent VT ablation,though was subsequently restarted at 800 mg daily. Following reinitation, he noted weakness and blurred vision. His amiodarone was again d/c'd [**2870-12-24**].  In addition, his digoxin was d/c'd at 12/29, to see whether his symptoms improved without it.  Per the patient's daughter, his symptoms initially improved somewhat, though overall have not changed significantly. Per family members, he has been intermittently confused, and has had bowel incontinence on several occasions. ROS negative for HA, melena, BRBPR, abdominal pain.  Has had intermittent nausea. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with a splenic laceration and multiple rib fractures.  He fell at home  on [**2908-12-1**] and on [**2908-12-2**] was taken to the ER as his blood sugar was 560 and he was hypotensive. Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] lives at home with his son who takes care of him 24/7.  Upon further investigation his hematocrit was 25 and he received 1 unit of packed red blood cells.  His stool guiac was negative and he subsequently underwent CT of abd and pelvis which showed a splenic laceration and fractures of left ribs [**10-19**].  There was also some free fluid in the pelvis prompting transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 1942**] is a 56-year-old gentleman with known coronary artery disease and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, who had been previously admitted in [**3104-4-17**] with chest pain, congestive heart failure and ruled out for myocardial infarction at that time, but had a positive exercise tolerance test and was brought to cardiac catheterization during that admission.  At that time his catheterization showed normal left main, left anterior descending coronary artery 95% occluded, circumflex coronary artery 70% occluded, obtuse marginal #1 70% occluded, right coronary artery 70% occluded, no left ventriculogram was done at that time due to an elevated creatinine, however his ejection fraction by echocardiogram at that time was 40-45%. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 17833**] is an 88 year old man with a history of interal hemorrhoids, myelodysplasia with chronic anemia and thrombocytpenia, and  A fib. on coumadin who presents after being sent to ED by PCP to be transfused for Hct of 25 on routine weekly INR checks. Pt recalls "feeling tired" over the past week and noticing bright red blood on this toilet paper after bowel mov'ts for the past wk. Admits to constipation, straining, ? tenesmus over past wk. Denies abdominal pain, diarrhea, change in color of stools?, melena, chest pain, SOB. Last colonscopy was 3 yrs ago, polyps on past studies.

EKG 64 atrial fibrillation nl axis ST depressions (1mm) V3-V6, TWI V4-V6, prolonged QTc. Compared to prior EKG, ST depressions in same leads slight more depressed on this more current EKG. 
89yoM with h/o CAD s/p 4vCABG, COPD on 2L home O2, CHF (EF 35%), Afib on coumadin, Parkinson's disease, myelodysplastic syndrome with anemia and thrombocytopenia, transferred from OSH with left hip fracture. History obtained from the patient and his daughter. The patient lives alone in an apartment downstairs from his daugther who helps with all ADLs. He walks with a walker. While alone in his apartment, he fell while walking backward from the kitchen with his walker. He called lifeline and was brought to [**Hospital3 1181**]. He reports hitting his head but no LOC. Head CT negative for hemorrhage at [**Hospital1 **]. C-spine cleared. . Per the patient's daughter, over the past week he has been somewhat short of breath. His weight was 170lbs, up from his dry weight of 160lbs. He normally does not wear his home O2 frequently but did so this past week. He was also found to be in ARF with creatinine elevated at 2.8 last week. His lasix dose was increased, and at the OSH today his creatinine was 2.5 (baseline 1.5-1.7). He sleeps with his head elevated in a hospital bed; denies PND. . Pt underwent L hemiarthoplasty of the hip for a L femoral head fx. Pt unable to wean from vent in PACU. Admitted to MICU for VAP, hypotension (briefly on levophed) and ATN thought to be [**2-19**] hypotension. Pt placed on lasix gtt with good u/o to this. Now continues to have altered MS but improved improved creat and treatment of presumed infection. 
Pt is a 68yo caucasian male who presented with c/o worsening shortness of breath limiting activities, and chest discomfort at rest. PMHx significant for Hodgkins disease treated with high dose radiation to the chest in the [**2502**]'s, CAD s/p CABG and redo, severe aortic stenosis,PPM, DM, lupus. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**6-27**], underwent cardiac cath, was found to have 80%LCX stenosis and was treated with bare metal stent. His echo confirmed severe aortic stenosis, [**Location (un) 108**] 1.0cm2, mean gradient 45mmHG, peak velocity 4.3mm/sec. Mr [**Known patient lastname **] reports he has noted SOB over the past year, however significantly worsening over the past few weeks. He was walking 1.5 miles daily, now limited due to near syncopal episodes. He was experiencing chest pain daily prior to his last intervention. He feels his worsening shortness of breath is severely limiting his ADLs and is seeking aortic valve treatment options. Patient reports no admissions since last seen. No medication changes. Noticing decline in functional status, now only able to ambulate about 75 feet prior to experiencing blurred vision, lightheadedness. 
The patient is a 69 year old man with a history of hypertension and seizure disorder who was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and hypotension.  He was in his usual state of good health until two days prior to admission when he had the onset of vertigo.  Since then, he increasing lethargy.  On the day of admission, he suffered a syncopal episode which he recalls occurred after vomiting. He says this was unlike his seizure episodes.  He denies head trauma or loss of consciousness.  He also denies fever, chills, cough, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, hematuria, hematochezia and melena. evaluation.  There he was afebrile and hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s.  After three liters of isotonic intravenous fluids, his blood pressure remained in the 70s with a heart rate in the 80s to 90s.  A nasogastric tube was placed and lavage was trace positive for blood.  An electrocardiogram was obtained which showed a new right bundle branch block.  The patient's oxygen saturations were in the 80s in room air but increased to mid 90s on four liters nasal cannula oxygen. 
74yo man with history of COPD presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with history of increasing dyspnea, cough with no fevers or chills for several days. He had been seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 5688**] a few days prior to admission with similar complaints.  He had also been having productive cough with green sputum. He had denied any fevers, chills, nausea/vomiting, chest pain.  There was not clear orthopnea, PND, or increased lower extremity edema. . Initial vitals of 98.9, 136, 144/77, 36, 89% on 100% NRB. On exam, he was in respiratory distress, tachypneic to 30's, tachycardic, and saturating only 89% on 100% NRB mask. His chest xray demonstrated bilateral infiltrates (official read as pulmonary edema), and he was intubated for respiratory failure. Intubation done with succ/etomidate. He was given bolus of fentanyl and versed for sedation. His initial abg after intubation was 7.29/64/179 -> then 7.31/40/71. . In ED, he was given 10mg decadron, ceftriaxone 1g, levaquin 500mg, 3L in total of NS, had two 18g peripheral IVs placed, and received fentanyl and versed.  He was also noted to have asymmetric lower extremity swelling with right > left. A lower extremity doppler ultrasound demonstrated an extensive right DVT from the superficial femoral vein down to the popliteal vein. He was started on heparin IV. 
77 yo M h/o CHF, afib p/w progressive shortness of breath and worsening lower extremity edema worse on left than right x 1 week. He states he was quite active with symptoms until he climbed up Edinburgh castle in [**Country 17853**]. He admits to two pillows when he sleeps, but has to increase it to three pillows for the last few days, no PND.  He also complained of substernal, dull, non-radiating chest discomfort that started when he was in [**Country 17853**]. He states had this feeling since his CABG many years ago. He has not taken NTG. Nothing makes the pain better/worse. It is non-pleuritic.  He admits to one tablespoon hemoptysis (dark brown chocolate color) daily for the past two days. He flew back from [**Country 17853**] two days PTA. In ED VS were HR: 118-129 in afib BP: 128/84 22 96% RA. Was given 10 mg IV diltiazem x 3 and 30 mg po diltiazem. Given ASA 325. INR was 6.7 and given 10 mg IV vitamin K and 1 unit of FFP. Tmax: 100.8. CXR showed focal infiltrate in the left mid lung zone as well as cardiomegaly. CT showed no PE, however did show extensive consolidation involving the left upper lobe which may be concerning for pulmonary hemorrhage given the elevated INR. He was also started on 750 mg levofloxacin for presumed PNA. Labs also notable for elevated LFTs, which is new for the patient. Also given 40 IV lasix. Upon arrival to the unit, patient complained of chest discomfort. EKG was afib at rates in 110s. N/S ST/T changes. He was given sl NTG with complete relief of his chest pain. Admits to chills, no fevers. Denies abdominal pain. Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias. 
77 y/o M with h/o CHF (EF= 40-45% on ECHO [**7-/3347**]), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin presented to [**Hospital1 18**] as transfer from [**Hospital6 4949**] in [**Location (un) 7570**], MA for further management of hypoxia due to left upper lobe pneumonia and and ongoing delirium due to previous aspiration pneumonia (right middle lobe). The patient's current history starts [**3347-10-10**], when he was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] (requiring a brief ICU stay) for left upper lobe pneumonia, treated with levofloxacin X7 day course. He was discharged home with [**Hospital1 265**], but around [**10-20**] he started having hypoxia (resting O2sat of 95%, ambulatory O2sat of 85%), and also had cloudy urine. He was treated with Ciprofloxacin X2-3 days for UTI, but because his hypoxia persisted and he had progressively worse dyspnea, he was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**10-22**]. A new right middle lobe infiltrate was noted on CXR during that admission, which was felt to be an aspiration pneumonia. Patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow who felt he had silent aspirations. He was treated with an 8 day course of broad antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn) which ended on [**3347-10-30**]. He was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] on the 20th, but on the 21st he was sent to the [**Hospital6 4949**] because his O2 sats were down in the 80s. At the OSH, a CT chest was performed that showed bilateral pulmonary fibrosis with brochiectasic changes and a small acute infiltrate in the left upper lobe. Patient received 4 days of levofloxacin IV. On the 24th, the patient and his family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of his treatment because this is where he gets the majority of his treatment. . Of note, the CTA chest from [**10-10**] states: "Extensive consolidation involving the left upper lobe, could represent infection. However, given the clinical history of elevated INR, hemoptysis, and lack of symptoms of pneumonia, this could represent pulmonary hemorrhage." . Also, since the patient's discharge from first admission, on [**10-15**] there has been concerns regarding ongoing altered mental status. For a while, the patient's wife had to have friends take turns supervising him at home when she was out. Geriatrics was involved during the patient's last [**Hospital1 18**] admission for difficult to manage delirium which was felt somewhat more consistent with that of acute brain injury. Psychiatry at [**Hospital6 4949**] saw the patient during his current admission and felt he was delirious from ongoing hypoxia, and pulmonary disease. Prior to his presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**10-10**], the patient had been functional and travelling through [**Country 17853**] where he climbed up to Edinburgh Castle. . Upon transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was stable. When interviewed, however, he was alert and oriented X2 but not making much sense in his answers. When asked about his symptoms, he would talk about his coming from [**Location (un) **] many years ago. He did endorse trouble breathing and anxiety. The RN noted he coughed up mucous with blood. . Review of systems: Difficult to get an accurate ROS as patient's responses do not make sense. 
This 73 year-old female with insulin dependent diabetes and inferior MI in [**2833**] presented with chest pain, jaw pain and diaphoresis the morning of admission. . This lasted about 30 minutes and resolved with a SL NTG. She visited Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 993**], her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was sent to the ED. Of note, her presentation during her IMI 12 years ago was similar. Per review of chart, she does have occasional lower chest/epigastric pain which is relieved by SL NTG or TUMS; this has been thought not to be consistent with angina. In the ED, T was 97.6, BP 144/(no diastolic recorded), HR 72, RR 20, 100% RA. She was pain-free but did complain of malaise and mild nausea. By report, EKG was concerning for isolated ST elevation in lead III. Labs were significant for hematocrit 35.6, creatinine 1.5 (baseline ), Troponin of 0.60. She was taken directly to cardiac catherization and found to have three vessel disease with LMCA 70%, mid-LAD 90%, proximal LCx 90%, mid-RCA 90%, distal RCA 90% stenoses. No stents were placed and patient was referred for CABG. 
60-year-old man with end-stage renal disease secondary to hypertension and diabetes. He was on dialysis for approximately 7 months with a right IJ PermCath.  His hypertension and diabetes has been complicated by nephropathy, and coronary artery disease, for which he underwent cardiac bypass in [**3106-5-18**].  He also has had AICD placed.  He underwent percutaneous intervention in the spring of [**3107**] and was recently diagnosed with atrial flutter prior to his scheduled transplant in [**3108-3-17**]. The kidney transplant was subsequently postponed after he underwent ablation of the arrhythmia site and required anticoagulation postoperatively.  [**Known patient firstname **] also notes lower extremity claudication of about 1 to 2 blocks.  His pretransplant workup encouraged a stress test that was unremarkable.  He underwent a cardiac echo that demonstrated an EF of 30 to 40% with 2+ mitral regurgitation.  Colonoscopy was performed in [**3107-12-19**] that demonstrated only benign adenomas.  He underwent pulmonary function tests in [**3108-4-17**] that demonstrated significantly reduced lung volumes, which are essentially unchanged from those performed in [**3103**].  He underwent lower extremity Dopplers noninvasive studies in [**3107-7-19**] that demonstrated noncompressible muscles bilaterally.  He had a marked decrease in his ankle brachial index with exercise.  The interpretation was severe peripheral vascular disease worsened by ambulation. Following these pre-operative tests, a decision was made to proceed with surgery and he was admitted on [**3108-6-23**] to undergo kidney transplant. 
57yo gentleman with h/o CAD s/p 2 MIs, renal transplant [**6-/3002**] for Wegener's granulomatosis, HTN, dyslipidemia, and paroxysmal AFib p/w accelerating angina. He c/o pain in his jaw, which then moves to his throat and then the middle of his chest; feels like pressure. Symptoms are provoked by activity and associated with dyspnea. Patient states that symptoms began a few months ago and have been worsening in the sense that they come on with less stimulus (now just with walking across the room) and only resolve with nitro. He also reports feeling exhausted. He has had a cough productive of large amounts of white sputum x 1 week. +sinus congestion, which he reports feeling like it is dripping down the back of his throat and collecting in his lungs. He also notes subjective fevers at home and nausea with episode of non-bloody emesis in the ED. He has had diarrhea about 5 times a day, "like minestrone soup." He denies sore throat, abdominal pain, or dysuria, and he only gets headaches when he takes the nitroglycerin. Of note, he does endorse PND and orthopnea as well as ankle edema. He reports 10 pounds of weight gain in the last week. . In the ED, his VS were 100.7, Tmax 102 89 120/68 18 97% RA. He was given ASA 325mg and Tylenol 650mg as well as Metoprolol 5mg IV. Levaquin 750mg po was administered at 16:00 for concern of pneumonia. EKG showed ST depression in V4-V6 as well as I and aVL and upsloping ST elevation in V1 and V2. Troponin was 0.27 (last Trop 0.04 in [**11-23**]). Patient was evaluated by the cardiology fellow, and a heparin gtt was ordered, but not started per nursing notes. Patient was also seen by transplant nephrology fellow. 
This is a 57 yo M w/extensive h/o CAD s/p multiple PCI last cath [**8-25**] with 60-70% ostial LAD, mod diffuse left circ, 60% prox RCA medically managed recently admitted for A.fib, PNA requiring intubation who presents with chest pain x 1 1/2h. Pt reports that [**3-22**] x over the past couple of wks he has awoken from sleep w/anginal pain which he describes as starting w/upper jaw and teeth tingling sometimes radiating to throat and shoulders/arms BL. He reports that when it is very severe it also radiates to substernal chest. He notes that prior to last night, the angina lasted several minutes resolving w/2-nitro radiating only to his throat, not to shoulders/arms/chest. He reports that last night ~11pm he awoke w/the anginal pain. He took 4nitro at home w/improvement but no resolution of pain. It was associated w/nausea which was especially concerning to pt b/c he usually does not have associated sx. He called the ambulance and was brought to OSH where his pain was [**10-28**]. At the OSH, vitals upon presentation to OSH ED were BP 154/77 HR 55 sat98%RA. Troponin I at OSH was 0.14(nl 0-0.3), EKG was unchanged from baseline dated [**2999-5-26**]. He received 1 sl ntiro and Heparin IV per weight based protocol was started; pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further w/u. He notes that the CP resolved en route here after he received morphine IV. He has been CP free since. He notes that at baseline he is able to climb a flight of stairs w/o CP or SOB. If he climbs 2 flights(which he has at home) he does get some SOB, but does not have anginal pain. SOB resolves w/rest. He has only had his anginal pain while asleep. He reports that he has otherwise felt well since discharge from his prior admission. He does note fatigue but no f/c, no LE edema, +intermittent palps which are his baseline, no orthopnea/PND. . At [**Hospital1 18**], pt's vitals were stable. EKG showed 0.5mm ST depressions V2-V6, troponins came back at his baseline. He received ASA and Heparin IV was continued. Cardiology was notified. Pt has been chest pain free since arrival. On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. Cardiac review of systems is as in HPI syncope or presyncope. 
This is a 57 year old man, with a past medical history of CABG and PFO closure in [**1-25**], s/p renal transplant secondary to wegeners vasculitis, who was transferred from an outside hospital for an inferior myocardial infarction.  Pt was having chest pain and an electrocardiogram showed ST segment changes in the inferior leads which was consistent with an inferior MI. Patinet underwent cardiac catheterization ([**3003-8-14**]) with stenting for an inferior MI. He had some vagal symptoms towards the end of the procedure and was treated with zophrin and atropine.  Pt was then transerred to the CCU. 
60 M w/ ESRD [**2-19**] Wegener's granulomatosis s/p kidney transplant ([**5-/3002**]) on tacro/cellcept, severe CAD s/p five-vessel CABG with PFO closure [**1-/3003**] and s/p multiple previous PCIs (most recently in [**3-26**]), sCHF (EF=35%), COPD, PAF, HTN, HLD p/w cough productive of whitish sputum, sinus tightness, and muscle pain. He was recently discharged [**3006-2-16**] after a 3-day stay for evaluation of dyspnea and productive cough when he was found to have positive Influenza A DFA and was treated w/ 5 day course of osetalmavir. . In the ED VS: , exam was notable for elevated JVD, tachypnea and bibiasilar rales. He required 4L O2 and SaO2 was 93%. CXR revealed a new retrocardiac opacity and labs were notable for a leukocytosis to 15 and BNP of 30,000. O2 was increased to 6L and pt was satting 93%. He had a BNP of 30,000 (double what it was last month) and was given 20mg IV lasix with 500cc UOP. He was empirically tx w/ vanc/levo for PNA per CXR. He was also found to be in AF w/ rate in 100s, as high as 120s, so was given 25 mg metoprolol. He was also given IV potassium for a K=2.9. . In the ED, initial VS: 100 110 118/76 20 93% 4L . In the ICU, pt states his breathing is very difficult, and feels like when he had flu, except doesn't have the same fatigue/myalgias he had at that time. Also endorses diarrhea (nonbloody, nonmelenotic) 4x/day. . Denies CP, palpitations, lower extremity edema or orthopena. Has not increased pillows (baseline 2).

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5775**] is a 61 year old gentleman with a history of systolic congestive heart failure, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, coronary artery disease s/p multiple angioplasties with recurrent in-stent restenoses, s/p coronary artery bypass grafting and patent foramen ovale closure in [**3003-1-24**], recurrent atrial fibrillation s/p atrioventricular nodal ablation and permanent pacemaker, hypertension, Wegener's granulomatosis, chronic kidney disea s/p renal transplant and prior stroke, who presented with shortness of breath.  For the past two days, the patient has been experiencing progressively worsening shortness of breath, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea, along with increasing abdominal girth and weight gain of four pounds.  Of note, he ran out of his daily Lasix 100 mg prescription, which he receives by mail order, so he was only able to take 50mg on [**10-13**] and nothing on [**10-14**].  He believes that his difficulty breathing began at the time of taking the decreaed dose of Lasix.  He saw his cardiologist, Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 3680**] in clinic on Friday [**10-10**], at which time his weight was 181.5 pounds and he noted dyspnea on exertion of one flight of stairs. Friday [**10-10**] was also his birthday, and the patient thinks that he may have taken in a bit more fluid that day than usual.  He was formerly evaluated by Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 3680**] on [**3006-8-14**] for biventricularpacemaker placement, but the left ventricular lead was unable to be placed; the patient subsequently underwent atrioventicular nodal ablation with a ventricular lead placed on the right ventricular apex.  Afterwards, from [**Date range (1) 17897**], he was readmitted with congestive heart failure exacerbation but improved with adjustment of his diuretics. 
[**Age over 90 **] yo woman with past history of Hypertension and urinary incontinence presents with syncope and bradycardia. Per report patient was recieving physical therapy when she became diaphoretic and unresponsive.  Physical therapist took patient's BP which was 70s/?? with a pulse in the 30s.  EMS was called and patient's BP was 70-80s/40s with a pulse of 30-40 BPM.  Patient was given atropine with no change in pulse. Upon arrival to the ED patient was AOx3 and mentating well, but was persistantly hypotensive to the 70s systolic with pulses in the 30s.  Patient was given calcium and glucagon without response as well as 1 L of fluid with no change in her systolic pressures.  Patient was then started on dopamine drip at 20 mg/min with no change in her systolics.   EKG showed a junctional rhythm. Upon arrival to the CCU patient was 78/39 HR 49, mentating normally.  She denied any dizziness, SOB or chest pain.  Denied any exposure to ticks or new rashes in the preceeding weeks. . On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. 
The patient is an extremely poor historian, however, from what was able to be ascertained, the patient was a 67 year old male with multiple medical problems who presents from the nursing home with abdominal pain. 
[**Age over 90 **] y.o. female, resident at [**Hospital3 2520**] with PMHx significant for multiple abdominal surgeries, including Billroth 2 revised with conversion to Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy for PUD and subtotal colectomy with ostomy for perforated bowel as well as CAD s/p CABG in '[**70**] with patent grafts in '[**78**], atrial fibrillation, HTN, hypothyroidism who presents with a chief complaint of RLQ abdominal pain since last night. Patient has chronic abdominal pain, usually occuring after meals, thought to be an anginal equivalent - often responding to SL nitro. She is reported to have suddenly grabbed the RLQ of her abdomen lastnight complaining of pain. She later had an episode of "coffee-ground" emesis that was reportedly gastrocult negative. Her ostomy output has not been melanic or with gross blood. She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, increased ostomy output, dysuria or hematuria. She was brought in to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER for further evaluation. . In the ED, vitals were T - 99.6, HR - 90, BP - 138/82, RR - 24, O2 - 94% (unclear if on room air). She later spiked to 103.6 and was increased to 4 liters O2 with 96% saturation. Blood cultures and UA/UCx were drawn with UA strongly positive for UTI. CXR also showed perihilar opacities concerning for PNA and patient was empirically started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl. The abdominal pain was evaluated with a CT abdomen, which was initially concerning for an obstruction as minimal contrast was seen at the patient's colostomy. A subsequent KUB then showed sufficient contrast through to the colostomy site, which along with an unremarkable surgical evaluation was ressuring for the absence of a bowel obstruction. EKG showed new STD in the lateral leads and patient was given ASA. Her blood pressure was tenuous so she was not given a beta-blocker. CEs were sent off and the patient was admitted to medicine for further work-up. ROS: Only remarkable for that mentioned above. Per report from [**Hospital3 2520**] nurse, patient received her influenza vaccine on [**3181-11-12**] and her Pneumovax on [**3179-11-8**]. . On admission to the ICU after being in the ED for 22 hours, she was feeling well with no real complaints. She did note that her abdomen was mildly tender diffusely with palpation, but denied dizziness, cp, sob, nausea, vomiting. Her initial vs on admission to the ICU were, T 97, BP 142/52, R 18, O2 95% 4 L NC, HR 72. 
This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with a history of CVA, baseline swallowing difficulties. She was apparently in her USOH at her long term care facility at 4pm when her son visited her. She had a recent diagnosis of progressing pulmonary fibrosis. She was found to be hypoxic to 79%on 3L NC and presented to [**Hospital1 **] where she was found to be hypotensive to 80/48 and remained hypoxic at 82% on NRB with respiratory distress. She was intubated and started on dopamine peripherally for hypotension. She was given zosyn/flagyl and 2L IVF and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Prior to transfer she was made DNR for the ambulance ride, and thereafter. . In the ED, initial vs were: 99.6 130 119/51 99% on vent. CXR with bilateral patchy infiltrates and question of PNA, pleural effusions, concern for aspiration. Vancomycin added here.

This is a 73 year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and atrial fibrillation who complains of a five day history of a cough productive of white sputum.  She reports that yesterday she developed increasing shortness of breath (gradual) along with subjective fevers with chills and sweats.  The patient therefore called EMS. She states that she returned from a vacation in the Catskills approximately one week prior to admission and had a sore throat that subsequently resolved. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for chest pain, shortness of breath, emesis, diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum or melena.  She reports recent nausea with dry heaves.  She has had chronic leg pain and edema (secondary to venostasis and peripheral neuropathy), but denies increase above baseline. The patient denies orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She does report some palpitations and racing heart.  EMS gave the patient a Lasix dose times one and sublingual nitroglycerin times three and brought the patient to the [**Hospital1 1426**] Emergency Department. In the Emergency Department her temperature was 100.0.  Heart rate 100 to 117.  Blood pressure 160/110.  Her oxygen saturation was 85% on room air, which increased to 95% on a 100% nonrebreather.  The patient's electrocardiogram showed minimal lateral nonspecific ST changes.  Her chest x-ray (after the Lasix dose) showed no congestive heart failure, pneumothorax or pneumonia.  An arterial blood gas done on 100% nonrebreather was 7.49, PCO2 of 37, and PO2 of 75. Significant examination findings in the Emergency Department included bibasilar crackles, jugulovenous distention and peripheral edema.  With the patient's history of deep venous thrombosis and PE there was a concern for pulmonary embolus. The CT angiogram was performed, which was negative for pulmonary emboli or for any pulmonary parenchymal process. The patient was then transferred to the MICU due to her elevated oxygen requirement. On arrival to the MICU the patient reported feeling much better.  Her oxygen saturations were in the mid 90s on 6 liters nasal cannula. 
A 73 year old female with diastolic dysfunction, chronic prednisone for rheumatoid arthritis, who presents with four weeks of loose, watery diarrhea.  She was found to be febrile to 100.5 and was also found to be confused and lethargic at home by family members. She was then brought to the ED, where initial evaluation reveals a temperature of 100.1 and hypotension with systolic blood pressure in the 60s.  She received 5 liters of IV fluid which improved the blood pressure to the 90s.  Subsequent to this the patient desaturated to 89 percent on room air and was placed on 100 percent non-rebreather, which improved saturation to 98 percent.  Initial laboratory results revealed a lactate of 4, white blood cell count of 22.  She was, therefore, enrolled in the sepsis protocol.  She had a central line placed and aggressive IV hydration was initiated.  The patient was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. 
This is a 77-year-old female that presented to the emergency room on [**2736-11-18**] with right foot ulcers over the dorsum of her foot and heel with associated fevers. The patient, of note, had had a recent right total hip replacement and total knee replacement and had suffered a severely comminuted segmental femur fracture that was periprosthetic in nature in [**Month (only) 213**] of this year. This had been repaired with open reduction and internal fixation of the right femur, and she also had had a traction pin during this time. Now these ulcers were in the area of this traction pin, and she had noticed that over the last 2-3 days prior to her presentation, she had also experienced some chills.

She had presented to the ED with several weeks of nausea/vomiting/diarrhea; she was found to be in acute renal failure with Cr 6.7, which was treated with IV fluid boluses; she was treated for symptomatic bradycardia with atropine, calcium gluconate, and glucagon. Bradycardia was thought to be [**2-7**] decreased clearance of nodal agents, and they were held, with improvement of bradycardia. Hypotension was attributed to dehydration, Cr improved with fluids.  Nausea/Vomiting was attributed to ARF, which improved with improved hydration, and patient was able to tolerate solid fluids evening before transfer to floor. On interview, patient reported she was feeling well and denied any complaints of difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, chest pain, or nausea/vomiting. Patient did report lethargy. 
HPI: Please refer to nightfloat note.  In brief, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 11972**] is an 83 year-old patient with a known history of COPD, asthma, and hypertension admitted for multiple COPD flares this year.  She presents now with two days of cough and greatly exacerbated shortness of breath.  She reports that her symptoms began roughly two weeks ago, when she developed rhinorrhea.  At this time however, she felt that her asthma/COPD was at baseline. Despite Claritin and Mucinex, her runny nose continued and she began to develop a progressive worsening of her chronic SOB. Ms. [**Known patient lastname 11972**] noted an acute change two days prior to admission, when she could no longer walk to the bathroom without stopping to catch her breath and developed a new cough.  Note that during the course of her illness, the patient never developed any fevers or chills.  Patient did report developing white sputum and said that she had trouble sleeping flat, but she has had 3 pillow orthopnea for years.  No PND.  Otherwise no chest pressure, pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope or pleuritic chest pain.  No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.  On [**5-30**] - the day of admission - the patient reported airway narrowing reminiscent of her previous asthma flares and unresponsive to her nebulizer treatment.  At this point in time she called the paramedics and was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. . In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient's vital signs were T=97.9, P=96, BP=209/79, RR=26, and O2 Sat of 100% RA.  CXR performed and showed no pulmonary edema.  Patient's SOB improved with nebulizers.  She improved with nebs. She received combivent, prednisone 60mg, mag, azithro 500mg, asa 325mg, nitro paste x1inch. Her repeat BP was 193/60 and 98% on 2.5LNC.  At this point she was transfered up to the floor, where she continues to remain comfortable. . ROS otherwise negative in detail except for foreign body sensation in right eye.  Patient attributes this to her trigeminal neuralgia but does grade the pain as [**10-15**].  Notably no headaches, visual changes, as might be expected with hypertension. 
Ms. [**Known patient firstname 2847**] [**Known patient lastname 11972**] is an 83F asthma/COPD who returns with shortness of breath after being discharged today. She was originally admitted with 3d of worsening shortness of breath and wheezing and was treated for COPD exacerbation after an URI ([**Date range (1) 16589**]). She had been started on a course of steroids and completed course of azithromycin. She arrived home at 4PM and at approximately 630 she developed shortness of breath while sitting on the couch and told her daughter to call the ambulance. She felt dizzy at the time. She had no associated chest pain, diaphoresis, nausea. She denies fevers, chills, palpitations, abdominal pain. She states that she was concerned about leaving the hospital today because she was started on a new antihypertensive. She says she does not do well with new medications and was worried about how it would affect her. She took Diltiazem 30mg this morning and reports weakness and fatigue beginning this morning. It continued throughout the day but did not necessarily worsen while at home. She continues to feel weak. She did not take any medications at home. In the ED, the patient's vital signs were T 97.2, BP 240/140, RR 26, O2 sat 100% on CPAP. EMS gave the patient SL NTG and brought her in on Bipap. CXR was unchanged from previous. CPAP was stopped on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] and patient was quickly weaned to 2L NC 95-100% oxygenation. An aspirin was given in the ED, but no nebulizers as patient was back at baseline. She is being admitted for monitoring of dyspnea. On arrival to the floor the patient says her breathing is close to her baseline. 
This is an 83 yo female with a past medical history of COPD, HTN, CHF who p/w resp distress from home. She was discharged yesterday from the hospital during which she was treated for hypertensive urgency in the setting of dyspnea and anxiety. She responded promptly to SL nitroglycerin and BiPap and experienced no further dyspnea and was discharged to home on [**6-9**]. Her medications were adjusted during this admission to continue nifedipine, but to exchange diltiazem for verapamil, and per the patient's daughter, she obtained several doses of verapamil until she could fill the new prescriptions (she was NOT sent home with these doses, which was confirmed with the [**Hospital Ward Name **] 2 nursing staff). The patient arrived home from the hospital after 6pm and received 3 medications she had at home, it is unclear if the diltiazem was one of these medications. She then became acutely distressed today and called EMS. Upon EMS arrival, she was found to be hypertensive to 200/40 and bradycardic. She was intubated for resp distress in the field and was given atropine for HR in 30s (unclear if for hypotension). . Upon reaching ED- SBP in 90s and she was satting well on the vent. She was found to be in a new junctional rythm on EKG in 30's 40's. In the ED, she received glucagon, versed, levoflox, solumedrol, calcium and received fluid for an elevated lactate. A CXR revealed interstitial edema. [**Hospital Unit Name 194**] was consulted but did not feel that her respiratory failure was CHF related. UA neg. She received an additional dose of atropine for HR in the 20's prior to transfer to the MICU. She is admitted to the MICU for further work up and management.

This is a 59 yo F with PMH significant for Breast CA with last chemotherapy on [**11-15**] (Taxotere, carboplatin, and Herceptin) with an ANC 686 now with increased right sided facial swelling, erythema, warmth, and pain for 1 day. The pt was in her usual state of health until 1 week prior when she began to notice oral lesions occuring over the lips and on the oral mucosa.  These lesions were painful and were limiting PO intake.  She was reportedly perscribed Acyclovir by her oncologist to treat presumed HSV infection, however she never filled the perscription.  Over the course of the week the lesions largely improved with decreased pain and erythema. However, on the morning of admission she awoke with right-sided facial swelling, redness, and pain.  She felt feverish and her temperature measured at home was 100.9.  She called her oncologist who recomended that she go to the ED. Of note, Pt reports change in vision in the right eye which started 3 days before admission.  She reports a "wavey line" in her field of view.  It does not interfere with her acuity, she denies diplopia, pain with movement, seeing halos, and associated headaces. Also of note, pt noted diarrhea begining on Monday, which largely resolved by Wednesday.  On Friday she was started on Cipro and since then diarrhea has completely resolved.

Pt reported substernal Chest pain along with sinus tachycardia that subsided as tachycardia resolved. Facial swellin was evaluated with CT face, which was concerning for subcutaneous air,raising concern for necrotizing process.  ENT evaluation found oral lesions which may be responsible for the entrance of air into her facial soft tissue structures.  ID was conslted, and recommended daptomycin, meropenem, and clindamycin. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 17266**] is a 67-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and CAD, s/p MI and multiple PCIs. His most recent cardiac catheterization was on [**2953-4-16**] where he was found to have a 40% lesion in his LMCA, a 50% stenosis in the proximal LAD, and a 100% stenosis in the OM2. The RCA was known to be occluded and not engaged. His stents were patent. . Of note, he began using nitroglycerin tablets about a month ago. This helped his chest pain which usually last about 10mins. The CP usually occurs one hour after he eats. He reports that the nitroglycerin used to work within 5 secs and now after a month of use, the NG start to work after a minute. The CP also increased in intensity from previously [**3-20**] to about [**8-20**]. Chest Pain is substernal without any radiation. Prior to the month, he did not use NG and suffered through the CP - usually waiting for it to pass by resting. He used to be able to finish a golf game by taking frequent rest on the golf cart. During his previous admission earlier this year, he deferred CABG due to the fact that it did not fit with his schedule. . He presented to [**Hospital3 **] ED with complaints of chest discomfort on and off all night. Apparently he would take a nitroglycerin and the pain would resolve for approximately 30 minutes then return. He did not tell his wife who is a RN at [**Name (NI) **] because he didn't want her to call EMS. On the morning of admission, he was diaphoretic and she asked what was the matter. He told her he had been having chest discomfort all night and taken a total of 8 nitroglycerin. He presented to the ED at 9:30 am this morning pain free with a blood pressure of 181/105 (question nitroglycerin outdated). He was given an inch of nitropaste and his b/p is now 132/75, HR 69. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6961**] has requested patient be transferred for cardiac catheterization. His first troponin is 0.18, his finger stick was 279 but he was not given any coverage because he took his am hypoglycemics. . On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain and dyspnea on exertion. Negative for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. 
The patient is a 65-year-old female hospitalized in [**3017-5-20**] for a left lower lobe pneumonia with a history of hypoxemia, chronic hypercarbia on home O2, who was brought to the Emergency Room following a fall at home.  In the ER, she was anxious, disoriented with O2 sats 70s-80s.  An ABG was performed and revealed a PCO2 of 120.  Subsequently, the patient was placed on biPAP with some improvement of her mental status.  Of note, she was brought to the Emergency Room the day before by her husband after she had become shaky and tremulous at home and had suffered a fall at home.  She was confused by the report of her family members.  She was given ativan and discharged and she continued to do poorly at home.  They called her PCP who found her bicarb level to be 54 which had been drawn in the Emergency Room.  The patient denies cough, occasionally has chest pain.  She cannot really describe it well in nature. She is a poor historian.  Shortness of breath at baseline. No nausea.  No vomiting.  No diaphoresis.  She does not snore according to her husband.  She has been more somnolent over the past week with frequent daytime napping. 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 18487**] is a 72-year-old woman with a history of COPD on 2L home O2 (FEV1/FVC 51% on [**2-20**]), diastolic heart failure, HTN, and afib on warfarin who presents to the ED with dyspnea and is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for hypoxic respiratory failure. She was in her usual state of health until a few weeks ago when she noted noted increasing dyspnea on exertion, with worsening over the last few days.  During this period, she denied chest pain, cough, and fevers.  She presented to her PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] scheduled appointment and was found to be satting 87% on 2L, 91% on 3L.  An EKG was negative for acute changes.  She was referred to the ED for further evaluation. In the ED, initial vs were: 97.2 80 132/76 18 86%4L O2.  Her exam was notable for inspiratory wheezes bilaterally, and a CXR demonstrated ?right lower lobe infiltrate; a chest CTA was negative for PE and demonstrated ?atelectasis versus infiltrate in the region.  She was given ceftriaxone and azithro (she denied a pcn allergg) and started on IV solumedrol 125.  She received 2g IV magnesium for Mg 1.3 and aspirin 325.  Her ABG was 7.45/47/67.  She required 5.5L O2 to reach O2 sats in the 90s and desatted to the 80s with movement.  EKG demonstrated no acute changes and BNP was near baseline at 393.  Because of concern for increasing O2 requirement, admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] was requested. On the floor, she is comfortable and requesting food and medication to help her sleep. Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

Dr. [**Known patient lastname 17293**] returns today.  She is just about two months out from her [**3221-1-21**] primary right total hip replacement here at [**Hospital1 18**].  She is doing extremely well.  She has been given a referral to outpatient physical therapy.  She says she has virtually no pain in the right hip at all.  Her focus is shifted to the contralateral left hip discomfort, which radiographically shows a similar presentation of advanced osteoarthritis.  This pain propagates down the leg to the level of the mid tibia.  While the component of it may be radicular in nature from the back, I think most of it is certainly coming from the hip.  Towards that end, we sterilely prepped out the left knee today and injected with Celestone 1 mL plus Marcaine 2 mL in the hope that the predominance of left knee pain over left lower extremity pain in general may be alleviated.  We do not have any x-rays on this knee, but if the cortisone shot helps, then we will perform radiography at the next visit.  As for now, we will get her in to outpatient physical therapy.  She takes antibiotics all the time for dental prophylaxis because of her cardiac valvular disease.  She is very pleased.  She is starting to work on increasing her stamina and potentially as she gets more fit, she will be able to, I am sure walk further faster and increase her activity levels.  At some point in the future, she may opt to have a similar procedure done on the left hip, but that is not at all in the cards for this point. She comes in for L THR. I would like to see her back in two months' time.  She is doing extremely well.  We will check on her ambulatory status at that point.  She should be full weightbear and using just a cane at this point. 
This is a 69 year old male with multiple medical problems, who was originally admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2969-6-1**], with the complaint of abdominal pain, hypotension and respiratory failure.  CT scan of the abdomen at that time showed a dilated [**Year (4 digits) 493**] and no other pathology.  The patient underwent rigid colonoscopy in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit which relieved the dilatation and allowed the patient to pass stool in there.  Initial blood and urine cultures were positive for E. coli in the urine and the patient was subsequently treated with Levaquin while on the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for urosepsis. The patient was briefly on Levophed pressors for two days for hypotension, however, the patient subsequently responded to intravenous fluid hydration and was weaned off the Levophed, however, during the Surgical Intensive Care Unit admission, the patient had difficulty weaning off the ventilator and was subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2969-6-5**].  The patient underwent a bronchoscopy while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit which showed patent airways, scant foamy secretions bilaterally.  Subsequently, the patient was diuresed with Bumex because the patient had been 11 liters positive during the time that the patient was on the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  After diuresis, the patient was able to be extubated without any problem.  [**Name (NI) **] was extubated on [**2969-6-6**] without difficulty.  On that date, the patient had started to develop diarrhea. On [**2969-6-8**], the diarrhea started to become bloody.  The GI Service was consulted and on that date, the third out of third stool for Clostridium difficile came back positive. The initial first two stools were negative for C. difficile; the third one came positive.  Subsequently, the patient was started on Flagyl 500 mg p.o. three times a day for C. difficile colitis and the Levaquin which the patient was being given for the urosepsis was discontinued.  The patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit for increased oxygen requirement which resolved with chest pulmonary toilet, mobilization and mobilization of secretions.  The volume of diarrhea subsequently significantly decreased after day four of ten of the Flagyl for C. difficile colitis and the patient was then transferred to the Medical Floor for further management. 
This is a 61 year old gentleman with a history of hyperlipidemia,  smoking (quit 2 months ago), and a family history of CAD.  He reports that he has had jaw pain associated with dyspnea for the past few weeks.  He was seen by PCP and sent for a stress MIBI on [**2709-2-5**], the resting portion was completed and he was noted to be in atrial fibrillation, the stress test was terminated and he was seen by his PCP who started him on Warfarin and Atenolol and sent cardiac enzymes. Troponin T returned elevated at 0.16 and he was sent to the ED. On further questioning, the patient has had this jaw pain for about a year.  It occurred only with exertion and never with rest.  Only in the last few weeks was it associated with dyspnea and this was what prompted him to seek medical attention. In the ED , VS were T 97.9 P 97 BP 116/63 RR 16 O2 96 RA his isolated troponin was 0.16 (CK 124 MB 4), no significant ekg changes, TSH was wnl, he was started on Heparin, Aspirin, beta blockade administered.  He was subsequently admitted for further evaluation and treatment.

62 year old male was seen in clinic on [**2980-9-8**], at which time he was complaining of progressive worsening of chest tightness with exertion. He noted symptoms typically with walking up hills as well as stairs or during periods of stress that he would develop chest pressure which became severe enough to cause him to stop. This always resolved within a few seconds of stopping activity. During a stress echocardiogram on [**2980-11-28**] he was found to have 1-1.[**Street Address(2) 17382**] depressions in inferolateral leads. He had a concomitant echocardiogram which showed an EF of 40-45% with 1-2+ eccentric mitral regurgitation and anterior basal and apical hypokinesis with no evidence of any wall motion abnormalities with exercise in the setting of what was determined to be a suboptimal study. He was referred for coronary angiography. He was found to have three vessel disease and is being referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization. 
A 74 year old male with renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the lungs, embolic cerebrovascular accident history with residual left-sided paresis, atrial fibrillation, status post failed cardioversion times three, left ventricular hypertrophy, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**3201-12-30**] with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and decompensated on the floor and was in severe respiratory distress and was intubated on [**3202-1-3**].  He had failure to wean since [**1-3**].  Workup at the outside hospital included a spiral computerized tomographic angiography which was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed bilateral mid bronchus mass that was narrowing the airways.  An echocardiogram at the outside hospital showed an ejection fraction of 65%, biatrial enlargement, 2+ mitral regurgitation, and a small effusion.  The patient there received radiation to the chest for two weeks and suffered radiation burns to his back.  The patient was also treated for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, pneumonia and Clostridium difficile there.  He was transferred here for evaluation of placement of a stent palliatively.  The patient's primary oncologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1710**] works here. On arrival to this hospital the patient was complaining of being hungry, no other complaints, no shortness of breath, no chest pain, no abdominal pain and no nausea. 
This is a 79-year-old male, with a history of coronary artery disease and known left carotid artery blockage, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, who was seen in the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department on [**2650-12-28**]. The patient states that he had had chest pain last evening lasting approximating 5 minutes after exertion.  The patient describes the chest pain as burning, substernal, no radiation, no nausea, vomiting, no diaphoresis, no shortness of breath.  The patient stated that the pain was relieved after 5 minutes after taking a Nitroglycerin tablet.  The patient states that he has often had this pain at night after exerting himself.  The patient states that this pain has been unchanged.  The patient denies orthopnea or lower extremity swelling. The patient reports that he has had a stress test in the past.  Upon review, it was noticed that the patient was exercised for 10 minutes using a modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol and was stopped due to fatigue.  At peak exercise, there was approximately 2.0-2.5 mm down-sloping ST depression in anterior and lateral leads, and slightly less in the inferior leads.  These changes were noted in the presence of a baseline abnormal ECG of right bundle branch block and left ventricular hypertrophy with prominent T wave abnormalities. This exercise stress test was essentially unchanged from an earlier test performed in [**2646-3-9**]. PREVIOUS MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease. 2. Hyperlipidemia. 3. Hypertension. 4.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 17474**] is an 81-year-old white male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and a remote tobacco history, who was in generally good health with no known coronary artery disease, and presented to an outside hospital with acute shortness of breath the night prior to admission while sitting and watching television.  He stated that his shortness of breath worsened with ambulation and other activity.  He denied having any associated chest pain, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, or diaphoresis.  He was taken to the Emergency Department of the outside hospital, where an EKG done showed poor R wave progression in leads V1 through V3.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled and showed a troponin of 39.21, and a CK of 246.  At this time he was transferred to the coronary care unit at the outside hospital, where a chest x-ray was found to be consistent with congestive heart failure.  The patient received a 40 mg intravenous dose of Lasix, and responded with a 1,200 cc diuresis.  He was started on heparin, aspirin, a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor.  The heparin was however discontinued secondary to some mild hematuria.  He continued to remain symptom free, and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 186**] for cardiac catheterization. 
This is an 81 year old man who is status post [**2699-1-13**], three vessel coronary artery bypass graft performed here at [**Hospital1 69**], also with congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%.  He was sent to [**Hospital 38**] Rehabilitation post coronary artery bypass graft for physical rehabilitation. He developed the dysphagia at the rehabilitation center and there was sent to an outside hospital where he underwent a barium swallow which he failed.  The patient also during his rehabilitation stay developed urinary retention.  A Foley was placed but this was followed by hematuria. The Foley was placed with a three-way Foley. Hematuria continued and removal of the three-way Foley was difficult.  The family decided at that point to transfer the patient back to [**Hospital1 1426**] for workup of the dysphagia, as well as the management of the three-way Foley by the Department of Urology here at [**Hospital1 186**]. 
Patient is an 81-year-old man who underwent a CABG on [**2699-1-13**] at [**Hospital1 341**].  Patient was sent to [**Hospital 38**] Rehabilitation Center postoperatively.

On the day of admission, she asked her rehab staff to check her hct again and it was found to be 19 so she presented to the ED.  At her last discharge it was discussed that she needed outpatient transfusions for chronic anemia and was supposed to start getting these beginning [**8-13**].  Of note, the patient reports daily nosebleeds for the last three months which wet about 3 tissues before resolution.  She denies any BRBPR or melena. Stool guaiac was negative.  She has chronic diarrhea but reports an increase in frequency of stooling to [**8-4**] time daily while at rehab which as resolved with PO vanc and loperamide.  She does report new pain during stooling for the last few weeks.  She denies abdominal pain at rest. Per records she has orthostatic hypotension at baseline and takes midodrine and fludrocortisone, but felt that she had worsened in the last week.  She also complains of lightheadedness, fatigue, and "decreased executive functioning." She apparently has baseline low blood pressure to the 80s-90s. Of note, during her previous admission to [**Hospital1 18**] (d/c on [**7-20**]) she was treated with IVF for hypotension, and given vanc/meropenam for concern for sepsis.  At this time she also had diarrhea thought to be from viral gastroenteritis which self-resolved and she was discharged to rehab. She also complains of thickening nails beginning 3 months ago and a painful purpuric rash appearing on her hads a few days ago.  Dermatology has been consulted and recommended urea cream. She also complains of painless darkened elbows for around two weeks. In the ED initial VS were 99.8 70 83/48 18 99% RA.  Labs notable for WBC 2.4, Hct 19.5, platelets 123, INR 2.7.

61 year old female with T1DM s/p pancreatic transplant [**3240**], CABG, prior NSTEMIs, CHF, ESRD with failed renal transplants and now on peritoneal HD, CHF, orthostatic hypotension on midodrine and fludrocortisone, presented to ED with chills, low grade temp and poor temperature who was noted to be hypoxic and hypotensive. Upon review of her records, she is always hypotensive and she is very at her baseline upon present. Of note, she was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 717**] in [**3248-6-26**], at which point an immunologic workup was performed, revealing CD4 lymphopenia. She had normal IgA and IgM as well as IgG levels at that time. She was started on pneumocystis prophylaxis as well as [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis and reported negative HIV testing at the rehab center. She was seen by ID on [**10-27**] at which point she was switched from pentamidine to mepron for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1088**] (**verify with pt). Her CD4 count was rechecked and found to be 165. In the ED, initial vitals were 98.8 70 85/60 22 98%. Labs were notable for normal CBC and chem7 except for Cr of 6.1 (at baseline). CXR was notable for no acute process. She was started on vanc, levo, and flagyl for presumed septic process. She was noted to have a temp of 101.4. She also got tylenol for fever and levophed for hypotension to the 60s systolic. A right femoral CVL was placed. Vitals on transfer: 77 86/49 16 99%. On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**], her vitals were 106/57, 85, 97% on 3L. The pt reports that last night she began shivering incessantly and had a low grade temp of 99 (she normally runs 96-97). She has also been feeling very drowsy and weak. In the ED, they were having to tell her to take her medications multiple times before she would finally respond. She denies pain anywhere except for her sacrum, which is baseline. She frequently has diarrhea with on and off positive C.diff cultures. She reports that her last c. diff infection was 6-8wks ago. She did have diarrhea about 2 nights ago, but it was mainly loose, soft stool - nothing like her normal c. diff diarrhea. She took an immodium and it resolved like usual. She is not having and chest or abdominal pain or trouble breathing. No dizziness or lightheadedness, just weakness. In addition, this morning she was nauseated but did not vomit. She feels that her blood pressure may be low because the rehab facility took off too much fluid during peritoneal dialysis.

Patient is a 46-year-old male with a complicated cardiac history including coronary artery disease status post CABG x2 ([**3185**], [**3198**]), pericardial constriction status post stripping, diastolic dysfunction, stable angina (patient no longer an operative candidate per Cardiothoracic Surgery).  Patient also with history of diabetes mellitus type 1, hypercholesterolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, and chronic pleural effusion, who is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 194**] service on [**3206-11-7**] in decompensated heart failure. Patient complained of progressive shortness of breath and pedal edema as well as an approximately 11 pound weight gain over the past 2-3 weeks.  While on the floor, diuresis was attempted with Lasix and nesiritide, but patient's heart failure was refractory to treatment, in addition he had worsening renal failure and became hypotensive.  He was subsequently transferred to the CCU for PA catheterization and further evaluation of hemodynamics/tailored CHF therapy. Upon transfer, the patient denied complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, or dizziness, fever or chills. 
52 yo M with PMH DM I, CAD s/p CABG x2, asthma, mental retardation, and germ cell tumor with mestastasis to LUL invading the pulmonary artery as well as occluding the LUL bronchus and LLL bronchus, who presents from an OSH for possible debulking of the metastases. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital3 13174**] on [**3213-6-13**] for elective bronchoscopy, which found an endobronchial growth occluding the take-off of the LLL and most of the LUL. During the bx, the pt had massive hemoptysis requiring intubation. Pt was transferred to the ICU and had electrocautery, which successfully stopped the bleeding. He had an additional 6 biopsies, which showed germ cell tumor, nonseminoma metastasized from the testicles. By CT scan, it appeared that the tumor was invading the pulmonary artery as well. Pt was extubated in the ICU after 24hrs. He had pulmonary edema secondary to his known cardiac disease, which improved after lasix. His course was also complicated by [**Doctor First Name 48**], that improved with fluid down to 1.1 from 1.49. He also had SOB during the admission, worse with lying down, with a known R pleural effusion. . Pt had TTE at the OSH on [**3213-6-17**] that showed normal EF, LV normal size but wall motion difficult to assess, mild MV thickening, trace MR, . Currently,  the patient feels short of breath and has a cough, but otherwise has no complaints. He says he's not sure of what went on at the prior hospital.

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of mantle cell lymphoma, blastic variant, who presented on [**2730-3-27**] with fevers and a white blood cell count of 1.2.  The patient was status post two cycles of hyper-CVAD therapy with a downtrending white blood cell count from this therapy. The patient initially presented in [**2729-11-23**] when he noted pallor and fatigue.  A laboratory workup at that time showed him to be anemic with mantle cells in his peripheral smear.  A computed tomography scan showed diffuse mediastinal, axillary, retroperitoneal, and deep pelvis lymphadenopathy.  In addition, the patient's spleen was markedly enlarged. In [**2729-12-23**] the patient [**Year (4 digits) 1811**] a cycle of hyper-CVAD chemotherapy which was complicated by febrile neutropenia.  In [**2730-1-23**], he [**Year (4 digits) 1811**] part B of this first cycle of hyper-CVAD chemotherapy.  This was complicated by mucositis.  In [**2730-2-23**], he [**Year (4 digits) 1811**] a second cycle of hyper-CVAD chemotherapy.  In this session, the patient was noted to develop atrial fibrillation which spontaneously reverted to a sinus rhythm.  The patient also [**Year (4 digits) 1811**] part B of the second cycle of hyper-CVAD in [**2730-2-23**]. After the second cycle of hyper-CVAD therapy the patient developed a cough productive of blood/green sputum.  The patient had this cough two days prior to presenting to his oncologist.  The patient presented for a computed tomography scan for further workup of a nodule noted on chest x-ray. During this presentation, the patient was found to be febrile.  At that time, he denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.  His cardiac review of systems was entirely negative. The patient was admitted to the hospital for workup of his fever. 
This 73 year-old female presented with complaint of increasing shortness of breath and cough for approximately six months getting progressively worse.  For the week prior to presentation the patient was having significant cough with expectoration associated with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea.  The patient has previously echocardiogram in [**2634-10-18**] which demonstrates preserved left ventricular systolic function but the presence of significant valvular gradient across the prosthetic mitral valve which has a mean of approximately 17 mmHg and a calculated mitral valve area of 1 sq cm.  The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 186**] on pressors, was stable hemodynamically and remained afebrile with mass approximately 30 to 34 for presumed thrombotic mitral valve.  Patient was admitted and patient had progressive shortness of breath, was intubated for respiratory distress initially, treated for cardiac shock, then presumed septic shock.  Outside hospital echo showed a VA of only 1 cm sq with gradient of 20 mmHg, PA line at the outside hospital showed increasing RV, increasing PA, increasing RVR and PCWP is 25 to 35. ALLERGIES:  To penicillin, fiorinal. CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Vasopressin 0.1, levo 0.6, Versed on transfer. MEDICATION AS OUTPATIENT:  Toprol, lisinopril. Patient had a TE in the Cardiac Care Unit on [**1-16**] that showed dilated severely hypercontractile right ventricle, small hyperdynamic left ventricular, peak pressure across the MV of 50 to 64 mmHg with mean of greater than 40, severe TR.

58 yo with PMH morbid obesity ?CMP w/ EF 40-45%, afib/flutter on amio at home, COPD, OSA, IDDM, tonsillar CA s/p chemo/XRT [**1-2**] with PEG. He was feeling generally well in his USOH and was witnessed falling to his bathroom floor in AM [**1-20**]. His son performed CPR until EMS arrived and found him in VF arrest (down-time <5 min). He was intubated in the field was converted out of VF with 1 shock, then transported to [**Hospital6 **] where he was given lidocaine 100mg x 1 in the ED and started on amiodarone drip. . His cardiac enzymes were negative and his electrolytes were not derranged; His other labs were simply notable for a low hct of 27.1. . [**1-21**] midnight he was found to be in Vtach and was defibrillated x 3 "with transient response;" he was kept on amiodarone drip. He again went into pulseless VT and CPR was performed; he received lidocaine 100mg x 1 with good response; he was then started on lido drip at 2mg. He then had another VT event which was resolved by repeat lidocaine bolus and increasing drip to 3mg. The lidocaine drip was stopped today as per EP recommendations. . As per verbal report (not seen in notes) He has gone into sustained monomorphic VT 6 times with 2 episodes converting to VF; he was successfully defibrillated out of VF x 2. He was cardioverted out of VT x 4. He is transferred here for further management. 
51 yo man with DM, HTN, LE claudication, presenting with worsening dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea for approximately 2 weeks, found to have elevated BNP and TropT 0.4 with CXR suggestive of pulmonary edema in ED, who developed worsening dyspnea after receiving contrast for CT to r/u PE. For two weeks, patient had 3-4 episodes of difficulty breathing and chest tightness at night, some dyspnea on exertion, and general malaise.  The chest tightness at night was diffuse with no radiation, diaphoresis, or nausea, and resolved along with the difficulty breathing when he stood up and used his inhaler. He has also noticed productive cough with clear non-bloody sputum for the past two weeks which has been worsening. Went to PCP after sx acutely worsened and was found to have low sats and sinus tach, for which he was sent to ED for PE work up. In the ED, EKG wnl, trop 0.4, CXR showed pulmonary edema but he was persistently tachycardic so CT PE was done. After lying down and getting contrast for the CTA, he developed worsening dyspnea with desatting to 80s. . He received nitro gtt and 60 of lasix for concern of flash edema, and benadryl/solumedrol for questionable allergic reaction. He continued to have SOB so he was put on CPAP/100% FiO2.  He was satting 100% and feeling much better, so FiO2 was weaned to 40%. He was put on heparin gtt for possible NSTEMI. Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  He endorses calf pain bilaterally when walking for more than half a mile, which resolves with rest, and has been present for approximately 6 months. 
70 y/o male with HTN, hypercholesterolemia s/p inferior STEMI with cath showing 50% LCx and 90% distal RCA, s/p cypher stent to RCA.  Pt. received ASA, plavix, and integrillin in cath lab. . On floor in the evening post-cath, Pt. had large volume melena/BRBPR.  Integrillin gtt was immediately d/c'd and volume resuscitation initiated.  GI was contact[**Name (NI) **].  Pt. soon after became nauseated and had lg. volume hemetemesis with frank clot. An NG-tube was placed and lavage revealed many clots, and bloody fluid after 4L lavage.  Hct dropped from 36 to 23.  Pt. received 4U pRBC via IV on floor and 2 doses of 40mg IV protonix.  A right-IJ Cordis catheter was inserted at this time. The pt was evaluated by GI, with plan for emergent upper endoscopy. Blood transfusions continued upon transfer to CCU with protonix gtt. During EGD MAPs declined to 40-50s with sedation, levophed started at 1 mcg/kg/min with improvement to MAP 60-70s. A line placeed without incident. EGD further complicated by continued bloody emesis with clots despite erythromycin. Pt was intubated for airway protection. 
The patient is a 63 year old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus times 36 years, coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**3050**], who presented to the Emergency Department with a two day history of nausea, vomiting and fingerstick glucose of greater than 500 by home monitor.  Two days prior to admission, the patient was seen in Pain Clinic for worsening of chronic low back pain and was given a prescription for Percocet.  Since that time, the patient experienced nausea and vomiting with six to seven episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting associated with mild shortness of breath and mild diffuse abdominal pain.  The patient denied chest pain or diaphoresis (of note, the patient has never had chest pain).  The patient noted at this time fingerstick glucose of greater than 500 by home monitor with associated polyuria, On review of systems, the patient denied any fever, chills, headaches, cough, diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum, melena, changes in medications other than starting Percocet, recent illness or sick contact.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 1493**] is a 44-year-old gentleman who presented with a left groin mass this past [**Month (only) 541**] and was diagnosed with a large intermediate grade synovial sarcoma of the left pelvis extending through the femoral canal into the left groin. The mass measured up to 17 cm in size and appeared to nearly encase the external iliac artery and vein. Given the size, grade and vascular encasement of the tumor, I advised up-front neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy to a total radiation dose of 5000 Gy with low-dose Adriamycin as a radiosensitizer. He had no evidence of metastatic disease on cross sectional imaging. He completed his treatment in early [**Month (only) **] and follow-up staging scans showed a decrease in size of the mass, but continued short-segment encasement of the external iliac artery and vein. I advised radical resection of the mass and asked Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of vascular surgery to assist with possible resection of the left external iliac and common femoral artery and vein. In addition, I asked Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of plastic surgery to be available for likely myocutaneous flap reconstruction of the defect in the left groin. The patient understood the risks and benefits of the procedure and consented to proceed.

The patient is a 70yo man with diabetes mellitus type 2, CAD, 140 pack year smoking history, who was transferred at the request of his PCP from the [**Hospital6 33**] ICU to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU Friday [**3067-8-9**] for continued treatment of respiratory distress requiring supplemental O2, labile blood sugars, and a new lung mass found on CT. One week prior to admission to [**Hospital3 **] he developped a non-productive cough, fevers, and increased fatigue. He had a 10 pound unintentional weight loss over the past 1-2 months. On Monday [**3067-8-5**] he was found unresponsive at home with a FSBG of 21. He was working in his yard when he felt dyspneic and fatigued and sat down. He lost consciousness and awoke on the ground. He called a friend and EMS arrived shortly. . In the [**Hospital6 33**] ED he received glucagon and his glucose increased to 70. CXR revealed eosinophilic v. atypical PNA v. inflammation from COPD exacerbation, so he was started on Levaquin and Solumedrol and admitted. His BNP was elevated to 9248 and he was diuresed with Lasix 40 mg IV BID. On [**3067-8-7**] a chest CT demonstrated a 4 cm spiculated mass in the LLL and hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. While on steroids, he became hyperglycemic and he was transferred to the MICU for insulin gtt. In the MICU he became hypoxic and was placed on a NRB. CXR demonstrated bilateral airspace disease, pulmonary edema, and possible atypical PNA. On transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on [**8-9**], his SOB was slightly improved, but he felt fatigued. 
82yo female with a history of COPD was admitted from the ED with dyspnea. .

Ms. [**Known patient lastname 18946**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with h/o hypothyroidism who awoke at midnight with sudden onset shortness of breath. Symptoms persisted for one hour without improvement and EMS was called. . History was obtained from son [**Name (NI) 3017**] as patient was intubated and sedated at time of arrival. Patient has no prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She has not had any recent fevers, chills or rigors, exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. . Cardiac review of systems is notable only for the presence of dyspnea at rest. ROS is negative for any report of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. In the ED, patient was intubated emergently and code STEMI was called. She received versed 5 mg IV x 2, ativan 2 mg, ASA 600 mg, Plavix 600 mg, Integrillin bolus, Etomidate 20 mg IV, and Succinylcholine 12 mg, and was started on a heparin gtt. A nitro drip was initiated which resulted in hypotension. BP transiently responded to 1.5 L of NS. 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 71 year old with DM2, HTN, HLD, extensive vasculopathy including CAD s/p RCA stent [**2947**], bifemoral disease s/p L common iliac stent x 2, aortic stent who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1265**] Hospital for stenting of renal artery stenosis. Catheterization occurred on [**2958-2-28**] and was complicated by post-procedure hypotension and retroperitoneal bleed. She was hypotensive to SBPs in 40s tachycardic to 140s. Due to concern for perinephric/RP bleed a massive transfusion protocol was initiated. Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] was intubated, a dirty right femoral trauma line was placed, and she was maintained on pressors (ultimately requiring 3 pressors - dopamine, levo, and neo). ACT was 150, and 10 of protamine was given. Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] was taken emergenty for CTA of the abdomen which demonstrated a large perinephric hemorrhage with extension into the retroperitoneum. She was taken to IR where 3 peripheral branches of the right renal artery was embolized, and a HD line was placed under sterile procedure in the RIJ. In total 11 units of PRBCs, 4 of FFP and 2 of platelets. Due to persistent hyperkalemia (K of 6.4) she was given calcium gluconate, insulin and dextrose. Several amps of bicarb were administered for persistent lactic acidosis (HCO3 ~18-19) with ABG 7.17/43/116/17. Increasing abdominal girth and increasing peak pressures to 40 were noted during the procedure, and surgery was consulted for possible compartment syndrome. . Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] on Thursday when her BP was elevated to 200s whilst recieving procrit, per the family her BP was in the 150s at home. She was treated for a CHF exacerbation thought to be secondary to flash pulmonary edema. Her BP was managed with labetalol 600 [**Hospital1 **], Isosorbide Mononitrate 90 mg QD, Hydralazine 25mg [**Hospital1 **], and Lasix 80 mg QD. RUS demonstrated > 60% stenosis of the R renal artery. While at [**Hospital1 **] they were able to diurese her and improve her respiratory status, but her renal function worsened from a baseline Cr of 2.4 to 3.8 on transfer. Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], vitals were 97.7 163/67 84 20 91/2L. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. 
[**Age over 90 **] y ear old female with advanced Alzheimer's Disease, asthma, and recent Right distal femur fracture s/p ORIF on [**1-11**] presents [**1-18**] from nursing home with hypoxia. There, she was found to be tachypneic with RR in 30s, O2 sat 87% RA, 90% on 2L. EMS was called, and she was given SL NTG and IV lasix.  Per her daughter, over the past 2 days, she has been more somnolent than usual. She had no complaints except leg pain and involuntary movements of her right arm. She denied cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, urinary symptoms, diarrhea. Her daughter also noted that her left arm was swollen but does not know for how long. In the ED, the patient was febrile to 104.8. Her respiratory rate was in the 30s. Her O2 sats were 85-90% RA, and she was placed on NRB. Due to continued respiratory distress, she was intubated. Following intubation, she was noted to have coffee grounds in her ET tube, which cleared with lavage. She was given IV protonix, in addition to IVF, levofloxacin, vancomycin, metronidazole, combivent, and Decadron prior to admission to the medical ICU. On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**], she was sedated from propofol. She was shivering and diaphoretic. 
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 18953**] is a 71 yo female with atrial fibrillation on coumadin/arpirin/plavix, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure who presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2922-11-5**]. She tripped while walking down the stairs and hit her head on a driveway. Afterwards she had only epistaxis but denied headache or LOC. At [**Hospital1 **], a head CT showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage so she was transferred here for neurosurgical evaluation. She was initially awake, alert and oriented with a normal neuro exam in their ED, but she developed a left facial droop and UE weakness during the ambulance ride. . In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was intubated upon arrival for airway protection secondary to worsening mental status and emesis/bloody secretions. She received proplex, dilantin, FFP, and platelets in the ED. A repeat head CT here revealed large bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages as well as a large right-sided intraparenchymal hemorrhage. She was admitted to the MICU as Neurosurgery did not recommend surgical intervention. . In the MICU, her INR was reversed (was 2.9 due to being on coumadin). Another CT scan the morning after admission showed slight subfalcine herniation. She was started on mannitol. Her mental status improved where she was intermittently following commands. Initially, she was placed on vancomycin and ceftriaxone which were discontinued after 3 days. She was diuresed in order to maximally wean her from the vent. The mannitol was tapered. Per neurosurgery, it was okay to restart coumadin (on [**11-13**]) but this was not done by the MICU team. The MICU team did discuss anticoagulation with the patient's family on multiple occasions, including the risks and benefits of remaining off of the anticoagulation with her known atrial fibrillation and cardiac dysfunction. . Her fingersticks were difficult to control requiring an insulin drip while in the ICU. Serial head CTs were unchanged. In the ICU, she became febrile and was placed on vancomycin and meropenem for an 8 day course. Bronchoscopy revealed diffuse friable mucosa in both bronchial trees and a small amount of thin secretions. Lavage of her left upper lobe grew nothing, but sputum culture did grow MSSA. Blood cultures grew coagulase negative Staph from 1/4 bottles and were felt to be contaminant. Her central line was removed and a PICC was placed prior to coming to the floor. . It was difficult to get her therapeutic on Dilantin so she was changed to keppra. She was extubated on [**11-17**]. Her c-spine was unable to be cleared clinically as she could not flex or extend her neck on command. However, the family felt very strongly that her collar should be removed, so it was. She had a bedside swallow on [**11-19**] which she failed. However, this was difficult to interpret as she was not fully alert. She did begin speaking single words. She was called out to the floor from the ICU on [**11-21**]. 
This is an 87 year old woman with a history of COPD with two to three days of worsening confusion and worsening dyspnea.  She denies cough, congestion or fever.  She had sweats on the day prior to admission.  Sick contact positive for family member at home with a cough and temperature of 102.  In the emergency department the patient had an arterial blood gas of 7.24/126/259.  She had pulse oximetry saturation of 76% on 3 liters of O2.  BiPAP was attempted, but the patient was unable to tolerate it.  She was intubated and transferred to the medical intensive care unit. 
[**Age over 90 **]y/o F with h/o COPD on home O2 presents with acute SOB, hypercarbia requiring intubation.  Per son, was doing ok at baseline (never leaves house, on 3L NC, on nebs) until 2-3 days ago, when she developed worsening SOB.  No cough or fever.  No chest pain or URI symptoms.  On transfer, was breathing at 40, BiPAP attempted with sats in 90s.  Initial ABG 7.28/85/449 (on BiPAP), decision made to intubate.  Started on propofol and SBP dropped to 50s systolic - D/C'ed propofol and gave fluid bolus, pressures improved.  Pt switched to fentanyl/versed.  Also given IV solumedrol.  Fem TLC placed. 
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, with an ejection fraction of 20%, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, depression, and anxiety. It should be noted that for atrial fibrillation, the patient has not been on Coumadin, and there is a question of whether this is chronic versus paroxysmal. The patient's ejection fraction is 20% by echocardiogram done at [**Hospital6 253**] last month. The patient was admitted initially to the MICU with respiratory distress and acute renal failure.  The patient was unable to answer questions, so all history was obtained by the patient's primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 5688**]. The patient lives is an assisted-living facility.  He had mildly elevated creatinine to 2.5 one week prior to admission.  This was felt to be secondary to Lasix for congestive heart failure.  There is little history for past week, but the patient saw his primary care physician on the day of admission, and was tachypneic and sent to the Emergency Room for evaluation.  Oxygen saturation could not be obtained, but ABG revealed a paO2 of 112 on 100% nonrebreather.  The patient was also hypotensive with an SBP in the 80s on presentation, but blood pressure increased to 120 on 1 L normal saline bolus. Labs obtained that day found the patient to be hyperkalemic at 6.3.  Creatinine was 5.4.   Electrocardiogram revealed new ST depressions and T-wave inversions in V1-V3.  The patient was given Kayexalate and admitted to the MICU for further care. 
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with three vessel coronary artery disease with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure and ejection fraction of 55%, chronic renal insufficiency, and hypertension, who was sent to the Emergency Department from home after being noted to have shortness of breath at home.  Very scant records, but per the home health aid, the patient was found to be mottled with rales half way up.  The patient received sublingual Nitroglycerin times two and 80 mg of Lasix intravenous with urine output.  In the Emergency Department, the patient was noted to be in pulmonary edema and also developed sustained ventricular tachycardia for two minutes with hypotension.  He was started on Amiodarone drip.  The patient was also put on BiPAP for signs of hypoxia.  At that point, there was discussion with the family and with the patient and he was confirmed to be DNR/DNI, no shocks, no pressors, no catheterizations.  The patient was then transferred to the CCU where his blood pressure was 96/54, heart rate 70, respiratory rate 16, 100% nonrebreather mask. The patient denied chest pressure or chest pain and states that his shortness of breath had improved. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, in general, the patient was responsive to voice, breathing more comfortably, temperature 97.4, blood pressure 97/47, heart rate 79, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 100% on nonrebreather mask.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements are intact.  Sclera nonicteric.  Neck was supple with jugular venous distention at eight centimeters.  The lungs had decreased breath sounds at the bases, rales two thirds of the way up.  Cardiovascular was regular rate and rhythm, with II to III/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.  Hemoccult positive per the Emergency Department.  Extremities showed no edema. LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 18.1, hemoglobin 13.6, hematocrit 43.0, platelet count 276,000.  Sodium 139, potassium 4.5, chloride 102, bicarbonate 16, blood urea nitrogen 36, creatinine 1.5, glucose 313.  CK 194, troponin 1.1, and Digoxin level was less than 0.3. The urinalysis was within normal limits. The first electrocardiogram at 3:15 a.m. showed atrial fibrillation at 105 beats per minute with a left axis deviation, wide QRS complexes with frequent ectopy, ST depressions in V4 through V6.  The electrocardiogram at 6:55 a.m. showed a sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute with left axis deviation, prolonged PR interval.  This was post Amiodarone.  ST depression 2.0 millimeters in V4 through V6 and in aVL.  Chest x-ray showed pronounced congestive heart failure with volume overload and bilateral small pleural effusions. On [**3209-5-18**], the patient ruled in with a peak CK of 432 and MB fraction of 79. The Amiodarone was discontinued and Heparin was started. Lopressor dose was increased and the patient also was noted to have some intermittent nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, three beats on the monitor.  On the evening of [**3209-5-18**], the Metoprolol was held for bradycardia and in addition, there was an echocardiogram that was performed which showed severe impairment in the left ventricular function compared with the echocardiogram of [**2-24**].  Of note, the echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20 to 30% with anteroapical hypokinesis, mild aortic insufficiency, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, diastolic dysfunction, severe dilation of the left ventricle with a normal thickness.  As a result of the low ejection fraction, the patient was then started on Lisinopril 5 mg p.o.  He tolerated this quite well.  On [**3209-5-19**], the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable and remained in normal sinus rhythm. His discharge plans were discussed and there was an extensive discussion regarding anticoagulation, however, it was felt that at this time given the patient's age and risk of falling that anticoagulation would not be opted for despite the fact that the patient has atrial fibrillation as well as wall motion abnormalities.  The final decision regarding anticoagulation will be up to the patient's primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1251**].  The patient was advised to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1251**] in two to three days for renal function tests as the patient was started on once daily Lisinopril 5 mg tablet one tablet p.o. once daily. 
57 y.o. female with hx asthma, CAD, DM II, hypothyroidism, anxiety/agarophobia and depression, who presented to the ED today with SOB and agitation. Patient is unable to provide history as she is intubated at this time. History is obtained from patient's daughter who does not live with the patient. According to the patient's daughter the patient has been in her USOH until a few days ago when she started complaining of SOB initially relieved with Albuterol inhaler. Daughter reports speaking with pt on the phone day prior to admission and pt has not mentioned any complaints to her. Her SOB has been getting progressively worse and this morning she developed increased WOB and had to come in to the ED. In the ED, the patient was noted to have increased WOB and was very agitated. ED initial vitals 98.3 108 207/78 20 100% on NRB and 88% on RAHer lung exam was described as having bilateraly wheezing and crackles. She was given nebs, 125 mg of Solumedrol IV, Levofloxacin for presumed UTI, 5 units of insulin, a total of 3 mg of Ativan and Valium 5 mg for anxiety, and was placed on oxygen. She then was noted to be somnolent and difficult to arouse. Patient was intubated and placed on AC 500x15; peep 5; FiO2 100%. ABG was checked post-intubation and was 7.06/98/374. CXR and CTA done (see below). . Per family, no fevers, chills recently. No cough. No ill contacts. Bloody stools recorded in ED record. Patient's SO reports that she ran out of Levothyroxine x 2 wks recently. . Of note, the patient was recently seen in PCP's office. Her TSH was noted to be 9 and Levothyroxine dose was increased. She was also started on Bactrim for presumed UTI. . Called out to floor on [**2699-5-20**] - patient reports that she is feeling well. SOB is significantly improved, no cough. No chest pain, abdominal pain. Eating well. Urinating without difficulty after removal of foley. 
63F w/ DM, HTN, recent left great toe injury c/b left great toe osteomyelitis s/p OR debridement x2 and distal SFA stenting with course complicated by poor wound healing, [**Last Name (un) **], acute on chronic systolic CHF presents from rehab with AMS. . At baseline, per report and per electronic records, the patient is fully oriented x3. Per EMS report and facility documentation, the patient shortly before arrival became acutely agitated. She also complained of left lower quadrant abdominal pain. The facility gave her 1 mg of morphine IM for this pain. They then realized that she has a documented allergy to morphine, which is altered mental status, no anaphylaxis. The records clearly state that the altered mental status proceeded the morphine administration. She was placed on a nonrebreather mask, though it is not clear if the pt was ever hypoxic. At baseline, she uses 2 L nasal cannula oxygen for her COPD. . Admission from [**Date range (3) 19005**]: # Left great hallux MRSA osteomyelitis: The patient was admitted with a left great hallux ulceration that probed to bone following traumatic injury to her foot.  Wound culture was positive for MRSA, and the patient was started on vancomycin on [**2705-2-13**].  The patient's wound was debrided by podiatry in the OR.  However, she had poor wound healing, and development of dry gangrene at the incision site.  Due to poor wound healing, she underwent ABI/PVRs that showed poor vascular flow to the distal left extremity.  She underwent distal SFA stent placement and was started on prasugrel and aspirin.  The patient was taken back to the OR by podiatry for further toe debridement. Following the second debridement, both clean and dirty margins of bone grew MRSA.  She was seen by infectious disease, who recommended 6 weeks of IV vancomycin for persistent osteomyelitis.  A PICC line was placed.  The patient was discharged on vancomycin.  She should undergo daily dressing changes with betadine, gauze, and Kerlix to foot and ankle.  She should follow up with vascular, infectious disease, and podiatry as an outpatient.  Final clean margin bone pathology pending at discharge. . # Acute on chronic systolic CHF with EF 35%:  The patient developed dyspnea and hypoxia after receiving PRBCs and pre-cath hydration in preparation for angiogram.  Chest X-ray showed pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions. The patient was started on IV diuresis with lasix, and her symptoms improved.  However, at the time of discharge, she still had a mild O2 requirement.  The patient was discharged on lasix 20 mg PO daily.  She was continued on aspirin, carvedilol, simvastatin, and fish oil throughout admission.  The patient is not on an ACEI due to acute kidney injury. . # Acute kidney injury:  Following first OR debridement of osteomyelitis, the patient developed ATN, with muddy brown casts on urine microscopy.  Her creatinine increased from baseline 0.9 to 2.9, and slowly improved to 1.4.  Creatinine remained at 1.4 for remainder of admission.  Medications were renally dosed. . # Anemia:  The patient had progressive anemia during admission, with nadir HCT of 22.  She was found to be guaiac positive, with brown stool.  Prior to vascular procedure, the patient was transfused 3 units PRBCs for cardiac optimization.  Hematocrit remained stable following transfusion.  The patient should follow up with gastroenterology as an outpatient for colonoscopy. . # COPD: Patient with occasional wheezing at baseline.  Has had many COPD exacerbations in the past. The patient was continued on standing ipratropium bromide throughout admission.  Albuterol nebs were increased to q4hrs for increased wheezing in the setting of fluid overload.  If wheezing worsens, may consider increasing frequency of nebs.  Steroids not started during admission, as patient thought to have primary cardiac source of wheeze.  [**Month (only) 115**] consider steroids for short course if respiratory status worsens, but would avoid if possible given MRSA osteomyelitis and wound healing. . In the ED, initial VS were: 98 ??????F (36.7 ??????C), Pulse: 77, RR: 20, BP: 105/46, O2Sat: 100 On arrival, the patient was altered and obtunded. She opened her eyes to voice and answered very short questions, but immediately falls back asleep. She has poor air movement and diffuse 
61 yo with hx of Multiple Myeloma with amyloidosis that has been in remission presented to ED today with few days of urinary symptoms, including increased frequency, hesitancy, dysuria and flank pain.  Initially she wasn't having temps and was trying to get an appt with covering PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] today was spiking temps to T 102-103 and came in to the ED for evaluation.  On arrival here was normotensive with tachycardia BP 139/65 HR 110 then started spiking to T 103.9 and BP [**Last Name (un) 19009**] to 80/50 with leukocytosis, bandemia and positive UA.  Initially she was given levoflox 500mg IV x1 and then after starting sepsis protocol rec'd Ceftriaxone 1gm x1 and Vanc 1gm x1 and 4LNS.  She had a renal ultrasound to r/o hydro. . She overall feels better here in [**Hospital Unit Name 152**], notes also vague abd pain in suprapubic region, but no n/v/d, +decreased appeitite for a few days.  No other localizing symptoms including cough, SOB, CP or sick contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] recent steroid or abx use. . 
The patient is a 45-year-old male who has undergone resection of a synovial sarcoma. He has bilateral pulmonary metastases and has been admitted for left thoracotomy and wedge resection of multiple pulmonary nodules. 
HPI: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with PMH of NIDDM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, CRI (baseline 4.2), who originally presented with 3 days of SOB, PND, and orthopnea  but no weight changes, LE edema, CP, abdominal discomfort, fevers, cough.  Per family, pt had recent hospitalization at Caritas with similar symptoms and was discharged after diuresis.  Patient was compliant with her medications, no dietary indiscretions and no recent weight changes per family.  In ambulance, patient was given 80mgIV lasix. In [**Name (NI) **], pt had SBP of 188/100 and sating 100% on NIPPV, was given additional 40mg IV and started on nitro drip. Foley was placed without urine output and was admitted to the ICU for possibly dialysis and BP control.  In ED, cardiology was consulted and MICU admission suggested as patient did not put out to lasix.  Renal was consulted for possible emergent dialysis and line placement.  Pt and family have been having recent discussions re:dialysis. . Patient was admitted to the MICU for urgent dialysis.  However, patient was diuresed with a lasix drip with diuril priming where she put out 1L/day.  She also was weaned of her O2 requirement. However on [**8-10**], patient HCT dropped from 34  to 25.9. No source of bleeding was found and HCT remained stable. 
80 y/o male with CKD, HF with preserved EF (EF 55%, [**3290-6-29**]), AAA, and history of escape junctional bradycardia with retrograde P-waves that was attributed to excessive AV nodal blockade (Diltiazem) who presents with intermittent palpitations for approximately 4 days, each episode lasting approximately one minute in duration, which the patient describes as a funny feeling in his chest. He had an episode prior to arrival to the ED that had resolved prior to arrival. The patient's wife explicitly stated that he did not complain of chest pain but did have some back pain. The patient's family called EMS when he began expressing chest pain. Per EMS, he was bradycardic to the 30s for which he received Atropine once. He further received Aspirin 81 mg x 4. . Upon arrival to the ED, the patient stated that his chest pain had resolved as above but reported that he felt lightheaded and overall feeling unwell. His HR was noted to be in the 40s with SBPs in the 90s initially. No significant EKG findings other than bradycardia were reported. He was noted to have pulmonary crackles on exam but no other significant physical exam findings were reported. Labs were significant for a K of 5.7, BUN of 39, and serum creatinine 3.4 (up from a recent baseline of 2.0-2.4). He received Calcium gluconate, insulin and D50 for his hyperkalemia, which was later followed by an Albuterol nebs. He received several doses of Atropine (2) as well as Glucagon for reversal of any excess beta-blockade. His systolics were noted to be mostly in the 90s with one episode of hypotension to the high-70s, during which the patient was reportedly asymptomatic. He was subsequently started on Dopamine at 2.5 mg/min. Transfer vitals were HR 47, BP 103/60, RR 14, 93% on 2L. . Of note, his family noted a deterioration in his mental status following either administration of either Atropine or Glucagon. They further stated that he is typically a very organized and oriented individual though they did state that he has poor vision and decreased hearing. . Upoon arrival to the floor, the patient was noted to be delirius and unable to answer quetions. History was obtained via his family. The family believed that he may have been taking older or . 
The patient is a 74-year-old woman, with a complicated medical history which includes a meningioma resection in [**2882**], [**2891**], breast cancer with lumpectomy in [**2893**] and [**2875**] with metastasis to the liver, and an AV fistula that was embolized in [**2894-5-3**] and then again in [**2895**].  The patient is again admitted for repair of AV fistula.  The patient has been complaining of increased occipital pain due to this AV fistula. PHYSICAL EXAM:  She appears her stated age.  She is awake, alert and oriented x 3.  Cardiac is regular rate and rhythm. No murmur, rub or gallop.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, with a midline scar.  Extremities - no clubbing, cyanosis or edema. HOSPITAL COURSE:  She is admitted status post craniotomy and resection of an AV fistula on [**2896-7-3**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1117**].  She underwent suboccipital crani for repair of this AV fistula without intraop complication.  Postop, her vital signs are stable. She is afebrile.  She is awake, alert.  EOMS are full.  Face is symmetric.  Her strength is [**6-6**] in all muscle groups.  Her tongue is midline.  Her dressing is clean, dry and intact. She was in the recovery room overnight.  She remained neurologically stable and was transferred to the regular floor on postop day 1.  She was awake, alert and oriented x 3.  EOMS full.  No drift.  Her strength was full in all muscle groups.  Her dressing was clean, dry and intact. On [**2896-7-6**], the patient's O2 requirements started to increase.  She was 94 percent with a 50 percent face mask. Chest x-ray on [**2896-7-6**] showed worsening left lower lobe opacity which may relate to atelectasis or pneumonia.  The patient also had increase in the left pleural effusion at the time. On [**7-7**], the patient continued to have increasing O2 requirements with shortness of breath.  Her SAT's were 88 percent on room air.  She was following commands and answering all questions.  She did have bibasilar rales.  She was given 10 mg of IV Lasix and had a repeat chest x-ray on [**7-7**] which showed increase in mild CHF with no pleural effusion.  She was treated with Lasix with good diuresis. The patient's respiratory status continued to decline and; therefore, a pulmonary consult was obtained no [**2896-7-10**]. Pulmonary recommended antibiotic coverage for her pneumonia, and due to the patient's complicated allergy history to IV antibiotics, the patient was covered with aztreonam, and then linezolid was added due to risk of MRSA.  The patient's O2 requirements continued to be high.  She was still on the 50 percent face mask with SAT's 92 percent, and then 94 percent on 3 liters, 88 percent on room air.  Chest x-ray continued to show worsening pneumonia, multilobar pneumonia, and pulmonary continued to follow the patient carefully. ID was also involved when on [**2896-7-14**], the patient developed a rash.  ID recommended continuing aztreonam and linezolid for a 14-day course for this complicated pneumonia, and the patient was screened for MRSA.  So far, the MRSA screen has come back negative.  The patient also had a CTA to rule out pulmonary embolism which was negative.  The patient's rash was kind of a papular that comes and goes, usually after her dose of antibiotics.  The ID staff was aware of this, but recommended continuing the IV antibiotics at this time.

This is an 81-year-old male status post TVR and MVR with prolonged intubation postoperatively back in [**Month (only) **], rapid atrial fibrillation, history of loculated right-sided effusion (status post decortication), history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, history of right diaphragmatic history and history of colon cancer and history of prostate cancer who re-presents from [**Hospital 1304**] Hospital with worsening shortness of breath, which has been nonresponsive to Lasix and nebulizers. As per his daughter, the patient was doing fairly well until a few days prior to admission when he developed somnolence around the time of his elective bronchoscopy.  A BAL culture from [**11-7**] was positive for moderate normal flora with moderate growth Serratia marcescens of two species, both sensitive to bactrim.  The patient was subsequently started on Bactrim, however, continued to develop increased somnolence and occasional episodes of nausea and vomiting. During this time, the patient also had >....<of his trachea (date of which is unclear, but as per patient, was approximately four days prior to admission).  He subsequently developed worsening shortness of breath and increased 02 requirement.  He was noted to have a hematocrit drop to 25 and was transfused two units of packed red blood cells in hopes of relieving the patient's dyspnea.  The patient was also given Lasix between transfusions.  It was unclear whether the patient was adequately diuresed or not. On the date of admission, the patient was reportedly on five liters of nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 90%.  An arterial blood gas done at the time was 7.36/63.8/72.  The patient was given additional Lasix and nebulizers without improvement of dyspnea.  The patient complained of increasing orthopnea, shortness of breath, cough productive of yellow sputum and an inability to clear his secretions.  The patient denies fevers, chills, no chest pain, no abdominal pain, no rashes, no pruritus.  The patient does complain of "swelling of his right leg" and states that in the past, this leg has swelled larger than the left leg.   He does not why there is a difference. In the Emergency Department, the patient was given 60 mg of Solu-Medrol and 1 gram of Ceftriaxone.  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he was closely monitored, restarted on digoxin and Lopressor for rapid atrial fibrillation and given frequent chest Physical Therapy, incentive spirometry and suctioning.  He was tried on nasal CPAP, but did not tolerate this at night.  The patient was also volume resuscitated with intravenous fluids and given no steroids as there was no evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. His past hospitalization from [**2997-7-20**] to [**2997-9-13**], the patient was admitted for the elected TVR and MVR with a prolonged postoperative course including rapid atrial fibrillation, volume overload, right-sided loculated effusion, possible Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and an inability to wean from the vent.  The patient had trachea and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placed.  A VATS procedure was done for right-sided effusion and atelectasis as per operative note, which showed blood clot, which was removed.  A decortication was done and re-expansion of right lower lobe was observed.  No tissue was sent for pathology and the patient was sent to [**Hospital1 1304**] for a vent wean.  From [**2997-9-17**] to [**2997-9-21**], the patient was re-admitted from [**Hospital1 1304**] to [**Hospital6 1739**] due to increased sputum productive, low grade fever, increasing vent support.  Sputum grew out Serratia and the patient was given Levaquin and Ceftazidime. On admission, the patient was noted to have a cuff leak which was repaired and bronchoscopy revealed minimal secretions. Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone were discontinued since Serratia was sensitive to Levaquin.  Serratia was thought at that time to have some element of seizure after he was diuresed, however, an echocardiogram done showed a normal ejection fraction. The patient was started on Captopril, Lasix and digoxin with improvement of bilateral effusions.  It was thought he may have had Dressler's syndrome and steroid was added to his regimen at that time.  The patient continued progressive vent wean and went back to [**Hospital1 1304**]. From [**10-10**] to [**10-20**] at [**Hospital1 1304**], the patient continued the vent wean and on [**10-9**], the patient felt rapid atrial fibrillation.  His Captopril was decreased and beta-blocker was added with minimal response.  An 
The patient has been steadily improving since admission.  He is now on day #9 of 10 of the Ceftriaxone for his positive BAL for Serratia and his secretions have greatly decreased and the patient's oxygen requirement has also greatly decreased.  The patient may be fibrillation the patient continues to be on Coumadin, now at 10 mg q.d. to increase his INR above 2.0.  The patient's hematocrit and hemoglobin has been stable throughout the admission.  For aspiration, the patient has had a swallow study on [**2997-11-17**] which he did not pass due to silent aspirations.  The patient will need a follow up video swallow study on [**2997-11-24**] and he will also need Swallow study showed that the patient penetrated into the laryngeal vestibule while swallowing which ultimately results in aspiration and the patient does not cough spontaneously, although is able to clear on que. The patient's latest laboratory data were white count 6.6 on [**2997-11-20**], hematocrit 31.9, INR 2.0, sodium 136, potassium 4.1, magnesium 2.0.  The patient also had an echocardiogram on [**2997-11-17**] which revealed a moderately dilated left atrium, moderately dilated right atrium and normal left ventricular function with an left ventricular ejection fraction of 50 to 55%, normal right ventricle, aortic valve leaflets, mildly thickened, no aortic regurgitation, a bioprosthetic mitral valve with no mitral regurgitation and tricuspid valve leaflets mildly thickened, valve annuloplasty ring present, moderate 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.

Pt was then transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 194**] (extubated, doing well from respiratory standpoint) for pharmacologic stress test.  Other important events in the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] included sputum positive for MRSA (pt now on Vanco) and Hct drop (?unexplained). On admission to [**Name (NI) 194**], pt denies any symptoms at this time; no cp/sob/n/v/f/c; she does not remember much of her course in the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**]/whether she had chest pain at any time.  She does state that she has a cough, non-productive.  Pt transferred to floor for P-mibi and possible intervention based on the results of this test. 
This is a 59 year old female with a history of Stage 4 follicular lymphoma and lung cancer diagnosed in [**2976-4-29**].  Her lymphoma treatment has been very complicated secondary to multiple recurrences.  She has had a left lower lobe resection for lung cancer, Stage 1.  For her lymphoma she underwent total autologous bone marrow transplant in [**2979-11-30**].  She subsequently underwent two rounds of Rituxan in [**2980**] and [**2981**] followed by multiple chemotherapy agents in [**2982**] for recurrences.  The patient has been maintained on Rituxan treatments every three months. She had a computerized tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis earlier this year which showed progression of the disease.  The patient was started on a chemotherapy regimen of Cytoxan, Rituxan and Pentostatin.  Her previous two cycles had complications of severe nausea and vomiting that required hospitalization, so she was admitted for the third cycle of treatment. 
The patient is a 60 year old female with a history of low grade Stage IV follicular lymphoma, status post multiple recurrences auto bone marrow transplant and questionable history of congestive heart failure, who presented from clinic with fever and neutropenia.  She was recently admitted one week prior with increasing neck lymphadenopathy and was treated with CEPP and sent home with p.o. Etoposide and Prednisone.  She had been feeling well and has no complaints.  She denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, neck pain, worsening cough or other symptoms.  Her review of systems was unremarkable.  She did complain of chronic sore throat and a herpetic lesion on her right lip.  The patient came to clinic today for regular follow-up care and it was not an episodic visit.  She was surprised to learn that she was febrile. 
73M w/ hx of critical AS, CAD, PAD and recent NSTEMI with CHF exacerbation last week ([**2571-6-23**] - [**2571-6-26**]) discharged on medical management now returns with complaint of increased SOB. He reports doing well for the first few days after discharge, however he began to experience significant SOB and fatigue with minimal activity. He reports eating Italian sausages and fast food yesterday prior to the development of these symptoms during the day. When going to bed last night, he had difficulty sleeping due to SOB and had to sit up to catch his breath. He ended up spending much of the night sitting up in a chair. At the urging of his wife, he came to the [**Name (NI) **] today for further evaluation and management. On arrival to the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] EKG was performed which noted the presence of LBBB. This is a stable finding in this patient, however a code STEMI was called and he was rushed to the cath lab. On arrival to the cath lab, his EKG was again reviewed and the stable LBBB was noted. He therefore did not undergo catheterization. He is now sent to the floor for a presumed CHF exacerbation and probable consultation with cardiac surgery for expedition of his planned AVR and CABG. He denies any associated chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, increased edema, headache, fevers, vision changes, or other comlaints. 
This is a 55 year-old male with a past medical history significant for rheumatoid disorder characterized as rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed in [**3283-8-2**] and hypercholesterolemia who presented with a nine month history of polyarthritis with a positive [**Doctor First Name **], history of muscle weakness, weight loss, three days of diarrhea, headache and four days of progressive dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea as well as a rash that started four days prior to admission.  When the patient presented to the Emergency Department he was found to be hypertensive with blood pressures of 220s/150s.  He was also found to be in congestive heart failure thought to be secondary to volume overload and acute renal failure.  The patient was given Labetalol intravenous and sublingual nitroglycerin in order to stabilize his blood pressure.  He was also diuresed with intravenous Lasix.  After this regimen the patient appears to be more comfortable, however, was then found to have chain soaks respirations, however, continued to be arousable.  At this point he was intubated for respiratory distress likely secondary to volume overload from his congestive heart failure and acute renal failure.

The patient is a 70-year-old man with coronary artery disease, status post CABG, end stage renal disease on hemodialysis and CHF with an EF of approximately 35% at baseline.  He was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2621-10-2**] after an episode of chest pain and shortness of breath at hemodialysis.  He reportedly had a similar episode on [**2621-9-29**] at hemodialysis.  ECG at that time showed a left bundle branch pattern.  Troponins of 0.17 and 2.01 were obtained.  He was started on Heparin for presumed acute coronary syndrome.  At 6:30 the following morning on [**2621-10-3**] he became diaphoretic and briefly lost consciousness. A code was called at that time and the patient was resuscitated.  He had melena and coffee ground emesis with a hematocrit dropping from 33.5 to 26.9.  He became bradycardic to the 40's, was given Atropine and was intubated.  CK rose to 727 and troponin I of 34 at that time.  An EGD was performed and no ulcer was visualized secondary to not being able to enter the duodenum.  Repeat echo showed an EF of 25% with 3-4+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] was given 6 units of packed red cells, 4 units FFP, started on Levophed for hemodynamic support and transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further management. 
The patient is a 26 year old female with a  past medical history significant for systemic lupus erythematosus, end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, hypertension who presented to the primary care physician on the day of admission with a one month history of shortness of breath, patient reports shortness of breath after walking one flight of stairs.  She also reports paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea.  She denies any chest pain or palpitations.  No bright red blood per rectum, melena, or rashes.  She was sent to the Emergency Department, also for further evaluation. The patient was also noted to have cervical lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly in the primary care physician's office as well.  In the Emergency Department, she was found to have a blood pressure of 210/180.  She was placed on a Labetalol drip and her blood pressure decreased to 180/140.  However, when the Labetalol drip was discontinued, her blood pressure went back up to 200/160.  The patient does report having headaches, in the last couple of weeks.  She, however, denies any visual changes or any focal neurological complaints.  She is not complaining of any abdominal pain either, in the setting of this new hepatomegaly.  She denies any appreciation of scleral icterus, no fevers at home.  The patient had hemodialysis on [**4-28**] without complaint.  The patient also reports being compliant with all her medications. 
Ms [**Known patient lastname 18385**] is a 60 year old female with a hx of DM2, HTN, and CVA who presents with dyspnea x 3 days. Pt states that her symptoms began acutely on Sunday evening when she was lying supine. She stated that she has previously never had similar symptoms. She states that her shortness of breath is worse at night when she lays down and is relieved with sitting up. This AM, she was noted at her PCP's office to be in afib with RVR (140s) and also had TWI in lateral leads that were new. . In the ED, VS were BP 108/72 HR 115 O2sat 95%RA. Given her RVR, patient recieved IV dilt 10mg x 4 and dilt 30mg po. Her HR decreased to the 110s and she remained HD stable during the entire episode. Patient also had SOB and chest pressure in the ED and responded to nitro. In addition, the patient received a dose of cipro for a positive UA, though she denies dysuria. She was also found to be in ARF with a Cr of 1.4 (b/l 0.8) and received 2L of NS. However, her BNP was later found to be significantly elevated to 7600. . Pt was initially admitted to the floor. She was initially rate controlled with PO Metoprolol and IV Lopressor with 1 dose of Diltiazem. In addition a Bedside ECHO done (given low voltage on EKG, ? muffled heart sounds and possible concern for pericardial ffusion)-->showed EF 15% that was new and no evidence of effusion. In addition, her BP remained low 70-80s and thus decision made to transfer to CCU for closer monitoring and inotropic support with dobutamine. . Patient denies having any recent colds, but admits to allergies associated with rhinorrhea and watery eyes. . Denies fever or chills. Admits to nausea and vomiting. No diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No melena or BRBPR. 
The patient is a 46 year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy thought secondary to chronic Lyme disease versus chronic alcohol use with an ejection fraction of approximately 10% with clean coronaries by recent cardiac catheterization, recently discharged from the Cardiology Service following admission with decompensated congestive heart failure who now returns on [**6-24**] with cardiogenic shock.  The patient described a four to five day history of worsening fatigue, dyspnea on exertion and increasing chest pain.  On presentation to the outside hospital on [**Hospital3 **] the patient was hypotensive and tachycardic complaining of 10 out of 10 chest pain.  He subsequently became more hypotensive with administration of nitroglycerin.  He did not respond to morphine. Electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block, which was old.  Laboratory studies were notable for worsening creatinine, hyperkalemia and acidosis. He was treated for a question of an acute coronary syndrome at the outside hospital with a heparin drip, Plavix and intravenous Lopressor.  The patient apparently refused an intrafat balloon pump and placement of a central venous line at the outside hospital.  He was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] that evening where he had his care in the past. On admission the patient was tachycardic and hypotensive again complaining of chest pain.  He had minimal urine output throughout the day.  He was noted to be hyperkalemic to 7.0 and acidotic consistent with a metabolic acidosis.  His liver function tests and CKs were elevated consistent with multi-organ failure in the setting of shock.  Venous access was obtained through a left femoral line.  The patient was started on inotropic support with Dobutamine and pressor support with Dopamine.  The patient was given Kayexalate bicarbonate, insulin and calcium gluconate for hyperkalemia. Heparin drip was discontinued given the patient's persistently elevated INR.  The patient was given one dose of intravenous vitamin K.  We decided not to pursue a internal jugular line and Swan-Ganz placement given his coagulopathy. The following morning the patient did receive one unit of fresh frozen platelets and was taken urgently to the catheterization laboratory where a PA catheter was placed revealing elevated biventricular pressures, clean coronary arteries and a depressed cardiac index consistent with severe cardiogenic shock.  The patient returned from the catheterization laboratory on max dose of three pressors. The patient remained hypotensive to the 60s with maps in the 40s despite the addition of a fourth pressor at max dose. The patient subsequently experienced asystolic arrest on the floor from which he was revived with medications and transcutaneous pacing.  The patient subsequently arrested again after being made DNR/DNI by his family.  The time of death was approximately 2:00 p.m. on [**2679-6-25**].

70 year old male with severe aortic stenosis presents with increased dyspnea on exertion x 1 week. He does report one episode of chest pain which lasted "just a second".  Has baseline leg swelling but unchanged from prior. He called his cardiologist who increased his lasix to 80mg (40mg [**Hospital1 **]). Patient initialy reported to [**Hospital 7100**] hospital. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] given cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is here. He is now being referred to cardiac surgery for evaluation of an aortic valve replacement. 
ICU HPI: 69yoM with h/o DM, CAD s/p CABG, admission from OSH for hyperkalemia and respiratory distress.  He was admitted from his PCP's office to an OSH for evaluation of new pan-cytopenia 2.1>28%<83, acute renal failure and symptoms of fatigue and weakness. He developed worsening oliguric renal failure and new heart failure and was tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-20**] for further workup of renal dysfunction and new pancytopenia. Since transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] it was thought that he was suffering renal failure from ATN in setting of some combination of poor PO intake, hypotension on BP meds and contrast load at OSH. A temporary HD catheter was placed [**6-22**] and he began dialysis. . He has also been evaluated by the hematology service and bone marrow suppression thought likely due to suppression in setting of acute illness but also pending EBV, CMV, parvovirus, SPEP. UPEP negative for monoclonal spike. Hepatitis serologies negative. There was a plan for bone marrow bx. . Of note, his blood cultures have grown out Ampicillin sensitive enterococci, and he had a TTE just yesterday showing a large aortic valve vegetation. He was switched to Ampicillin yesterday. . He's also had a fair amount of anginal-type chest pain and was evaluated by cardiology.  He's had anginal chest pain for quite a while, maybe x2 / month, worsened with exertion and relieved with rest. Denies palpitations. Tonight, his HR increased to the 140s, in sinus, with lateral ST depressions, which resolved with rate control using Metoprolol 5mg IV. This appears to have been going on nightly for several nights according to the floor night resident. He has been getting nitro paste and nebs. . VS on transfer to the floor were: 108/75, 88, 32, 95/4L. On exam on the floor, he has cardiac wheeze. ABG showed 7.4 / 35 / 77 on 4L. He looks well, but has some minor anterior chest pain. . ROS: As above, otherwise negative for SOB, n/v/abd pain/diarrhea, palpitations, dizziness. . Of note, pt was admitted [**12/3186**] with enterococcal UTI, finished 7d course Ampicillin 
69M CAD s/p CABG in [**3172**], DM2, CKD on HD, radiation cystitis complicated by enterococcal UTI ([**1-6**]) and history of enterococcal endocarditis presenting with chest pain and dyspnea on exertion for several weeks responsive to nitroglycerin. He noticed that pain occasionally radiated to bilateral arms. He denies fevers, chills, nausea/vomiting. He also denies PND or orthopnea. Patient was due for outpatient c. cath on Thursday with his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. He was advised to present to the ED given increased frequency and intensity of chest discomfort. He initially presented to OSH and was transferred here due to cardiology care here. He states that the reason why he came today was that he usually uses oxygen at HD sessions, but his doctor told him that he can't do that on a regular basis. It was also ascertained that for the past 3 weeks that he was using [**8-5**] SLNTGs a day for chest discomfort occuring both at rest and with exertion. This represents increased frequency of his symptoms - intensity has been the same. Of note, he also was complained about needing oxygen and subsequently is doing well on 3 L NC. He does endorse some chest congestion now. . In the ED, initial VS: 22:34 0 98.1 91 101/51 18 100% 3L. ECG showed SR at 95 bpm with lateral ST depression and no STEMI. There were some dynamic depressions in V4-V5 while patient was chest pain free on arrival here. OSH labs at 8 PM showing WBC 6.3, Hgb 12.4, Plt 156. Chemistry panel was Na 134, K 3.7, Cl 90, HCO3 30, BUN 35, Cr 2.8 and Glucose 132. Troponin I was 0.03. A bedside ECHO in the ER showed no effusion with an EF of about 40 % with poor lateral squeeze. CXR showed mild volume overload and airspace pulmonary edema. He was guiaic negative on exam. He also did have active chest pain at 11:15 PM relieved by sublingal nitroglycerin. A repeat ECG did showed worsening depression in V3 and improved in V5. The attending cardiologist assessed him in the ER, recommended heparin infusion and nitroglycerin infusion given frequent chest discomfort. Initial labs showed Cr 3.4 (HD patient), anion gap 22, TropnT 0.04. Hgb was 12.3 near baseline. VS on transfer were: 105/49, 88, 18, 100% 3L nc

78 M with history of CAD s/p BMS to LAD in [**2884**] presenting from [**Hospital3 3534**] with STEMI. Mr [**Known patient lastname 18449**] reports that he was in his usual state of health until the night of admission, when he developed sudden back pain and a feeling of "being squeezed by two linebackers" when he woke up to use the bathroom. (+) Diaphoresis, nausea, no syncope or light-headedness. This pain was then associated with right arm tingling, all the same as his presenting symptoms in [**2884**]. He has not had any anginal episodes since his last stent placement 12 years ago. At [**Hospital1 46**], patient was initially treated as NSTEMI then developed into anterior STEMI. Started on heparing gtt, integrillin gtt and given ASA and Plavix. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], in cath lab found to have TO RCA, unable to cross with wire and felt to be chronic given the lack of ECG changes to the inferior segment. Had tight LAD which was stented with 2 BMS with restoration of good flow. Of note he developed a large groin hematoma after femoral puncture with extravasation of contrast under fluoro; femoral stop placed with successful cessation of oozing. Transferred to CCU for further management. On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. Hhe denies exertional buttock or calf pain. Of note, patient has dental procedures scheduled in the near future. Also, he has develped a rash in his back for which he was started on Prednisone 60mg daily for approximately one week. All of the other review of systems were negative.

This is an 82 year old man status post three vessel CABG in [**3215**] (SVG to LAD, SVG to OM2, SVG to PDA) who presented to [**Hospital 1456**] Hospital on [**3235-8-30**] with one week history of exertional chest pressure which occurred only at night, nonradiating.  Chest pressure nausea, vomiting.  It was unlike symptoms of prior MI.  Chest pressure was relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.  Patient initially did not want to go for further workup, but was urged by wife and granddaughter to go to the hospital.  At [**Hospital1 1456**] he was ruled out with negative cardiac enzymes (peak CK 96, troponin less than 0.3).  At [**Hospital1 1456**] he attempted an exercise treadmill test, however, patient was unable to walk refused, therefore, he was taken to cardiac catheterization on [**3235-9-3**].  The catheterization showed 90% left main LAD which was totally occluded, left circumflex which was totally occluded, RCA which had a 90% mid-lesion, SVG to LAD graft was 90% occluded, SVG to OM2 was totally occluded, SVG to PDA was also totally occluded.  He was then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for percutaneous intervention.  Cath here showed RCA with 70% proximal, 80% mid and distal occlusion, elevated filling pressures (cardiac index 4.1, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16, RA 12).  RCA was stented in two locations with 0% residual.  Cardiac catheterization, however, was complicated by microperforation which was treated with perfusion balloon inflation.  Effective hemostasis was achieved in the cath lab and a TTE was done which showed only a small pericardial effusion.  He was then sent to the CCU for hemodynamic monitoring.

He was found to have a troponin of 76.3, a creatine kinase of 501, and a CK/MB of 20.8.  The patient was given a heparin bolus, and the decision was made to transfer the patient to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization.  At that time, the heparin was discontinued and the patient was started on Integrilin. Other laboratories from the outside hospital included a potassium of 3.9, creatinine of 1.4, and a hematocrit of 39. His arterial blood gas at the outside hospital was 7.46/38/69 on 3 liters nasal cannula.  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at approximately 110 beats per minute.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10799**] reports that for the past 3-4 days he has been noting mild cough productive of white sputum. He has also noticed that his blood pressure, which is baseline systolic was 80 systolic today. He did feel light headeded but denies loss of consciousness or neausea. He denies any respiratory distress, fevers, urinary symptoms, focal pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, or other localizing symptoms. Baseline exercise tolerance is ~1 block and unchanged recently. Baseline 1-pillow orthopnea is also unchanged. He does endorse slight increase in chronic LE edema . In the ED, initialy VS: BP 60/44, O2 90% RA in triage, but first set of VS in core BP 121/101, RR 19, HR 72, T 98.3. He was given 1.5L NS. CXR did not demonstrate any significant change from prior. Exam was without localizing features apart from an elevated JVP. LIJ was placed and norepinephrine started. Vancomycin 1 g and zosyn 4.5 g were also administered as well as 10 mg dexamethasone. Urine and blood cultures were sent. Bedside echo demonstrated global hypokinesis, thought to be similar to prior. EKG showed ST depressions in v3-v6 and new QW in II, new from prior. Labs were notable for trop elevated above baseline but no CK elevation. Cardiology was consulted. They felt that this was either demand ischmia or a missed cardiac event. They recommended Plavix and [**Known patient lastname **], which were given, but no heparinization unless CK became elevated. Subsequent EKGs were unchanged.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10799**] is a 54yo M w/hx ESRD with failed tx on PD, DM-I, CAD, CHF with EF ~15% who presents to the ED with hypotension.  He "thinks" that he took too much off with PD at home today but cannot quantify exact amount. He states he usually takes off 1500ml but knows it was a lot higher than this number. . Of note, he was recently admitted [**Date range (2) 19232**] for cellulitis and abscess of the R thigh which was I&D'd on [**4-28**].  He was treated initially with Vanc/Unasyn, then changed to Unasyn when cultures came back with MSSA.  He was discharged on Augmentin for a further 10 day course to end [**2866-5-13**]. . In the ER, initial vitals were T98.6F, HR 74, BP 70/37, RR 17 and oxygen sat 99% RA.  Blood pressures dropped to 56 systolic and he was given 2L NS and systolics came up to 70s-80, so he was placed on peripheral dopamine.  He was given vanc/zosyn in the ED for broad coverage, with particular concern for cellulitis spread / abscesses in legs. Renal was consulted and will plan to follow patient as inpatient. His PD fluid was sent for culture and cytology.  Cell count from the PD fluid showed 50 WBCs and 9% polys.  ECG showed ST depressions anterolaterally which are similar to prior ECGs.  He had a central line placed for access to continue monitoring hemodynamics and for easy pressor use. . On evaluation in the MICU, patient was very lethargic and attention waxed and waned during exam. He seemed to be in no acute distress or pain. Arrived with right IJ in place and was on dopamine pressor with blood pressures stable at 118/67. 
This is a 62 year old male with history of significant CAD with CABG in [**2921**] and PTCI in [**2937**] as well as chronic systolic CHF and episodes of ventricular tachycardia s/p AICD placement in [**2936**] who presented tonight after an ICD firing.  Per the patient he has been feeling a bit off for about a month now with occasional episodes of dizziness and palpitations with standing. Over the fast five days, however, this has been considerably worse.  He reports every time he stands up suddenly or exerts himself  he will feel palpitations and get light-headed though he can breathe out hard and will feel this go away.  he has never lost consciousness, he just feels weak and generally very unwell when this happens.  He has no chest pain associated with this.  The patient received a defibrillator shock from his ICD at around 10:00 pm on [**2940-1-17**] and presented to the emergency room soon afterward. . In the ED, he was noted to go into intermittent episodes of VT with overdrive pacing and vagal maneuvers quickly leading to a reversion to sinus rhythm.  He remained hemodynamically stable. He was started on an amiodarone IV load and admitted to the cardiology service.  After arrival to the cardiology service the patient had multiple episodes of VT terminating similar to the events in the ED.  Thus, he is transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for palpitations and presyncope as noted.  It is also notable for the presence of chronic dyspnea on exertion related to asthma without lower extremity edema, orthopnea, or PND.  He denies chest pain of syncope. 
This is a 62 year old white male with significant medical history status post cadaver renal transplant in [**3345-3-3**] with known peripheral vascular disease, bilateral common iliac stentings in [**3348-2-1**] with re-angioplasty of the right common iliac in [**3350-1-3**] who developed gangrene of the right toes due to a burn from a heating pad two months prior to admission.  The patient had a preoperative cardiology evaluation and had a positive P valve study.  He underwent cardiac catheterization and lower extremity arteriograms.  He had an angioplasty with stent to the left circumflex on [**3350-1-29**].  This was followed by 30 days of Plavix.  The patient now returns for right lower extremity bypass.  He denies rest pain or claudication. ALLERGIES:  Biaxin and Penicillin which causes nausea and vomiting. 
75 yo female with PmHx of DM, asthma, HTN, hyperlipidemia who presented from her [**Hospital3 **] home [**2-3**] with respiratory distress.  On admission, she was found to have an O2 sat of 85% on RA, and was given nebs/IV lasix.  Her initial ABG was 7.12/47/152/16 with lactate of 8, and CPAP was initially begun in the ED.  She was noted to be bradycardic, with a ?junctional escape rhythm at a rate of 48 bpm in the setting of hyperkalemia (K=7), and was given atropine.  However, she subsequently became hypotensive, was started on dopamine, and was electively intubated.  Of note, several medications were apparently changed [**1-30**] by her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 19302**] initiation of Cardtia XT 300mg daily, with discontinuation of nifedipine.  ED course also notable for empiric initiation of levofloxacin, vancomycin, flagyl, and hydrocortisone. Micu course notable for resolution of her hyperkalemia, which was thought to be secondary to a combination acute on chronic renal failure and [**Last Name (un) **] toxicity, with resolution of normal sinus rhythm (rate in the 70s), and pressors were waned off on hospital day one.  Her renal function improved, with Cr 1.4 the morning of MICU transfer to the floor (baseline 0.8 - 1.2).  She was successfully extubated [**2-6**], though required intermittent noninvasive ventilation for hypercarbia thought to be secondary to combination of sedative medications and poor baseline respiratory status.  She also was noted to be febrile, and was treated empirically for possible MRSA pneumonia (sputum cultures positive for MRSA), with defervescence on [**2-3**]. Furthermore, discussion with outpatient psychiatrist revealed that patient has atypical reaction (extreme agitation/?psychosis) to midazolam, which may have contributed to her altered mental status during weaning period.  She was also noted to have hypernatremia, which was thought to be secondary to crystalloid given during initial fluid resuscitation in the setting of acute renal insufficiency.  Her hypernatremia improved with free water repletion. PMHx: HTN, DM II with neuropathy/nephropathy, asthma, increased lipids, ?parkinsonism, paranoid schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obesity, osteoarthritis, GERD, BPD, Diabetic neuropathy, R TKR, Anemia, CRI.  Diverticulitosis.  ?hepatic cyst, S/p right total knee replacement ([**2849**]).

His last BM was yesterday and had bright red blood in it.  He says his stools are always dark given that he takes iron.  He also states that over the weekend last week, he was admitted to an OSH for anemia and was given a blood transfusion and sent home.  He did not have an endoscopy or colonoscopy.  Of note, he also is carrying a prescription for levoquin for an unknown reason.  He doesn't know why he is supposed to be taking it.  He denies fainting, falling, abdominal pain.  He has never had a colonoscopy or endoscopy before.  He does not take NSAIDs, drink etoh or have a hx of ulcers of GERD like symptoms. . In the ED, initial vitals were afebrile, P 70, BP 130/90, R 24 and 98% on 2L.  He was guiac positive with bright red blood on the rectal exam.  He had a NGL that returned bile without blood. His vital signs were stable throughout his ED course.  He had one 18g and one 16g PIV placed.  GI evaluated him in the emergency room and requested a nuclear red blood tagged scan this evening.  He did receive 2 units of blood in the ED for a hct of 22.1. . On arrival to the floor, he is feeling well.  He complains of a headache, but otherwise has no complaints. 
84M with advanced dementia, atrial fibrillation, CHF (EF 25%), BPH presenting from rehab with acute renal failure and urinary tract infection/hematuria. He was noted to have an increase of creatinine from 1.2 to 2.6. He was started on a cefepime for a proteus urinary tract infection diagnosed on [**2564-8-14**]. He had an ultrasound on [**2564-8-13**] that showed hydronephrosis. Of note, he is confused at baseline but seems more agitated recently. He has no documented fevers. He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, vomiting. In addition, patient was admitted from [**2564-6-29**] to [**2564-7-5**] for confusion x 1 days and noted to have a congestive heart failure exacerbation. Cardiology evaluation and consultation advised medical management and ECHO showed wall motion abnormalities consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease. He was also noted that have a 3 month cognitive decline, which was corroborated with his wife and [**Hospital 225**] health care proxy [**Name (NI) **]. In the ED, initial VS were: Triage 12:51 0 99.5 74 92/66 16 92% He was noted to have a foley with purulent red urine. His was AAOx1 and very lethargic (said "yes" to some questions) - he has been like this for past 4 weeks per wife. [**Name (NI) **] does have history of attacking people at rehab. Current access includes left PICC and 18G on right arm. He was given cefepime at 11:30 AM today and vancomycin 1gm IV in [**Hospital1 18**] ER. His initial SBP was in the 90s, which then dropped to the 80s. He was given 250 mL normal saline with SBP 100-110s. Labs were performed - Lactate 2.4 - cTropnT 0.05 - Na 141, Cl 105, K 3.6, HCO3 20, BUN 55, Cr 3, Glc 95 - ALT 31, AST 97, ALP 97, Lipase 12, tbili 0.8, Alb 3.4 - WBC 25.2, Hgb 13.4, Plt 171 Diff N 93.8 L 3.3 INR 1.5 - UA Cloudy, pH 9, Tbili Lg, LE Lg, Nit Pos, Prot > 300, Glu > 1000, Ket 150, RBC > 182, WBC > 182, Bacteria None A prelim CT Abd showed no renal stones, discrepancy in renal size (11cm right, 7.4cm left) likely reflects chronic kidney disease. Moderate perinephric stranding is consistent with pyelonephritis in the appropriate clinical setting, which appears worse on the right. A foley is present within the bladder, which is decompressed. A recently passed stone could also account for these findings although none is seen. In addition, there was moderate cardiomegaly. Overall, this scan is limited by lack of contrast and respiratory motion, but no other significant abnormalities are detected. Blood and urine cultures were obtained; however, patient did receive antibiotics before arrival at rehab. He is being admitted to the ICU for sepsis with hemodynamic changes including tachycardia in 110-120s and relative SBP 90s. On arrival to the MICU pt had an episode of pulseless VTACH, spontaneously converted. he was dyspneic and received IV metop 5mg x 1 for RVR, lasix 20 IV, IV morphine. Review of systems: 
76 year old female with diabetes, hypothyroidism, GERD, and hyperlipidemia admitted to [**Hospital1 **] with diarrhea, fatigue, bright red blood per rectum and bilateral lower extremity edema on [**3147-2-25**]. History per records as difficult for patient to communicate while on BIPAP. . Initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**3147-2-25**] with rectal bleeding, low back pain, and shortness of breath.  Was previously hospitalized in [**Month (only) 1082**] with diverticulitis and positive blood cultures ([**5-12**]) for Strep viridans, sensitive to penicillins.  Following that hospitalization, she was sent home on ciprofloxacin.  Since discharge, over the course of [**Month (only) 1082**] and [**Month (only) 400**], she has had symptoms of continued malaise, poor appetite, and weight loss of about 10 lbs over the past couple months.  She has been sleeping often and has had low energy. One week prior to [**Hospital1 **] admission, she had diarrhea and noted bright red blood in stool.  Two days prior to [**Hospital1 **] admission, she admitted to worsening shortness of breath, leg swelling, and family noted increasing lethargy and confusion.  She presented to [**Hospital3 **] with these complaints.  Blood cultures drawn on [**2-25**] grew out an alpha hemolytic strep species with final culture data pending.  She was placed empirically on IV ceftriaxone.  She was not febrile during her hospital stay and felt symptomatically improved after antibiotics were started. An echo done at [**Hospital1 **] revealed aortic stenosis but no vegetation or vavulopathy was noted.  Stool was tested given diarrhea history but this was negative for clostridium difficile.   Her laboratory analysis was remarkable for creatinine of 2 with baseline of 0.6; her white count peaked at 11,600. . On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 19225**] is a pleasant, 74 year-old woman with multiple medical problems, presenting from an outside hospital with a one week history of 8 out of 10 right upper quadrant pain, fever, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea. At an outside hospital, the patient was noted briefly to be in atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate in the 130s to 150s. At the outside hospital, the patient was also noticed to have guaiac positive, black, tarry stools, hematocrit of 37 and mildly elevated LFTs with Total bilirubin of 4.2.  INR at outside hospital was 4.02.  She was given 10 mg of Vitamin K subcutaneously.  On initial presentation, she denied any reports of chest pain, shortness of breath or back pain.  Her belly was soft. She has passed flatus.  Temperature at outside hospital was 99.1, 100.9 by EMS.  Per report of the patient, she has been febrile to 101 for the past 2 days prior to the initial presentation. 
This is a 73 year old Russian gentleman who presented to the Clinic with a diagnosis biopsy proven of adenocarcinoma of the right main stem.  Per his report he had been diagnosed and treated in the Soviet [**Hospital1 1266**] for a right lung cancer 25 years ago.  He has received a significant amount of radiation therapy and chemotherapy.  Patient also has had a known partial collapse and consolidation of the right lung for the past several years and increasing shortness of breath for the past six months.  He has scoliotic spine and a significantly reduced right lung capacity.  He is a very active gentleman.  He is able to walk for one to two hours every day. 
73year old man with history of right non-small cell lung ca s/p pneumonetctomy, COPD, hypertension, sick sinus syndrome s/p [**First Name3 (LF) 4388**] and ICD placement, BPH, and depression presenting with shortness of breath.  The patient had been admitted [**3362-2-9**] with dyspnea.  Extensive work up at that time included cardiac catheterization which showed total occlusion of RCA, although no intervention was done.  At that time, it was felt his symptoms were multifactorial with contributions from his COPD and left sided pleural effusion.  He underwent thoracentesis on [**3362-3-10**]; 1300cc bloody fluid was drained.  Cytology was negative, however, given patient's history, it was still presumed to be malignant.  Pt subsequently discharged to home. . He presented to the ED [**3362-3-15**] with dyspnea and hypoxia, initially on a 100% non-rebreather, with oxygen saturation in the 60%'s.  He was subsequently intubated and started on empiric antibiotics for a suspected pneumonia.  He also became hypotensive after receiving sedation for intubation and was transiently on pressor support. . He was admitted to teh MICU.  He remained intubated with difficulty to wean from ventilator.  This was again thought to be multifactorial, secondary to multifocal pneumonia, persistent pleural effusion, COPD and poor pulmonary reserve s/p lobectomy. . He was treated with a 7 day course of meropenem ([**Date range (1) 19379**]) for a multifocal pneumonia.  He underwent repeat thoracentesis to r/o empyema/help improve respiratory status, which revealed a chylous effusion thought to be due to disruption of thoracic duct during his lobectomy in [**3361-8-12**].  A chest tube was placed with persistent output.  On [**3362-3-23**], chest tube was changed from suction to wet seal.  The patient was started on TPN which theoretically will decrease chylothorax.  He was continued on inhalers for treatment of his COPD. . The chylous effusion was followed by the pulmonary team, who recommended the patient be kept NPO and be treated with 2weeks of TPN.  Repeat CT showed persistant output.  As a result, thoracic surgery was consulted and performed a mechanical pleurodesis. In the SICU, the patient developed a respiratory acidosis and was intubated and extubated on [**3362-4-6**]. . SICU course was also notable for complicated left subclavian central venous access attempt with cannulation of the subclavian artery resulting in signficant bleeding and requiring vascular consultation.  Follow-up ultrasound did not show aneurysm/fistula formation. . On admission the patient was also noted to have a left scapular wound infection, persistent since his lobectomy in [**Month (only) **], [**3360**].  He was seen by plastic surgery, who recommended treatment with oxacillin which was discontinued.  There were no plans for further surgery by the plastics team.   He continued to have wound care addressed by the wound care service.

She was at a scheduled outpatient CT scan, where she appeared short of breath and complained of dyspnea, which was significantly worsened when the patient lied flat on the CT scanner table. She has had steadily worsening dyspnea over the last 2-3 weeks, which has occasionally been accompanied by a productive cough. She was referred to the ED, where her triage SpO2 was reported as 50% and her RR was in the 40s. She was initially unresponsive, but her oxygen saturation and her mental status improved with a non-rebreather and nebulizer treatments. She had a chest x-ray that was reportedly concerning for pneumonia. She was given vancomycin, pip/tazo, azithromycin, and furosemide 80 mg IV. ID was consulted, and recommended obtaining urine legionella, bacterial/fungal blood cultures, sputum gram stain & culture, influenza swab, and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]. . On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**], the patient reports that her dyspnea is significantly improved since this afternoon. She reports that her dyspnea had been worsening over the past 2-3 weeks, and she has also had an occasional wheeze for the past one week. She has also had worsening bilateral ankle edema over that same period of time. She denies coughing, hemoptysis, chest pain or pressure, fevers, chills, sweats, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel or bladder habits. She also reports she had a similar episode last [**Month (only) 115**], for which she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]. Discharge summary indicates that she was treated with diuresis and levofloxacin, for CAP.

On ROS, she endorses pain with palpation of her chest, shoulders, back, and abdomen. 
This is a 69-year-old female with a past medical history of biventricular failure status post AV pacer placement on [**2833-5-7**] and congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15% and chronic renal insufficiency who awoke at 6 a.m. with 10/10 chest pain radiating to her abdomen that gave her nausea and great distress.  The patient presented to the Emergency Department on [**5-30**] and was given sublingual nitrogen x3 with a decrease in base to 5 from 10.  She received Lopressor, aspirin and 2 liters oxygen by nasal cannula.  The patient's pain was reproducible by palpation below the pacemaker placement site and with deep inspiration.  The patient experienced nausea and vomiting one time in the Emergency Department for which she was given droperidol.  The patient was checked for fingersticks and her glucose was 155.  The patient vomited one more time in the Emergency Room and the patient continued to report pain with deep inspiration. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is an 88 year-old male with a PMHx significant for aortic stenosis (peak/mean gradient 60/32 mm HG in [**3103-7-19**]), CHF with EF 35% in [**3103-7-19**], chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin therapy, DM type 2, hypertension and MDS with anemia and thrombocytopenia, transferred from NH for further evaluation of "worsening CHF". Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was recently D/C'd from [**Hospital1 18**] after admission for ARF and dehydration felt [**1-20**] overdiuresis. During this admission and at discharge, Metoprolol D/C'd (was on 50 mg PO BID), Lasix decreased to 40 mg PO BID, Zaroxylyn D/C'd, Aldactone D/C'd, Quinine D/C'd. Per NH notes, patient noted to have increasing pulmonary crackles 3 days PTA and was given an additional 80 mg PO of Lasix. Worsening pulmonary crackles were noted this AM, and patient received an additional Lasix 40 mg IV X 1 in addition to usual 80 mg PO. 4 lbs weight gain noted over weekend. Vitals BP 98/58, HR 73, RR 22, sat 100% on room air. Patient denies any C/P. He also denies worsening SOB, but reports a congested chest. Stable 2-pillow orthopnea, no PND. Stable lower extremity swelling. Mild cough, non-productive. No rhinorrea, no sore throat. He received his flu shot this year. No fever/chills. No N/V, no diaphoresis, no abdominal pain.

The patient is an 83 year old female with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, recently discharged from the hospital earlier this month, who was brought to the Emergency Room from rehabilitation with abdominal pain, fevers and hypoxia. The patient was recently transferred to rehabilitation, where she had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed. After the PEG tube was placed, there was note of abdominal discomfort.  The abdominal discomfort occurred for more than 48 hours after the PEG tube was placed.  She also noted some diarrhea as well. The patient had previously been at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3811**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], treated for pneumonia amongst multiple medical issues.  Upon arrival to the Emergency Room, the patient was found to have free air under the diaphragm on an x-ray, but this was thought to be secondary to the PEG tube placement, no surgical process was noted on CT scan. The patient was noted to be hypoxic with a 90% oxygen saturation on a nonrebreather, and was taken to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and treated for a multi-focal pneumonia. She was treated with levofloxacin, vancomycin and Flagyl. The patient was not intubated in the Intensive Care Unit. She was also treated with Solu-Medrol for a pulmonary process.  It was thought either to be infectious pneumonia versus chronic lymphocytic leukemia infiltrate versus congestive heart failure.  The patient's oxygen requirement decreased and she was transferred to the medical floor. 
The patient is a 61-year-old male who initially presented to the podiatry service after an elective triple arthrodesis of the right foot.  He was initially admitted for pain control and was placed on clindamycin postoperatively.  He initially did well, but began to develop some low blood pressures into the systolic 90s, which initially responded to IV fluid boluses.  These low blood pressures continued with systolics into the 70s-80s, which required several liters of fluid.  He also developed a temperature to 101, at which time blood cultures were obtained which revealed [**3-5**] positive blood cultures with gram-positive cocci.  He also, at that time, had increasing creatinine with a peak of 2.6, and began to develop a new oxygen requirement.  He was 92% on 2 liters nasal cannula. He also developed some diarrhea, as well as some mental status changes, and was thought to be encephalopathic.  The medical consult resident was [**Name (NI) 647**], and the patient was then transferred to the medical team.

74 y/o female with a h/o MMP who was recently diagnosed with non-small cell lung CA who was scheduled for cycle 2 of carboplatin/taxol (cycle 1 on [**1-4**]) when she presented on [**3309-1-27**] with worsening SOB X 2 weeks. Per patient, has had increased DOE since late [**Month (only) 1082**]. Usually walks one hour, but now can only walk 40 min and feels more SOB than normal. + orthopnea, no PND, no LE edema. She was seen in clinic for a scheduled visit to start second cycle of chemo on [**1-28**] and was found to have O2 sats of 78% with aggressive ambulation. She felt more SOB during this episode than usual, but not as badly as prior CHF exacerbations. She was sent down for imaging and CTA was negative and she went home with O2. That evening she was sipping tea and choked (has been choking on liquids since thyroid CA in [**3251**]'s). The next day she presented to ED with worsening SOB that was now occurring at rest but denied CP, fevers, chills, change in cough, or sputum production. In the ED, the patient's O2 sat was 93% on a NRB. CXR demonstrated RLL PNA and she was treated for a pneumonia and presumed CHF. She received ceftaz, azithromycin, lasix (680cc diuresed) and morphine. She was also started on BiPAP for presumed CHF exacerbation which helped. She was transferred to the MICU where she improved daily and the team felt that the largest contributor to acute SOB was PNA. An ECHO was obtained in setting of CABG and AVR which was unchanged from [**3-29**] except from increasing pulm HTN (possibly likely combination of lung CA, diphragmatic paralysis, h/o XRT when tx'd for thyroid CA). She is being tranferred to the OMED service because shy in no longer MICU level of care. She was sating high 90's on [**2-24**] L upon transfer. . Currently the patient's breathing is comfortable and she denies CP, palpatations. Cough is improving, nonproductive. No URI sxs. Has been eating a lower sodium diet and taking all of her medications regularly. She has had an 8 lb weight loss in 2 months d/t decreased appetite. Also had myalgias as well as numbness/tinging in toes, feet, hands, knees, calves during neulasta treatment, all currently resolved. . ROS: No fatigue, malaise, fevers, chills, N/V/abd pain/D/C/dysuria/sensory or motor loss. + nose bleed during chemo. 
74F w/ with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung CA who was seen in clinic on the day prior to admission with epistaxis, fatigue and oral ulcers. She reports that she has epistaxis frequently, but that it was much worse than usual, (dripping blood, used 3 boxes of kleenex, passing several clots). She reports the fatigue is stable x 3 weeks. Oral ulcers/inflammation of her lips has been present x 2 weeks; it is uncler if this is due to HSV vs a side effect of chemo. She received a platelet transfusion and was started on acyclovir (for presumptive oral HSV). . The patient returned to clinic in follow up on the day of admission; she was found to be febrile to 100.4 with neutropenia. She was therefore transferred to OMED for direct admission.

Ms [**Known patient lastname **] is a 60 year old woman with coronary artery disease, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in [**3086-10-24**] with left circumflex stent, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen, history of severe anxiety who presented to the Emergency Room with dyspnea on exertion over the past one to two weeks.  Per the patient's family she has not been taking her Lasix for several weeks after a recent psychiatric admission, discharge recommendations do not include this medication.  Per family, the patient also has been suffering from one week of cough, productive of sputum.  Her anxiety has significantly worsened and she was then treated with Xanax for her symptoms.  On the day of admission, in addition to her progressive shortness of breath she also experienced palpitations.  After the call to Emergency Medical Technicians she was transferred to the [**Hospital6 643**] with respiratory rate of 28 to 32, initially 94 to 97% on 3 liters of nasal cannula with a pulse of 130, blood pressure 140/90.  Over the course of the evening in the Emergency Room the patient saturations fell, requiring nonrebreather and eventually bypass. 
This is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems including recurrent arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 30% who was referred by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for APF/LV mapping/biventricular ICD.  He was scheduled for the pacemaker ICD placement in effort to enhance synchrony of his cardiac function and to capture an element of atrial kick, as well. He had the procedure done on [**2774-2-26**] which was complicated by approximately 400 cc blood loss and hypotension which ultimately responded to fluid boluses and Dopamine drip.  He was noted to have a drop in hematocrit and, in light of hypotension, he was monitored in the CCU after his procedure. In the holding area a quick TTE was done showing no effusion. Initially he had been monitored on the floor, but blood pressures were 60s/30s despite Dopamine.  His hematocrit trended from mid 30s to 27.4, and he was started on one unit packed red cells and admitted to the CCU.  He denied back pain, groin pain, chest pain, shortness of breath. 
Pt is a 63 yo male with a h/o Type II DM, CAD s/p 4v CABG [**3137**] and Ulcerative Colitis who p/w fever/chills/NS/weight loss and enlarging peri-portal lymph nodes on abdominal CT concerning for a new diagnosis of lymphoma. . Pt was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 19701**]/07 for abdominal pain, fevers, and weight loss of 20 pounds in the last year, and in the work-up was found to have multiple enlarging lymph nodes on abdominal CT, the largest being a 1.6cm peri-portal LN. Pt was discharged [**12-13**] and saw Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 566**] in GI on [**12-15**], who felt the LAD was less likely infection, and more likely lymphoma, especially if the fever persisted on antibiotics. The pt was supposed to have an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] this AM, but came to the ED because he was feeling weak, tired and febrile at home. Now admitted to the BMT service to expedite work-up for lymphoma. . Of note, pt was also admitted from [**Date range (1) 19702**] for hyperglycemia to 900s, thought to be [**1-9**] non-compliance with insulin [**1-9**] low PO intake [**1-9**] N/V thought to be [**1-9**] diabetic gastroparesis. . Currently pt has no pain at rest. He notes that he has had chest "discomfort" for weeks, which correlates to when he gets his fevers. The pain is non-radiating, feels like a pressure and is worse with inspiration. Pain/fever gets better with tylenol. No positional/food relationship to pain, but when he coughs, he gets the pain. His cough is non-productive and has been relatively stable over the last few weeks. The pain and coughing was very intense overnight, which brought him into the ED this AM. . He also notes occasional epigastric discomfort that is also not related to food/position/chest pain/fevers that he has also had for weeks but goes away on its own. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 63 year-old gentleman with recently diagnosed anaplastic T-cell lymphoma status post 1 cycle of CVP with radiographic improvement, also with a history of DM type 2 and CAD status post CABG in [**3137**] and recent NSTEMI, who presents from rehab with fever. He was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] following a prolonged hospitalization during which the diagnosis of anaplastic T-cell lymphoma was made in the setting of clinical B symptoms and periportal lymphadenopathy, confirmed on lymph node biopsy. His hospital course was further complicated by a troponin leak consistent with probable NSTEMI with new WMA on echo and systolic dysfunction. He had persistent fevers which improved following chemotherapy, presumed secondary to lymphoma. Other events of note included spontaneous bilateral retroperitoneal bleeds (while on anticoagulation) with a requirement for transfusional support (required about 17U PRBC). He was discharged on [**3153-2-3**], and seen in follow-up on [**3153-2-10**] with plan to pursue [**Hospital1 **] next week. A CT scan showed radiographic response. . He now returns with fever and hypoxia at [**Hospital1 **] (88% RA, T-102.5). Workup in the ED showed bilateral pna (was given vanc/levo/flagyl), and he was febrile to as high as 103.9. In this setting, he had a troponin leak to 1.04 (with no ischemic EKG changes, no symptoms). Cardiology was consulted and felt that this was likely demand in the setting of pna; they did not recommend anticoagulation with heparin given recent RP bleed (recommended ASA +/- Plavix). He was given some IVF (2.5 L), but was intermittently tachycardic with fevers so was admitted to the ICU for closer monitoring. SBP remained stable (90-100s) throughout. . Currently, he denies any symptoms, stating that he feels fine. Specifically, he has no dyspnea, no cough, no chest pain, no palpitations, no dysuria, no hematuria, no nausea/vomiting, no diarrhea

The cells expressed CD33 along with dim CD4 and dim CD19. Cells were negative for CD34 and HLA-DR. [**Last Name (STitle) 20011**] were negative for other myeloid markers including CD13, CD14, CD15, CD41, CD64, glycolphorin, CD17. Immunophenotyping findings were consistent with involvement by acute myeloid leukemia with a peripheral smear revealing cup-like nuclei. Cytogenetics were notable for FLT3 and NPM positivity. Echocardiogram showed a left ejection fraction of greater than 65%. Because of her high white count, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 20010**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1811**] leukophoresis and initially received hydroxyurea. On [**3387-1-11**], she was initiated on 7 and 3 induction regimen with idarubicin and ara-C. Her course was complicated by fever and neutropenia. She also was noted for a drop in her ejection fraction to 20-25% on [**3387-1-28**], which was felt due to anthracycline use. She has been managed medically initially with spironolactone, furosemide, lisinopril, and metoprolol and is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 444**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NP as an outpatient. She is currently on spironolactone, furosemide, diovan, and metoprolol. Her lisinopril was discontinued due to cough which has since resolved. Ms. [**Known patient lastname 20012**] course was complicated by her deconditioning and depression regarding her diagnosis and conditioning. She was followed by psychiatry while an inpatient and was discharged on [**3387-2-14**] to [**Hospital1 **] House Rehabilitation in order to improve her strength before moving forward with further therapy. Her cardiomyopathy also limited her ability to receive further chemotherapy. As an outpatient, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 20010**] was noted for a drop in her platelet count. She had noted a superficial saphenous vein clot and was started on Lovenox approximately two weeks prior to this. Her Lovenox had been stopped due to her decreasing platelet count. However, she was found to have a positive HIT antibody and was admitted for initiation of Argatroban therapy on [**3387-3-5**]. Followup testing with serotonin releasing assay was negative, thereby making HIT diagnosis unlikely. It was decided to stop Argatroban. She had a repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy done on [**3387-3-1**] and [**3387-3-9**], both showing no evidence for patient's known leukemia, although the specimen on [**3387-3-9**] showed megakaryocytic hypoplasia. Repeat testing for FLT3 mutation and NPM mutation were sent on [**3387-3-10**] and were negative. Ms. [**Known patient lastname 20010**] was further evaluated with a repeat ultrasound which continued to shows a superficial clot in the saphenous vein, but there was no evidence for deep vein thrombosis, so she did not require any further anticoagultion, which would have been difficult as her platelet count has remained low. She also was reevaluated with echocardiogram which showed improvement in her left ventricular ejection fraction to 50-55%. Ms. [**Known patient lastname 20010**] was initially discharged to home on [**3387-3-14**], but fell. She was readmitted overnight. CT of the head was negative, and she was discharged to [**Location (un) 1022**] for further rehabilitation. She has been followed in the outpatient setting for transfusion support.

45 y/o female with known CAD s/p CABG [**2757**] presenting to [**Hospital1 18**] upon transfer from [**Hospital1 34**] for shortness of breath.  She was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 34**] (discharged on [**8-2**]) with CHF and eventually transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management. She was medically managed and discharged home. This most recent episode began two nights ago.  She had some shortness of breath that resolved after she took her home dose of lasix (20mg).  Denied any symptoms over the day yesterday but then  woke up over night and felt quite short of breath. She took 20mg PO lasix but said she "could not urinate".  Symptoms progressively worsened so she called 911 and was taken to [**Hospital1 34**]. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 34**], O2 sat was 80% with rapid respirations.  The patient was started on CPAP and sats increased to 100%. The patient was also given 20mg IV lasix at [**Hospital1 34**].  Remained pain free.  Then transferred for cardiac catheterization.

Ms [**Known patient lastname 19161**] is a 45 year old female who inverted her left ankle on [**2766-8-30**] resulting in a left bimalleolar ankle fracture requiring surgical fixation. 
Ms [**Known patient lastname 19161**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**9-15**], and recent hospitalization for septic arthritis who was to be directly admitted for acute renal failure today, but was also found to be in respiratory distress with an echo significant for new severe MR and pulmonary hypertension. Of note the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 20161**] for septic arthritis, for which she went to the OR for washout and was started on 6 weeks of Vancomycin/Ceftazidime. During this admission, her creatinine was increased to 1.6 on admission, and decreased to her baseline of 1.2 without intervention. Her home dose of Rapamune was stopped in order to assist in healing after the procedure, her home Lasix dose was increased to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **], and her Lisinopril was held on discharge. On [**2-10**] her tacrolimus level was undetectable, despite being on 3 mg [**Hospital1 **] (on [**2-7**] it had been 2.7). Her creatinine was noted to increase from 1.2 on [**2-10**] to 1.9 on [**2-13**]. She was supposed to be a direct admission today, however when EMS picked her up to bring her to the hospital, she was noted to have respiratory distress so she was brought to the ED instead of the floor. Her respiratory distress began two days ago. She states her dyspnea began suddenly and slowly increased over the two days. Per her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], she had had recurrent admissions to [**Hospital 7817**] for CHF exacerbations thought to be due to acutely worsening mitral regurgitation in the setting of ischemia. She states that her symptoms are similar to the symptoms she had with previous admissions for heart failure. She also does note that she had had decreased urine output for the past few days. In the ED, initial vitals were T 96 HR 80 BP 113/63 RR 20 Sat 97% on 15L high flow. She was given cefepime and vancomycin due to concern for pneumonia. There was concern for PE, however she could not undergo a CTA due to her ARF. LENIs were done, but not yet read. A TTE was also done to look for evidence of right heart strain and unexpectedly showed new severe mitral regurgiation and new pulmonary hypertension. She had crackles on exam and a BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 20162**] so she was given 40 mg IV lasix for volume overload. She was placed on BiPAP 8/5 for respiratory support with some improvement. Her creatinine in the ED was 2.2. She was given 100 mg of hydrocortisone for rejection. Plan per renal for her acute rejection is hydrocortisone 100 mg q8h. She was also given zofran for nausea. Currently she feels tired and complains of dyspnea. She denies chest pain, but does admit to pain in her left ankle of [**7-25**]. On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other review of systems were negative. Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. She does admit to stable 3 pillow orthopnea. 
A 45 year-old woman with past medical history of diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, coronary disease s/p CABG in [**3-16**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA, OMI-Diag) with known occlusion of 2 SVGs with patent SVG to RCA and LIMA to LAD, diastolic CHF (EF 50-55%), ESRD s/p kidney transplant, who presents today with acute onset shortness of breath. Patient says the symptoms started on the morning of admission with acute onset SOB that woke her from sleep. There was associated chest tightness. Both symptoms improved markedly once she sat up, but she continued to experience mild shortness of breath so she called 911. She was initially evaluated at [**Hospital6 33**] where she was placed on a nitro drip (CP resolved) and BiPAP. She was given 80 mg IV Lasix with unclear amount of urine output. Cardiac enzymes were negative. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further care. Her vitals at time of transfer were T 98, BP 125/26, RR 32, sat 100% on BiPAP. In the ED she was noted to have bibasilar crackles on exam. An EKG showed no ischemic changes and CXR showed no clear infiltrate (by my read). She was weaned off of BiPAP and placed on 2L oxygen by nasal cannula. She was given one dose of levofloxacin 750 mg IV and Dilaudid 1 mg IV and admitted to the CCU given her tenuous respiratory status. Urine output per [**Hospital1 **] records was 200 cc since arrival in the ED. Her vitals at time of transfer were BP 151/60, HR 87, satting 96% 2L, RR 16. Of note, the patient was recently admitted and discharged two weeks prior to this for worsening dyspnea. She was found on TTE to have new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. A Swan-Ganz was placed that showed [**Hospital1 **] pulmonary pressures, decreased SVR, and [**Hospital1 **] CO and CI. She was tried on various meds to control her blood pressure and reduce her afterload, including a nitroglycerine drip, a nitroprusside drip, and IV hydralazine. With the afterload reduction achieved by these medications, her dyspnea improved. She was also diuresed with IV Lasix. Of note, while the patient was in the CCU, she was evaluated by CT surgery for potential mitral valve surgery in the future with plan for follow-up as outpatient. Of note, Lasix dose was recently decreased to 80 mg tablets twice daily, every other day; this was decreased from one tablet twice daily every day. This change was made one week ago by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. In the interim since the last admission, patient reports that she has been doing okay. This morning was her first episode of shortness of breath. 
76-year-old woman who previously had been admitted for management of atrial fibrillation and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.  The latter was thought to be due to QT prolongation from disopyramide, leading to torsade de pointes.  She had no further episodes of VT.  Regarding her atrial fibrillation, this was managed with both amiodarone and diltiazem to control her rate.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor after discharge on [**3066-3-6**], showed atrial fibrillation at rates of 60-110.  During the hospitalization also, she was discovered to have severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. 
65 F c CAD/CHF, diabetes, hypertension, [**First Name3 (LF) 20169**] [**First Name3 (LF) 20170**], schizoaffective disorder, smoking history who was recently hospitalized for shortness of breath thought [**1-26**] to CHF ([**Date range (1) 20172**]). Diuresed with successful resolution of symptoms . On the day prior to admission, daughter called PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: psychiatric concerns (non-sensical conversations, confusion re: meds). Saw psych this morning; felt that pt. thought process linear and cognition intact. Saw PCP on the afternoon of admission and complained of SOB. O2 sat was 89% RA and improved with supplemental O2 by NC. She also complained of chest pressure at that time and received SLNTG with good effect, she was then sent to ED. . In ED the pt was afebrile c BP 175/74. Negative set of cardiac enzymes. Etiology of dyspnea remained unclear and she was treated for CHF c 20 IV lasix, COPD flare c solumedrol, levofloxacin, nebulizers, and treated for possible CAD contributing to symptoms. She Recevied ASA, lopressor, and had one episode of CP in ED requiring SLNTG. 
66 F c CAD/CHF, diabetes, hypertension, [**First Name3 (LF) 20169**] [**First Name3 (LF) 20170**], schizoaffective disorder, who presents with shortness of breath. The pt recalls that she started to have trouble breathing this morning. it came on gradually and worsened slowly. It was initally associated with non-radiating chest pain over her left chest and sternum, which was pressure like, pleuritic and positional as well as intermittent and resolved completed already when "the paramedics started working on me". On further questioning the patient reports shortness of breath already overnight as well as 3-pillow orthopnea. She also recalls a more pronounced LLE over the last three days. She denies any dietary indiscretion, however reports sometimes eating salt, "but not too much". She reports taking her medications diligently. .

67 yo female with CHF/COPD d/c'd on [**7-1**] after hospitalization for CHF and UTI who presented to ED on [**2921-8-5**] with flash pulmonary edema likely secondary to hypertensive emergency requiring intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have a persistent UTI. The patient denied CP, f/c, n/v. No home 02 requirement. . At presentation in the [**Name (NI) **], pt was persistently hypoxic to the 70s despite increasing oxygenation. She was placed on nitro gtt for inital BPs >200 [**1-25**] medication noncompliance. Max BP in ED 257/108. She was also given CTX/levaquin for question of PNA on CXR along with + UA, IV steroids, nebs, and lasix. Her BNP was elevated at ~7000. After stabilization, the patient was transferred to the MICU. . MICU COURSE. Captopril and hydralazine were added to her home BP regimen, and nitro drip was weaned off on [**8-7**]. She was diuresed 2L over length of stay with IV lasix. She was extubated on [**2921-8-7**]. She was found to have an E.coli UTI. She was continued on ceftriaxone. There was concern regarding her mental status while intubated. A head CT was performed and was unremarkable. . At time of MICU call-out, she denied SOB, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. No orthopnea or PND. She reported feeling as though her respiratory status was at baseline. 
The patient is an 88-year-old female nursing home resident with mild mental retardation who presented to [**Hospital3 1181**] with a temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit per rectum, hypertension, and rigors in the setting of one week of upper respiratory symptoms (which included a cough) and malodorous urine in the Foley catheter. The patient was found to be hypotensive to 70/48 which was unresponsive to fluid boluses.  The patient was given moxifloxacin and started on a dopamine drip.  The patient was also given vitamin K for an INR of 7.2 at [**Hospital3 20174**]. She was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 186**] Emergency Department.  The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for presumed sepsis from a urinary tract infection versus pneumonia. A chest x-ray on admission showed a left lower lobe infiltrate versus atelectasis.  An additional of normal saline was given at [**Hospital1 69**], and a central line was placed.  The patient was started on Levaquin to treat pneumonia and urinary tract infection. 
See MICU [**Location (un) **] note from [**7-25**] for full details. Briefly this is a 79yo patient with PMH significant for HTN, CAD, s/p CABG being transferred from the ICU for probable angioedema after taking lisinopril. . Patient had been giving script for lisinopril a while back but only started taking it on Friday [**7-23**] AM. He started to feel his lips, tongue and face swelling and it progressivly worsened to include his throat. He was admitted to the ICU and was intubated and sedated. ENT saw patient and recommended keeping tube in place. However, patient self-extubated overnight and actually remained stable. His condition improved and he was transferred to the floor for further care. . On arrival to the medical floor, patient was stable. Vital signs- T 96.5, HR 74, BP 125/64, R 14, satting 100% on 4L. No complaints except for some facial swelling but reduced from admission. Denied any shortness of breath, chest pain, headaches, dizziness. Doing well, comfortable. 
58 yo with DM, CAD, HTN s/p mechanical fall admitted [**3152-1-10**] to ortho for distal right femoral fracture, went for ORIF today with unremarkable intraop course until ~1hr into the procedure when she suddendly developed acute onset of hypotension and hypoxia, intraop TEE revealed dilated RV/RA and impaired wall motion and large ASD, concerning for acute embolic events.  Pulm angiogram by IR showed no clear PE but ?decreased flow to right pulm artery. IR did inject 50mg TPA into pulm artery and started her on NO for pulm hypertension. Venogram showed DVT but IR did put in a temp IVC filter. Initial PA mean presssure was around 28 but later improved to around 17.  EKG with more right-ish axis but otherwise no evidence of acute ST/T changes. 
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 75 year old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and diastolic congestive heart failure who presented to [**Location (un) 738**] [**Hospital 20196**] Hospital on [**3294-4-29**] with worsening shortness of breath.  According the her family the patient had increasing lower extremity edema for one week and one day of heavy breathing at rest.  Her dyspnea was not relieved by her albuterol inhaler.  On the afternoon of admission she experienced dull substernal chest pain without radiation, initially [**2-22**] but increasing to [**7-25**], that lasted for 4-6 hours, for which she called EMS. . She presented to the [**Location (un) 738**]-[**Location (un) 3627**] ED, where her initial vitals signs were notable for a blood pressure of 220/80 in the setting of respiratory distress.  She was treated with Combivent nebulziers, Solumedrol 125 mg IV x1, Lasix 40 mg IV, aspirin, nitropaste and sublingual nitroglyerin with improvement in her symptoms.  She was initially on a nitro gtt. Her EKG showed NSR at 62 with no obvious evidence of ischemia. Her troponins came back elevated and she was started on a heparin and nitro drips and transferred to the ICU. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization. . On review of systems she currently denies fevers, chills, lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, diarrhea, constipation.  She has chronic leg swelling which is much improved from her hospitalization here in [**Month (only) **].  She has two pillow orthopnea which has not worsened.  She denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  All other review of systems negative in detail. 
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a PMH significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, ischemic cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease (status-post BMS to RCA in [**2961**]) who presented to [**Hospital3 **] after a sudden onset of chest "discomfort" with associated diaphoresis. EMS was called after the patient had chest pain and was found to be ashen. EKG showed STE in III>II and aVF. He was initially taken to [**Hospital3 **] where he recieved ASA 325mg, and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. In the ED here at [**Hospital1 18**]  he was given a Plavix load of 600mg and taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab. Cardiac catheterization revealed total occlusion of the RCA at the site of his prior stent, into which a new BMS was placed. There was also evidence of diffuse left main and LAD disease. Right sided filling pressures were also noted to be elevated. During the procedure the patient had an episode of VF and his implanted ICD fired and converted him to back sinus rhythm. . Of note the patient had also been experiencing melena for the past few weeks. His PCP had taken him off of daily ASA for this in mid-[**2972-9-21**]. He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**10-28**] for a recent admission after having melena with some concurrent "demand ischemia" as his troponins were noted to be elevated. .

This is a 61-year-old Russian woman with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hyperthyroid, elevated LFTs, gastritis, anemia, who had three prior admissions for shortness of breath and chest pain.  Most recently ruled out for an MI three weeks ago with a previous admit of [**4-14**] for left sided pleural effusion and shortness of breath.  Effusion was tapped and was found to be transudative in nature with mild elevations in her pulmonary arterial pressures and question right heart failure at that time.  She was discharged on Lasix but was not taking any currently on [**7-14**].  She presents again with shortness of breath.  The week prior to this admission the patient noticed increasing dyspnea on exertion and increasing lower extremity edema with transient chest pain plus minus pleuritic in nature.  She went to her PCP's office and had an echocardiogram there which showed increased pulmonary arterial pressures to 79, 3+ TR and normal left ventricular function with a sinus bradycardia at 52.  She was sent to the Emergency Room for concern of PE.  She had an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air in the Emergency Room.  CT angio was negative for PE.  Chest x-ray and CT showed a right base patchy infiltrate and effusion with interval increase in size in her bulky mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy on the CT scan.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 56 year-old man with DM1, ESRD, PVD, dCHF, and recurrent admissions for hypoglycemia presents with hypoglycemia requiring intubation for unresponsiveness and is transferred to the MICU for further management. . He was recently discharged on [**3310-2-15**] after presenting with lethargy and hypoglycemia. His course was complicated by left sided subdural hematoma found in the setting of AMS evaluation, and AV fistula clot requiring thrombectomy. He was due for dialysis today but missed his session and per report was found at home unresponsive. He was brought be EMS to the ED. . In the ED, vital signs were initially: 29C rectal 45 150/palp 20 95%nrb. He had an undetectable glucose level and was intubated for agonal breathing with etomidate 20 mg iv and roc 10 mg iv and was also given 1 amp calcium gluconate, 1 amp d50, vanc/zosyn empirically, levothyroxine 37.5 mcg iv x 1, solumedrol 125 mg iv x 1, and started on glucose drip. A right femoral groin line ws placed semi-sterily. A bear hugger was placed and temp rose to 29.7 after 1.5 hours. His ETT was pulled back after a CXR demonstrated partial right main stem intubation and he was transferred to the MICU for further evaluation. . In the MICU, the patient was extubated and his blood sugars were controlled [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recommendations. Pt was warmed to good effect. Vanc and zosyn was discontinued on [**3310-2-19**]. He was found to have gram positive rods grow on [**3310-2-20**] 0500 in 1 anaerobic bottle dated from [**3310-2-18**].  Speciation is pending.

She was initially given reular insulin 10 units x 2 with decrease in her glucose to 439 and persistant anion gap so she was started on insulin gtt at 5 units/hour.  She also had an EKG which showed increased ST depressions and T wave inversions in V3-V6 and new T wave inversions in III and aVF.  She was given NTG x1 and morphine 2mg IV with resolution of her chest pain.  First set of cardiac enzymes with CK of 93 and troponin of 0.04.  She was also given zofran 4mg IV x2, compazine 10mg IV x1 and reglan 10mg IV x1 for nausea.  She was given 3L NS prior to transfer. 
This is an 84-year-old female with CAD, hypertension, CHF, atrial fibrillation, mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, status post AVR here from [**Hospital 99**] Rehab complaining of nausea and vomiting and found to have new acute renal failure and transaminitis. Patient was thought to be more confused and weaker with decreased appetite, nausea with retching.  She was found to have a potassium of 6.0 in the ED and treated with Kayexalate.  Recently her amiodarone dose had been increased. 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 54-year female with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, renal transplant and significant peripheral [**Known patient lastname 1092**] disease who presented with a several day history of abdominal discomfort and worsened over the past 24 hours. She was seen in the emergency room and was found to be in relative extremis condition. Although hemodynamically stable, she had extensive peritonitis. She underwent a CTA of the abdomen which demonstrated what appeared to be a thrombosis of the SMA and thickening of the left and right colon. She was taken to the operating room urgently for exploration. 
56 year-old man with DM1 with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome, ESRD, PVD, chronic diastolic CHF, poor historian with numerous admissions for hypoglycemia who presents from HD with hyperglycemia.  Pt presented for HD today which was unable to be performed due to a clotted AVG.  He was found to have a FSBS >450.  He also reported nausea and small amounts of vomiting beginning this afternoon. Per his sister, he had been more lethargic starting on Saturday.  He denies any fevers, chills, cough, chest pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. . In the ED, initial VS were: T 98, P 106, BP 185/111, RR 24, O2sat 100. Labs showed WBC 12.7 (no bands but neut predominant), K 5.4, bicarb 24, gluc 580, anion gap 23.  EKG was without peaked t waves but was notable for new TWI in V4-V6.  Added on CE with nl CK & CK-MB but trop 0.33 in setting of Cr 6.8.  CXR showed a RLL opacity.  PIV 20g x 2 placed.   Pt was given insulin 10 units, then started on a gtt at 7 units/hour.  He was also given IVF at 150 cc/h (conservative as not dialyzed today and limited UOP ~ once weekly) and started on vanc/zosyn for PNA.  Lactate initially 2.8 -> 1.8.  He was evaluated by Surgery re: HD access.  Renal was made aware with plan for HD tmrw pending access. On transfer, vitals: 98. 108, 28, 143/97, 100% 1L. ABG: 7.43/24/144/16 with lytes on that Na 144, K 1.9*, Cl 121, Glc 259, question if drawn near running IVF. . On the floor, pt is lethargic. He is responsive to voice and does sit up to pull on more blankets and complains of feeling cold but variably answering questions although responses appropriate when he does. Does admit to noncompliance with his insulin.  No vomiting since earlier this afternoon. 
56 yo M with a past medical history of ESRD on HD, DM1, CHF presents from HD with nausea and vomitting. History is unclear because patient is unresponsive, but history is gathered from family members and [**Name (NI) **] documentation. Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] has a history of noncompliance, and evidently skipped HD on Saturday. He was found to be weak this morning, and his brother brought him to HD. At HD, patient was noted to have periorbital edema. He received 45 minutes of HD and developed nausea and vomitting x1. Vomitus was grossly nonbloody and guaiac positive, so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. . According to the family, patient was supposed go to HD on saturday (last HD was the previous Thurday), but did not tell family why he was not going. They noticed that his face and eyes were swollen, and sugar was noted to be elevated. He had reduced po intake over the last 4 days. He was not complainig of particular symptoms including fevers, chest pain, palpitations or lightheadedness. . At [**Hospital1 18**], patient was A and O x3 but belligerent and refusing labs and venous access. His HCP was called, and because there was a question of competence in the past, sister gave approval to sedate and restrain as needed for appropriate workup. He was given Haldol 5 mg IM and Ativan 2 mg IM and placed in 4 point restraints. An 18 G IV was obtained. Serum glucose was found to be 815 with a gap of 17, so IV insulin 10 U was given. He did not receive fluids because of concern that the patient is anuric. Patient refused a rectal, but there was a report of loose stool last week before the patient was chemically sedated. CXR was reportedly normal. Blood culture were sent. On transfer, patient was unresponsive but maintaing his airway, with VS 95, 95/62, 14, 96% RA . In the ICU, patient is unresponsive but appears comfortable. . Review of sytems: Not assessed due to mental status. 
57 yo M with a past history of DMI, ESRD on HD, CHF, PVD who presents to the ED with hyperglycemia noted at dialysis. Patient arrived for scheduled HD today feeling in his USOH and was found to have a "critically high" finger stick glucose, so patient was transferred to the ED. Patient denies frank symptoms including fever, chills, abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting and cough. Patient does report medicine noncompliance, and tells me that he did not take his insulin today or yesterday because he "did not feel like it", and "because I know when I'm in DKA". Patient has a history of noncompliance, and takes several of his other medications on a periodic basis, including his statin and steroid. Other than not taking his 2 dogs for a walk yesterday, but he states this was not because he was lethargic or confused. . In the ED, patient was noted to have a serum glucose of 639 with an AG of 20, and a VBG with a pH of 7.36. He received an IV bolus of Regular 8U, and was started on an insulin drip  of 8 U/hr. No imaging was performed and a UA was not obtained. He received 1L of saline. [**Name (NI) **] father, who is legal guardian, was [**Name (NI) 647**] in the [**Name (NI) **]. On transfer, VS were 96.9, 79, 112/42, 99% RA. . In the ICU, patient reports feeling well. He is asking to go home, but is happy to stay in the hospital as long as his doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 20752**]. . Of note, patient was admitted [**11-29**] - [**11-30**] with acute hyperglycemia in the setting of prednisone tapering. Finger sticks during admission were in 200s-300s. He was discharged with prednisone 5 mg [**Hospital1 **] and his insulin regimen was unchanged. Of note he missed his follow up appointments with [**Last Name (un) **] and and his PCP. .

The patient is a 58 yo M with DM 1 and ESRD on HD (last HD yesterday) who presented with nausea and vomiting since this morning. At that point, his blood sugar was >400, which improved to 250 after 4 units humalog. In the ED, the vitals were 97 87 137/88 24 100%. He refused exam including rectal exam, multiple lab draws and an ECG. His legal [**First Name3 (LF) 18064**] was not called. He was noted to have coffee grounds emesis and GI was called. He refused NG tube. He eventually allowed labs which were notable for a hematocrit of 35, a respiratory alkalosis and a metabolic acidosis. He eventually allowed an ECG which showed T wave inversions in the anterior leads. He was not given any aspirin given concern for GI bleed. His only access was a 22 gauge and he refused attempts at additional access. His father reports that he was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 2148**]. He was admitted threre for hypoglycemia. He was discharged to HD on saturday and was feeling unwell afterwards. At that time his blood sugar was 17. He did not complain of nausea/vomiting until the morning of admission. His father did not observe the emesis but was not told that there was blood or coffee grounds. He is not aware of whether the patient had hematochezia or melena. 
The patient is a 52-year-old man with diabetes type 1, for 40 years, complicated by retinopathy with blindness, status post living donor kidney transplant in [**2810**], status post bilateral BKAs with recent stump revision on [**2822-5-4**], with prior known .............. from catheterization in [**2815**], who presented with chest pain on [**2822-5-13**], from [**Hospital6 3894**] admitted for unstable angina, as well as right stump cellulitis. The patient was treated with Ancef and Cipro per Infectious Disease recommendations for the cellulitis.  He was kept on intravenous Heparin, Aspirin, Nitroglycerin drip, beta-blocker over the weekend for unstable angina without further chest pain or shortness of breath, awaiting prior catheterization data which had reportedly shown unintervenable ........... per the patient.  His primary cardiologist is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Laboratory showed a troponin on admission of 0.8 which increased to 16.8 with negative CKs but positive MB fraction. On the morning of [**2822-5-16**], the patient had sudden shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea and vomiting.  He was found to be hypoxic with an oxygen saturation in the 60s, on 100% non-rebreather, systolic blood pressure 150-160, heart rate 80-90s.  His electrocardiogram showed hyperacute T-wave anteriorly, ST depressions in V2-V4, and chest x-ray was consistent with failure.  The patient was given Lasix 40 IV x 1, with 500 cc urine output.  He was given 1 amp of Calcium Gluconate and was started on intravenous Nitroglycerin with improvement in his electrocardiogram changes. ABG was done which showed pH of 7.18, pCO2 73, pO2 46.  The patient was intubated on the floor emergently.  The decision was made to take him to Cardiac Catheterization for acute coronary event.  Bedside echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of less than 20-25%, inferior akinesis, and anterolateral hypokinesis.  In the Catheterization Lab, his coronaries were diffusely diseased.  The patient had been previously turned down for a coronary artery bypass grafting, but CT Surgery was reconsulted and again did not feel that he would be a good operative candidate.  .................. requested a second CT Surgery opinion which was prior to recathaterization to attempt LAD intervention.  This was obtained, and again several CT surgeons did not feel that he would be a good operative candidate secondary to high risk, lack of good touchdown, and lack of vein grafts secondary to his previous surgeries. Otherwise in the CCU, the patient was diuresed and extubated on [**2822-5-17**], without complication.  His creatinine was slightly increased with this event.  His Captopril was temporarily discontinued, and diuresis was continued.  He was on continued antibiotics for stump cellulitis. LABORATORY DATA:  His initial lab data at the time of transfer back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 194**] Service on [**2822-5-19**], showed a white count which was 19.1, hematocrit 30.0, platelet count 466,000; INR 1.1, PTT 58.0; sodium 128, potassium 4.3, chloride 93, bicarb 23, BUN 78, creatinine 1.8, glucose 255, CK 45, calcium 8.5, magnesium 2.2, phosphorus 4.2; cyclosporin level was normal at 151. Cardiac catheterization showed RA pressure of 9, RV was 40/10, RA 40/21, wedge pressure 21, SER 1390, cardiac index of 3.0.  He had 100% proximal RCA lesion, normal PDA, left main was normal, mid LAD had a tubular 90% lesion, distal LAD 40% lesion, D1 70%, D2 99%, OM1 70%.  Echocardiogram showed a ................. ASD with left-to-right shunt seen, left ventricular size and thickness normal.  There were multiple areas of akinesis and hypokinesis.  There was a hypertrophied right ventricular free wall with normal right ventricular function.  There was a small amount of mitral regurgitation, small to moderate pericardial effusion, and a right pleural effusion noted.

The patient is a 53 year old man with a history of coronary artery disease, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for 40 years and a renal transplant in [**2810**] who presented who presented with an increased dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath at rest, increased over a chronic baseline level.  The patient noted symptoms acutely worsened one day prior to admission prompting an Emergency Room visit.  In the Emergency Room the patient denied chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis as well as fever and chills.  The patient did note that his usual dose of Lasix was not working.  In the Emergency Room he was found to be sating high 90s on 2 liters after 80 mg of Lasix. He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 194**] floor he was found to have a low saturation.  He was put on 100% nonrebreather, sating in the mid 90s.  Respiratory rate was 30s to 40s.  The patient was given 40 plus 40 of intravenous Lasix without any increased urine output.  On the nitroglycerin drip and Morphine the patient was able to diurese 200 cc.  The patient's respiratory rate decreased to the 20s.  The patient's examination had improved.  the patient was taken to the Catheterization laboratory where he was found to be 80% on 100% nonrebreather.  The patient was also found to have lateral electrocardiogram changes.  He was diaphoretic and not complaining of chest pain but noting paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea. 
58 year old with PMH of ischemic CM (EF 20%), CAD, severe 3VD (not a CABG candidate), type 1 DM presents with nausea and hypotension.  Recently seen in advanced heart failure clinic on [**9-10**], BP noted to be over 200, and his hyral was increased from 25 qid to 50 tid. Lasix increased from 60 qam to 60 am/40 qpm. Also got MRI of his kidneys which showed severe renal artery narrowing.  Pt reports that since the next day after the MRI, he has increasing nasuea; no f / c / n s / c p/sob/pnd/orthopnea/vomiting/diarrhea/hematochezia/melena/recent NSAID use/decreased UOP.

58 year old with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20%), severe 3 vessel coronary artery disease, type 1 diabetes, chronic renal disease status post renal transplant in [**2810**] who presents with lethargy and fever to 102.6.  He had had decreased ability to care for himself over the last few days with a progressive nonproductive cough.  He notes a dry nonproductive cough.  He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or hematochezia. 
67-year-old man with a history of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed in 12/97.  The patient is status post multiple courses of chemotherapy, including chlorambucil, prednisone, CVP, fludarabine, Rituxan, adriamycin, and Decadron.  Most recently, the patient has been on Taxol, 714X and GSCF.  The patient had discontinued Taxol and was only on 714X, which is an experimental Canadian drug.  However, on [**3084-8-21**], he was admitted to [**Hospital1 186**] with fever and neutropenia.  He was treated with ceftazidime, but had no signs of infection.  His ceftazidime was discontinued, and he had no evidence of infection despite a thorough Infectious Disease workup, including an Infectious Disease consult, six blood cultures which were negative, multiple negative urine and stool cultures.  His fevers were attributable to his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and he was discharged home on [**3084-8-29**]. The patient was doing fine at home until Monday, when he had increased weakness, increased urinary frequency, and fever from 100 to 100.5.  He denies cough, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, headache, or abdominal pain.  He does report a new rash on both his arms, and diarrhea.  The patient received Taxol chemotherapy that Thursday, [**3084-8-28**], prior to discharge.  In the Emergency Room this time, the patient received ceftazidime 2 grams x 1, Tylenol, Motrin and intravenous fluids.  His vital signs at this time were a temperature of 103.4, blood pressure 110/60 in the Emergency Room. 
55 F with complicated medical history who has been transferred from Rehab/[**Hospital3 412**] for dyspnea, acute on chronic renal failure, volume overload, and fungemia. In [**Month (only) 115**] of this year, presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with abdominal pain. Has significant PMHx for T1DM, HTN, PVD and was found in the ED to have extensive calcification of her mesenteric arteries. She was taken to the OR and found to have infarction of her colon with intact small bowel. She under went a colectomy with iliostomy at that time. Post op had respiratory failure requiring prolonged intubation and eventual tracheostomy. The etiology of her respiratory failure was unclear at her discharge. She was discharged to [**Location (un) 4308**] [**Hospital 20796**] rehab on [**3432-5-24**] after ~30 day hospitalization on TPN via CVL with tube feeds started. The plan was to advance tube feeds and wean TPN. On [**3432-6-9**], she was still on TPN at rehab and spiked a temperature up to 103 and blood cultures were positive for yeast ([**Female First Name (un) **] albicans by telephone report but not documented in transfer records). She was transferred to [**Hospital3 412**] in [**Hospital1 1456**] for further management. There she was initially given voriconazole and her central line replaced. Culture from the line again reportedly grew [**Female First Name (un) **]. She was then switched to fluconazole and finally to caspofungin today. She was also treated with ticarcillin/clavulanate for unclear reasons. During her hospitalization, she also had a "troponin leak" without EKG changes thought to be demand ischemia by their cardiology consultants. An echo done on [**3432-6-10**] showed global hypokinesis with EF 25-30%, dilated LA, LVH, moderated MR, moderate TR, although image quality was poor. Her hospitalization was also complicated by hyponatremia of unclear [**Name2 (NI) 10674**]. Her hospitalization was also complicated by acute on chronic renal failure (s/p transplant in [**3417**]). She did have episode of ATN in setting of her mesenteric ischemia with peak Cr of 4.3 with return to her baseline of 1.4-1.8 at time of discharge. Upon admission to [**Hospital3 412**] her Cr was 3.7 and remained elevated. It is unclear what work up was done for this. On the day of admission, she also developed respiratory distress with increasing volume retention. Attempts at diuresis with Lasix 400 mg IV were unsuccesful. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of her fungemia, renal failure and repiratory distress. Immediately prior to discharge or in the ambulance she was started on a nitro dip for again unclear reasons. 
70y/o F with DM2, HTN, ESRD on HD, dCHF, Dementia, was noted to have mental status changes (verbally unresponsive) after HD today. Nurse at the HD center states that she usually is AxOx4 but today was noted to have altered level of consciousness. BG was noted to be 70. Given food, BG increased to 100. Patient received 4 hours of HD, patient altered throughout. After HD, called 911 for unresponsiveness. Pt responds to pain but does not follow commands.  She had 3 hours and 15min of dialysis, her pre HD weight was 54kg, post was 50.7kg. In field patients vital signs were: HR: 98, BP: 116/40, RR: 14, sats 100%, gluc 105. In ED noted to have fever to 101.0, HR: 101, BP: 80/42, RR: 14, Sats 99%. Code sepsis called, patient was had central access placed in right femoral vein, given 1l NS, CTX 1gm and vancomycin 1gm. She was also given 1gm tylenol, haldol 2.5mg x1. 
The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease (with a history of an inferior wall myocardial infarction in [**3411**]; status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**3411**] and a redo coronary artery bypass graft in [**3429**]) who was admitted on [**3442-8-15**] for three days of persistent epigastric discomfort. At this point, the patient denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, headaches, visual changes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fevers, chills, or sweats.  The patient complained of increased bloating and belching which was not similar to anginal pain he had experienced in the past.  He denied having chest pain for the past 12 years. On [**3442-8-17**], the patient was awoken from sleep when he had [**11-11**] anginal chest pain.  Electrocardiogram was without evidence of ST segment elevations.  Initial cardiac enzymes were negative on admission; however, now are significant for a troponin T elevation from 0.54 to 0.85.  However, his creatine phosphokinase of 129 was trending down. An echocardiogram was performed, and the patient was found to have an ejection fraction of 25%, paced at 58 (which was elevated) and a new 4+ mitral regurgitation.  The patient was then referred for a cardiac catheterization. In the Catheterization Laboratory, angiography revealed a 90% stenosis of the proximal saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and 80% stenosis of the distal ramus.  A stent was placed in the proximal region of the saphenous vein graft with no evidence of residual stenosis and resultant TIMI-III flow.  The patient was started on Integrilin and milrinone and transferred to the Coronary Care Unit. 
85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary HTN, atrial fib, rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR, HTN, who presents from [**Hospital1 **] with lethargy and AMS. Recent history is remarkable for being discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2909-5-6**] after presenting with abdominal pain, being found to have SBO and undergoing lysis of adhesions and left inguinal hernia repair, with a course complicated by pneumonia for which she received vanc/zosyn and eventually required trach/PEG for difficulty weaning off ventilator (was unsuccessfully extubated during hospital stay). . She was doing well at [**Hospital1 **] until the morning of admission when she was noted to be more lethargic and to have AMS. At baseline, she is alert and oriented x 3 but was less responsive. She was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. . In the ED, initial vs were: 98F->100.4 103 95/60->75/55 100% on trach mask. She had a RUQ U/S which was negative and a CXR which showed a RLL pneumonia, and she was given levo/flagly for possible c. diff, and vancomycin/ceftriaxone for healthcare-associated pna. Her mental status was waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 681**] but she was not felt to need an LP. Her SBP rose to 95 after infusion of 3L NS. Given her transient hypotension and concern for sepsis, she was admitted to the MICU for further management. . On the floor, she was able to answer simple questions. Her passy-muir valve had been removed but per report, even while it was in place in the ED, she was nonverbal. She denied chest pain, headache, shortness of breath, and pain in general. . Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath.

85 year-old female with seizures, CHF (right sided), pulmonary HTN, atrial fib, rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR, HTN, presents with fever, hypotension, seizures. She has been at [**Hospital **] rehab recovering from a SBO surgery in the spring and has been slowly worsening. She had a seizure 2 weeks ago and was started on Keppra. Two days ago, her keppra dose was decreased for a high peak and somnalence. On [**7-31**], she was febrile to 102.8. She has had continued ventilator requirement. . In the ED, initial vs were: T 105.4 P 82 BP 96/60 R O2 sat 100. She was hypotensive to 70s/40s from baseline 90s/60s but responded to 2 L IVF. Exam showed unresponsive cachectic woman with warm basilar ralles and cuts in teeth and mouth c/w seizure. Guiac (+) stool. EKG showed new lateral downsloping st depressions. ED doctor discussed code status with son, who confirmed DNR, moving to CMO but wanted a last hurrah. Family did not want a LP because it was too invasive and did not want a CT scan because they did not want any surgeries to correct what might be found. She was given Acetaminophen 650mg x2, Piperacillin-Tazob, Vancomycin 1g, Acyclovir, Aspirin 600mg Supp. Prior to transfer, vitals were HR 77 BP 81/49, RR 33 ovebreathing vent, sat 97% on RR 10, TV 359 PEEP 5, FiO2 40%. 
This is a 58 year old man who presented with shortness of breath since four days prior to admission.  This is a gentleman with type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular disease and a family history of coronary artery disease who reported increasing shortness of breath since the [**11-1**] with a gain of approximately three pounds and increasing lower extremity edema over that week as well as complaints of orthopnea.  The patient only sleeps on one pillow and during this period increased to requiring two or more pillows.  The patient had been on p.o. Lasix of 80 p.o. twice a day.  The patient's primary care physician instructed him to increase the Lasix to 80 mg p.o. three times a day but still received no benefit from the increased dose. He had increasing shortness of breath and presented to [**Hospital3 11385**] on Friday, the [**11-4**] where he was intubated for respiratory distress and also found to have by report from [**Hospital3 **] a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with troponin of 2.2 and a peak CK of 135 and a peak MB of 4.6.  The patient had been treated with Lasix drip and Solu-Medrol and switched to intravenous Niseratide and Nitroglycerin. The patient also was found to be in acute renal failure with a creatinine of 4.4; his baseline was 2.4 in [**3164-4-19**]. The patient had an arteriovenous fistula placed on the [**5-8**] and hemodialyzed about 3 kilograms of fluid and also was given two units of packed red blood cells because of an initial hematocrit of 24%.  The patient was extubated on the [**5-9**] and then transferred here at the family's request. On the day of admission, he was short of breath only with exertion, had no lower extremity edema, but did note a dry cough.  He had no complaint of chest pain, back pain, nausea or vomiting. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems was only pertinent for chronic low back pain.  He denied fevers, nausea, vomiting.

He has had alternating constipation and diarrhea for the last several weeks. 
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 15230**] is a 62-year-old woman who was transferred from [**Hospital6 3057**] for shortness of breath over the last two days. She is a 62-year-old woman with history of small cell lung cancer, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who was well until one week ago when she began to develop a productive cough streaked with blood. Over the last two days, she noticed worsening shortness of breath with exertion particularly with stairs.  She also complained of pleurisy in her left back particularly when taking in deep breaths.  Because of the worsening breathing, her husband brought her to the Emergency Department of [**Hospital6 3057**]. At the outside hospital, she was noted to be pale, dry, and with cool extremities.  Blood pressure was 75-85 systolic. O2 saturation was 85% and increased to 100% on non-rebreather.  A chest x-ray showed increased pleural effusion.  She was treated with fluids, Albuterol, and Ceftriaxone, and subsequently transferred here. The patient denied fever, chest pain, orthopnea (sleeps on one pillow), and peripheral edema.  There was no abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, or bloody stool.  At baseline she is able to walk a block but becomes short of breath with inclines. 
This 76-year-old male with history of coronary artery disease with a history of inferior wall myocardial infarction in [**3411**] status post CABG in [**3411**] and a redo CABG in [**3429**], who is admitted on [**3442-8-15**] for three days of persistent epigastric discomfort.  Patient at this point denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, headaches, visual changes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fevers, chills, or sweats.  The patient complained of increased bloating and belching not similar to anginal pains that he had experienced in the past.  He denied having any chest pain for the past 12 years. On [**3442-8-17**], patient was awoken from his sleep complaining of [**11-11**] anginal chest pain.  Electrocardiogram was without evidence of ST segment elevations.  Initial cardiac enzymes were negative on admission, however, now were significant for troponin-T elevation from 0.54 to 0.85. However, his CPK of 129 was trending down.  Echocardiogram was performed, and patient was found to have ejection fraction of 25%, PA systolic pressure of 58, which is elevated and a new 4+ mitral regurgitation.  Patient was then referred for a catheterization. In the Catheterization Laboratory, angiography revealed a 90% stenosis of proximal saphenous vein graft to his right coronary artery, and 80% stenosis of his distal LIMA.  Stent was placed on the proximal region of his saphenous vein graft with no evidence of residual stenosis and result in TIMI III flow.  The patient was started on Integrilin and milrinone and transferred to the CCU. 
The patient is a 65-year-old gentleman with known coronary artery disease, insulin- dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, and aortic stenosis who presented with worsening dyspnea on exertion for one day prior to arrival.  At baseline, the patient reports dyspnea on exertion with approximately one flight of stairs, but over the past 24 hours, reported minimal movement reproducing the same level of dyspnea, now associated with chest tightness.  The patient denied any diaphoresis or nausea associated with these episodes.  The patient did report increasing orthopnea, but denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or change in his chronic bilateral lower extremity edema.  Initially, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of an outside hospital and by report electrocardiograms revealed evidence of T-wave inversion and ST-segment depression in the lateral leads. The patient was administered low molecular weight heparin and was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization.  Upon obtaining this history from the patient, there was no report of chest pain, and the patient was without dyspnea. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, there was absence of fevers or productive cough.  There had been no recent changes in medications or dietary indiscretion. 
The patient is a 68M with h/o CAD s/p CABG '[**28**], AS , ischemic CM with EF 45% and h/o GI due to AVMs in the past who now p/w 4 days of maroon colored stool, stomach upset and also with increased weight. The patient reports being in his usual state of health until 3 days ago when he noticed that his stool had been becoming darker and had some bright red blood. He has been noticing some exertional CP (stabbing pain in chest) and dyspnea when walking around the house and from the house to the car. He also had an episode 2 days ago of stabbing chest pain when lying down to go to sleep. His symptoms were relieved with a SL nitroglycerin. Also noticed dizziness and lightheadedness over the past 24 hours. . ROS: weight prior to [**Holiday **] was 184. over past month has been creeping up up to between 195-200 over last few days. pt reports he "gets in trouble with SOB when over 190". + throbbing pain in left hand over last few days. . In the ED an NGL was negative, he was given a PPI. Two 18g peripheral IV's were placed. His SBP's remained approximately 100-110's with HR in the 60's. Original EKG was without ischemic changes. While in the ED, the patient began to experience jaw pain and a repeat EKG showed new ST depressions and T wave inversions. He was transfused 2 units of [**Holiday **]. Also the patient had a K=6 and was treated with insulin/amp D50/ bicarb/and calcium gluconate.

This occurred when walking to the car. Felt "clammy", also had N/V once at the hospital. No post fall confusion. No jerking movements, no incontinence. He hit head posteriorly ?anteriorly also. He has lacerations on his forehead but required no stitches. CT head at OSH reportedly normal per patient (report not available at this time). His blood sugar was greater than 400 on arrival. He was give Lantus and regular insulin, Zofran and because his lungs were diminished at the bases and he is chronically short of breath he was given a nebulizer treatment. He also underwent an echocardiogram with the results still pending. He was given Morphine for chest pain with relief. He reports chronic "congestive" chest pain; with questioning this did not seem to be any worse than his baseline today. Also dyspneic with exertion chronically. Also reports heaviness in his calves and legs that limit his exercise tolerance. The few days PTA he attended a day program at [**Last Name (un) **] for improvement in his glucose control.

She presented to ED on [**3249-5-12**] with reports of frequent falls, weakness, headache and dizziness accompanied by nausea, vomiting and diarrhea for one week. A CT of the head showed cortical atrophy, old lacunar infarcts bilaterally in the basal ganglia, small vessel disease, some asymmetry of the periventricular white matter to the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 528**] of the right frontal lobe. She was started on a course of prophylactic antibiotics for recent testing which came back negative for C-diff which she has completed. She was admitted for hydration and developed chest pain shortly after her admission. She was found to be in atrial fibrillation and was admitted to the ICU, was started on amiodarone and converted to SR. She continued to have chest discomfort and subsequently underwent a stress test that revealed an inferior defect with inferior infarct. Troponins were drawn (beginning [**3249-5-15**] 3.07, 3.47, 2.68, 3.53, 4.07) and patient ruled in for NSTEMI. An echo done on [**3249-5-15**] showed an EF of 50-55%. After her chest pain was brought under control and she was subsequently transferred to the telemetry floor and has done well for the past week. She presently denies chest pain. She was transferred for further evaluation and for a cardiac catheterization. She was found to have three vessel disease. She is now being referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization. 
Mr. [**Known patient firstname **] [**Known patient lastname 12424**] is a 49 year old gentleman with a 22 year history of diabetes mellitus. He has a history of peripheral neuropathy, kidney transplantation in [**3191**] secondary to diabetic nephropathy, as well as throat cancer in [**3192**] treated with local resection and radical neck dissection on the left as well as postoperative radiation.  Mr.  [**Known patient lastname 12424**] also had signs and symptoms consistent with cervical myelopathy; a cervical MRI scan showed very impressive disc herniations at C5-C6, less so at C4-C5, with clear cut cord compression, particularly on the right side C5-C6.  Therefore, he was admitted for C4-C5 and C5-C6 anterior diskectomy with autologous bone graft and instrumented fusion. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Postoperative physical examination demonstrated that he was afebrile at 97 degrees; blood pressure 145/80; pulse 60; respiratory rate 10; 100% on a non-rebreather.  He was awake, alert, uncomfortable secondary to incisional tenderness at neck site as well as right iliac graft site.  The wounds were clean, dry and intact, and flat. HOSPITAL COURSE:  While in the PACU, Anesthesia was called because the patient became dyspneic and tachypneic and his SAO2 dropped to 89%.  His respiratory rate was 30 on face mask.  Interoperatively, he was positive two liters with a stable blood pressure and heart rate, although requiring some neo-synephrine interoperatively.  He responded to intravenous Lasix with 3.2 liters of urine output as well as marked clinical improvement. The etiology for his congestive heart failure was determined likely to be diastolic dysfunction from increased heart rate as well as excess volume.  No definite evidence for significant myocardial ischemia, although cardiac enzymes were sent and he ruled out for myocardial infarction. He was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where his respiratory and cardiac status was monitored carefully.  He was given Lasix to continue to diurese the excess volume.  He was also put on Lopressor 150 mg twice a day.  Also in the Intensive Care Unit, O2 saturation was closely monitored. The patient became agitated with both tent and Bi-PAP machine, although continued to saturate well. He was transferred to Medicine the morning of [**3198-7-27**], for continued medical management post surgery.  On the day of transfer, the patient was noted to be confused with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 681**] sensorium; thus, a delirium work-up was initiated looking for precipitants. 1.  When his O2 saturation was monitored, his pulse oximetry remained in the 90s during his stay. 2.  His non-essential medications that may have been contributing to his change in mental status were discontinued; those included Temocillin, Nortriptyline, Haldol, Lorazepam, Venlafaxine, Bupropion, and Gabapentin. In addition, his cyclosporin levels were checked. 3.  Hypo or hyperglycemia:  [**Last Name (un) **] had been following with their appreciated recommendations on glucose control.  Finger sticks were in the 150s when acutely agitated, therefore, it was not determined that glucose levels were contributory. 4.  Infectious causes were evaluated.  He was febrile in the Intensive Care Unit to 101.0 F.; yet, chest x-ray, blood cultures, urinalysis and urine cultures were all negative for sources.  A lumbar puncture was considered, although not performed due to the fact that the cerebrospinal fluid was not breached during the procedure. 5.  Mass effect was considered, although no focal deficits were ever noted on examination and due to the fluctuating sensorium, it was determined that there was no severe underlying structural abnormality.  A head and neck CT scan, non-contrast, were ordered though to evaluate for such processes.  No acute intracranial hemorrhages or midline shifts were noted, although a soft tissue mass was noted at the level of C2.  This was determined to be within the normal expected changes post surgery. 6.  Trauma was also considered.  The patient was found out of bed but no signs of head trauma, no loss of consciousness. Throughout his stay, Chem-10 was monitored.  There were no electrolytes or mineral abnormalities that could explain his delirium.  Liver function tests were checked, only total bilirubin was slightly elevated at 1.6.  TSH was within normal limits as was B12 and folate.  RPR evaluating for possible neurologic syphilis was also checked.  The assay was nonreactive.  An EEG was also considered to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus, although again this did 
This is an 81-year-old female with history of pulmonary hypertension and severe kyphosis, who presents with increasing progressive shortness of breath and acute hypoxia at rehab.  She desaturated to the 60s, but improved on BiPAP.  She has a long history of restrictive lung disease with a FEV1 of 0.42 liters and secondary to her severe kyphoscoliosis also with mild pulmonary hypertension on echocardiogram in [**2638**].  She is on home oxygen. She fell on [**10-5**], and had a left hip fracture status post ORIF here and then went to [**Hospital3 **].  She has not been able to ambulate since that time, and with significant left lower extremity weakness.  She is doing well on Coumadin with goal INR of 1.5 to 2, and getting PT at rehab. She then developed increasing shortness of breath for five days prior to admission.  No complaints of fever, chills, cough with minimal sputum plus postnasal drip.  No change in her lower extremity edema, no calf swelling, and no tenderness at rehab.  She slowly progressed with shortness of breath with increased respiratory rate and desaturations at 79% on 2 liters and up to 86 to 91% on 6 liters.  She was seen by Pulmonary and Cardiology with a gas of pH of 7.35, pO2 of 77, pCO2 of 60 on 4 liters.  She had no EKG changes. She was tried on the BiPAP with better saturations at night as well as with increasing nebulizers.  She was not felt to be a cardiac cause at [**Hospital1 **], and saturations during the day improved to 92% on 3 liters.  She continued on her nightly BiPAP, but today had increasing dyspnea, which was gradual and more q.d. saturations of 64%, was very short of breath.  BiPAP was started bringing saturations up to high 80s and transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]. Her saturations were 90% on BiPAP, given 20 mg of IV Lasix in the ED with good diuresis.  Chest x-ray consistent with CHF on initial presentation. A CTA was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism which was negative, and lungs were fairly clear with small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis after diuresis without signs of pulmonary edema or consolidation.  She was admitted to the MICU on BiPAP for further workup. 
Patient is a 68 yo female with history of PAF/tachy-brady syndrome s/p [**First Name3 (LF) 4388**] and waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 681**] pericardial effusion of unclear etiology who presents with worsening abdominal bloating and DOE x 1 week found to be in AF with RVR and to have worsened pericardial effusion. Patient's history with EP started [**3-4**] when she had a [**Month/Year (2) 4388**] placed for AF/tachy-brady. She was also started on coumadin and sotalol, however the sotalol was stopped [**1-2**] symptoms of worsening right heart failure. TTE showed dilated left and right atria with normal LVEF. In addition, she was noted to have a new small pericardial effusion of unclear etiology which was followed by serial imaging and eventually resolved in the Fall [**3308**]. She states that she was doing well until [**2-3**] when she was admitted for AF with RVR and CHF exacerbation. She was rate-controlled, diuresed, and started on dofetilide and converted to sinus prior to discharge. On follow-up TTE, a small RA lead mass was noted that was thought to be a thrombus and INR goal was increased to 3.5. [**7-6**] TTE revealed the stable RA mass but return of a small pericardial effusion. She resented to clinic on [**10-3**] for follow-up and reported worsening abdominal bloating and DOE. She was able to walk to work prior to [**9-23**] but since this time becomes SOB with minimal exertion. Notes increased ankle edema but no PND or orthopnea. Does occasionally have palpitations. Denies chest pain. Found to have 16mm Hg pulsus paradoxus and worsened pericardial effusion on TTE but no obvious hemodynamic compromise.

Otherwise, he did not have chest pain, difficulty breathing, increased lower extremity edema, vomiting, or diarrhea at home. He did have nausea per his wife. . In the ED: initial vitals were: T 99.3, HR 86, BP 126/73, RR 20, 95% on RA. In the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] U/S was concerning for acute cholecystitis; perforated gallbladder or abscess could not be excluded. Surgery was consulted; it was felt the patient was not a surgical candidate, recommended perc drainage and admission to MICU. Code sepsis was called; he was intubated for airway protection (with etomidate and rocuronium), a central line was placed for access. He was given vancomycin and Zosyn. He was placed on propofol. He is admitted to the MICU for further management. . 
The patient is a 55-year-old white male with a history of severe diabetes mellitus, status post living-related renal transplant plus immunosuppression who presented on [**3165-2-22**], with a 2-day history of fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and decreased p.o. intake in the setting of a nonproductive cough.  On admission the patient was noted to be hemodynamically stable, satting at 97% on room air.  A chest CT performed on admission revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.  On [**2-25**], the patient underwent bronchoscopy which yielded an aspirate that was negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] biopsy that has remained negative to date.  The patient was started on azithromycin at that time for presumed atypical pneumonia.  Over the course of the following three days, serial chest x-rays revealed a progression of the infiltrative process, and the patient's antibiotic coverage was changed to Levaquin.  In addition, on [**2-27**], his respiratory status continued to deteriorate with a decline in oxygen saturation of 89% on 3 liters to 91% on 4 liters.  On [**2-28**], he was satting 87% on 3 liters and 90% to 92% on a nonrebreather.  A chest x-ray at that time revealed a worsening interstitial process (congestive heart failure versus acute respiratory distress syndrome), and the patient was given Lasix 40 mg IV and transferred to the medical intensive care unit for closer monitoring.  He was also started on ceftriaxone for gram-negative coverage. Over the past 36 hours there has been notable in the patient's clinical picture; that is, with regard to his respiratory function, and he has been able to ambulate; although, he still has persistent low-grade fevers. 
This is a 55-year-old male who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**3165-6-13**], for shortness of breath and with a room air oxygen saturation of 72%.  He had been admitted in [**Month (only) 944**] from [**2-22**] to [**3-4**] with hypoxia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.  Work-up at that time involved bronchoscopy which was negative for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 20339**] of tissue eventually grew out alpha Streptococcus.  He improved clinically with diuresis, and an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 40%, anterior septal akinesis, apical akinesis, anterior hypokinesis, and akinesis. Clinically, although he improved with diuresis during that admission, he was treated with Levaquin.  Since that discharge, he has been started on Lasix and Lopressor with cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20340**] on [**3-24**] and [**4-11**]; however, he continued to have increasing lower leg edema. On this admission in the Emergency Department, he arrived with an oxygen saturation of 72%, 92-96% on non-rebreather. An ABG done at that time showed a pH of 7.39, 30, 94 on non-rebreather.  He had transient orthostatic hypotension because he missed his morning dose of Midodrine.  At the time of admission in the Emergency Department, he was noted to be febrile to 101.5??????, otherwise with normal vitals signs.  In the Emergency Department, he was treated with Levaquin, Prednisone, and intravenous Bactrim.  He was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he was diuresed with intravenous Lasix, and urine output to that was over a liter. He became stable at 95% on 4 L with room air oxygen saturations of 88-92%, and the patient himself said that he felt much less short of breath. 
This is a 55 year old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, end stage renal disease, status post living related renal transplant in [**3156**], congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, status post silent myocardial infarction and stent to the left circumflex, who presents with poor appetite times two weeks, decreased urine output over the course of three days, as well as episodic band-like epigastric burning pain in the past couple of days.  He describes the epigastric pain as eight out of ten, nonexertional, band-like burning in the epigastrium radiating around to his back.  This pain is also associated with shortness of breath and mild nausea.  It tends to last twenty minutes, although some episodes have lasted up to three hours.  It also appears to be positional in nature and somewhat relieved by antacids. The patient reports no urine output over the past eighteen hours.  He denies any tenderness over the site of his renal transplant.  He also denies fever, chills and dysuria.  He does report that he recently finished a course of Biaxin which he was taking for mouth infection.  He says that on the day prior to admission he put out only approximately 150 cc of urine.  His creatinine at baseline is 3.0 to 3.5. The patient reports that he has had recurrent episodes of progressive shortness of breath related to his congestive heart failure.  He was admitted to the [**Hospital1 188**] in [**2-18**], with hypoxia and bilateral infiltrates.  Bronchoscopy at that time was negative for PCP but positive for alpha Streptococcus.  There was question of mediastinal adenopathy and ground glass opacities on CT at that time.  He returned to the [**Hospital1 186**] in [**5-18**], with similar symptoms which responded well to antibiotics and diuresis. Echocardiography in [**7-18**], revealed an ejection fraction of 45 to 55%.  Currently he does report shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, however, denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea.  He also reports increased lower extremity edema. 
This is a 57-year-old male with history of insulin dependent diabetes, status post renal transplant in [**3156**], recent admits for fever of unknown origin, who now presents with a three day history of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever of up to 101.8.  As already noted, the patient was recently admitted in late [**Month (only) 354**] for workup of fever of unknown origin including a VATS procedure, and readmitted in mid [**3166-11-18**] with similar complaints without significant elucidation of his fever of unknown origin.  The patient was afebrile for five days prior to discharge. After discharge, the patient had been in his usual state of health until a few nights prior to admission when he noted progressive nausea and vomiting, and inability to tolerate oral intake.  He states that he has not been able to keep anything down, and has noted almost projectile vomiting approximately two hours after ingesting food.  He states that the emesis is compromised of undigested food.  He has been able to drink water and had red jello without any problem. In the Emergency Department, he had laboratories consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis.  He was given 3 liters of intravenous fluids, Phenergan, Zofran, and insulin.  He was transferred to the MICU for management of his diabetic ketoacidosis. 
The patient is a 57-year-old man who presents to the [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**3167-4-27**] after being found unresponsive by his wife.  By report, the patient awoke feeling poorly and had one episode of emesis on the date of admission.  His temperature at that time was 102 degrees (of note the patient has had a long history of fever of unknown origin with an extensive workup including fluoroscopic lung [**Year (4 digits) **]). The patient was found by his wife unresponsive after she left the house to run errands and returned approximately 90 minutes later, he was diaphoretic as well. When the EMS arrived in his home, he had one further episode of emesis, was cyanotic, and had good pulses.  His fingerstick blood glucose was 17.  He received one ampule of dextrose 50. The patient was intubated upon arrival to [**Hospital **] Hospital, and was still unresponsive despite fingerstick blood glucose of 170.  Computed tomography of the head was unrevealing at that time.  He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and was extubated.  He was restless, complained of abdominal pain (but had a benign examination), and had a desaturation of a pulse oxygen to 88% on 100% nonrebreather face mask, and he was reintubated.  The patient received stress dose of steroids as he is on chronic prednisone for his transplant. His BNP was found to be markedly elevated, and he was given a dose of intravenous furosemide. He was started on Unasyn for aspiration pneumonia and had blood and urine cultures attained as well.  He was started on Heparin intravenously for a deep venous thrombosis of his leg as his INR was found to be subtherapeutic. 
Patient is a 58-year-old white male with complicated past medical history including diabetes mellitus type 1, complicated by retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, end-stage renal disease status post living related kidney transplant in [**3156**] now with evidence of chronic rejection, now on hemodialysis, status post peritoneal dialysis catheter placement in [**3167-11-18**], status post recent hospitalizations in [**3167-12-18**] for choledocholithiasis, and cholecystitis status post ERCP and cholecystectomy, presented on [**3168-2-8**] with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and elevated systolic blood pressure. Patient reported that earlier on the day of admission, he had undergone a session of hemodialysis.  While at hemodialysis, his blood pressures elevated to a systolic blood pressure to the 220s.  Per the patient, his baseline systolic blood pressure is closer to 150.  After hemodialysis, later that evening, he had the onset of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis, and diffuse, generalized abdominal pain.  At that time, he had also noted a fever of 102.9 associated with shaking chills. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Upon admission was negative for chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, sputum, sick contacts, rash, medication changes, dysuria, or increased urinary frequency.  Of note, the patient has a history of chronic loose stools secondary to autonomic insufficiency caused by his diabetes.  He also reports intermittent fevers of unclear etiology dating back to his open cholecystectomy on [**3168-1-17**]. While in the Emergency Department, he was noted to have a temperature of 102.0, blood pressure of 227/101, heart rate of 95, respiratory rate of 22, oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.  While in the Emergency Department, he received total hydralazine of 10 mg IV x2, Phenergan 25 mg IV x2, and levofloxacin 500 mg IV x1.  He also received Tylenol 650 mg en route to the Emergency Department. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on [**3168-2-8**], which noted two postoperative fluid collections with internal air bubbles, one in the gallbladder fossa, and the other in the subcutaneous tissue incision line.  Per the [**Location (un) 1116**], could not exclude abscess formation.  There is stable appearance of a transhepatic kidney with one large cyst.  Per Transplant Surgery, the CT findings were consistent with postoperative changes.  However, in light of these findings, the patient was admitted to the Transplant Surgery service, and was started on linezolid and levofloxacin for antibiotic coverage. During the admission, Surgical staff also noted trauma to the right great toe.  He was seen by Podiatry.  Foot x-rays demonstrated evidence of heavy calcification, but there was no evidence of acute fracture in the region of the right great toe.  There was noted an old healed fracture of the fourth metatarsal bone. While on the Surgical service, he continued to spike temperatures to 101.3 and 101.5 while on linezolid and levofloxacin.  He also had irregularities in his blood sugar, for which he is followed by the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes consult service for better blood sugar control.  In light of his complicated medical history and hospital course, he was transferred from the Transplant Surgical service to the Medicine service on [**3168-2-12**]. 
This is a 58-year-old white male with a complicated past medical history including diabetes type 1 with retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, end-stage renal disease status post living related kidney transplant in [**3156**] now with evidence of chronic rejection now on hemodialysis status post peritoneal dialysis catheter placed in [**3167-11-18**].  Patient has had multiple hospitalizations in [**3167-12-18**] for choledocholithiasis and cholecystitis status post ERCP and cholecystectomy. Patient presented on [**3168-3-4**] with complaints of fevers.  Patient underwent abdominal CT scan to look for source of fevers, however, subsequent days patient developed worsening respiratory distress on [**3-6**].  Patient was found to be hypoxic respiratory failure and transferred to the MICU for acute respiratory distress.  Patient was urgently dialyzed in the MICU and respiratory status improved. Upon return to the floor, patient felt well and was breathing comfortably.  Denied any headache, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, was tolerating p.o.  Patient was continued on his regular hemodialysis schedule. 
This is an 83-year-old gentlemen status post Porcine Mitral valve replacement in [**3170**] for severe mitral regurgitation and status post ASD repair in [**3172**] presenting with increasing fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and two pillow orthopnea.  Denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or edema.  No history of transient ischemic attack or CVA.  Ambulates minimally, but denies claudication.  Referred to outpatient cardiac catheterization on [**7-16**] which revealed: 1.  Coronary arteries are normal. 2.  Severe mitral regurgitation. 3.  Severe pulmonary artery hypertension. 4.  Depressed cardiac output with an ejection fraction of 40%. 5.  Decreased left ventricular systolic function from severe mitral regurgitation.

History obtained from medical record and patient. 75 yo man with history of CHF (EF 15%), afib on coumadin, CAD s/p MI, diabetes, HTN, presented from rehab [**5-27**] with altered mental status after recent [**Hospital1 18**] admit [**Date range (1) 20376**] for RLL pna. He had been discharged to rehab on [**5-24**] ([**Hospital1 **] in [**Location (un) 694**]), to complete a 7-day course of vanco/zosyn (last day was to be [**5-29**]). He became increasingly combative and confused at rehab with lethargy. Per Rehab records, patient was noted to have some confusion on [**3337-5-25**]. On [**3337-5-26**] he had a new roommate in his room, who per nursing report was confrontational with the patient. Mr. [**Known patient lastname 20377**] lost a night of sleep and was noted to subsequently have increasing agitation and confusion. Unfortunately, he was given 2mg IV Ativan for his confusion, and continued to be agitated- and became a verbal and physical threat to the staff, requiring administration of a Posey. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-27**] for altered mental status. Per report his daughter noted visual hallucinations for a few weeks prior to admit on risperdal (new med). In the ED to 101.8 rectal and was admitted to the ICU out of concern for sepsis (given WBC 14.8) with altered mental status and lactate of 2.3. Presumed source for infection was persistent pneumonia. He was given meropenum x2 doses only then continued on vanco/zosyn to complete the original course with the addition of azithromycin. He defervesced after admit. Duloxetine and risperdal were held on this admission given mental status change. Currently he is confussed, but does know he is in [**Location (un) 86**] in a hospital ([**Hospital1 749**]), not why he is in the hospital.  He notes cough but no other complaints. Review of his record reveals he was never restarted on an ace inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **] after last discharge. Prior dose reportedly 10mg of diovan daily (?), prior noted to be 20mg. Review of systems: He complains of cough and choking on food but all other review of systems extensively (10 systems) negative.

Patient is a 75 year old man with hx of Afib on Coumadin, ESRD on dialysis, HTN, hyperlipidemia who had an unwitnessed fall while at home today and transported to [**Hospital3 412**] where he was intubated for airway protection and found to have large 5X4cm L ICH with extension into both lateral ventricles and 4th ventricle.  He was transferred here for further evaluation and care.  He was initially seen per NSURG who did not recommend surgical intervention currently hence neurology was consulted. Patient is intubated and sedated and unable to give own hx. Spoke to daughter who is next of [**Doctor First Name **] who reports that she has not seen him for a few weeks but is aware that he was told per PCP (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 9284**]) that he is bound to fall given his overall weakness from co-morbidities including ESRD for which he is getting 3x/week dialysis for the past 1.5 years. There is no report of recent illness or infection but the details are unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] does live alone and independently but girlfriend lives in an apartment a few units down per daughter. Patient's INR was 2.5 at OSH hence he received FFP and Vitamin K. His INR was 2.3 here on arrival hence he received more FFP, Vitamin K and Profiline.  He remains intubated and sedated with repeat head CT showing no enlargement of the head bleed. 
The patient is a 67 -year-old Russian speaking female with a past medical history significant for diabetes type II, congestive heart failure of unknown etiology, and hypertension.  The patient presents with a three day history of progressively worsening shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion, wheezing, nonproductive cough, and fever to 102 F on the day prior to admission.  Per patient's husband, she denies any nausea or vomiting, chills at night, night sweats, or chest pain.  She denies diarrhea. She has been constipated.  The patient does have paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and two pillow orthopnea.  The patient denies dysuria.  Fingersticks at home have been running approximately 200 to 270's.  The patient denies any sick contacts. On the morning of presentation, the patient was noted to be more lethargic by her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] report, her oxygen saturation upon arrival of the EMS, was in the 80's.  The patient was placed on 100% nonrebreather and arrived at [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] where she was noted to be wheezing on examination.  She was given Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers with improvement of her oxygen saturation from 90% to 94%, also on 100% nonrebreather.  She was also administered 40 mg of IV Lasix times two with diuresis of approximately one liter.  The patient denied any chest pain throughout her entire presentation. 
The patient is a 68 year old female with a history of morbid obesity, history of sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction, restrictive lung disease, the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of increasing shortness of breath for four to five days.  The patient had mild productive cough but no fevers or chills.  Prior to her admission on [**3203-12-5**], her O2 saturation dropped from the low-90s which is her baseline, down to 78 to 80% at home with a heart rate in the 130s to 140s. of 99.8 F.; blood pressure 123/70; heart rate 130 to 140; respirations 30; 02 saturation 80% on room air, up to 95% on four to five liters.  She was found to be atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response to the 140s and started on heparin and Diltiazem for rate control. After admission to the Medical Floor on [**3203-12-5**], she required more oxygen to the point of 100% face mask. Arterial blood gas was initially 7.23, 98, 117, 100% non-rebreather mask; 7.25, 95, 58, on 5 liters nasal cannula, to 7.25, 99, 75, on Bi-PAP, then to 7.26, 96, 72, on C-PAP. She was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit on [**3203-12-6**], for cardiac and respiratory failure. Her issues in the Cardiac Care Unit included: 1.      Pulmonary:  Respiratory failure secondary to hypoventilation secondary to morbid obesity in the setting of restrictive lung disease and congestive heart failure.  The patient did not require intubation and continued on Bi-PAP and C-PAP.  She was started on potassium chloride and progesterone to increase her respiratory drive.  On [**3203-12-9**], the patient was started on nasal cannula O2 during the day with continued Bi-PAP at night.  Her O2 saturation on nasal cannula of four to five liters was as low as 90%. 2.      Cardiovascular:  Congestive heart failure; the patient was aggressively diuresed with intravenous Lasix, for a total of nine liters negative while in the Cardiac Care Unit.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  Started on anti-coagulation on Diltiazem and digoxin. 3.      Gastrointestinal:  Constipation; aggressive bowel regimen including Lactulose and GoLYTELY. 4.      Decreased mental status:  Believed to be secondary to hypoxia and hypercarbia, resolved with improved oxygenation.

HPI: Ms [**Known patient lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with AFIB on coumadin and a known paraesophageal hernia who presents with over 24 hours on nausea and vomiting and upper abdominal pain.  She is a poor historian, but states she has never had pain like this before. She states she is passing gas and had a normal BM this AM without blood.  She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadednes, or any other complaints.  She currently states she feels' very sick'. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 48 y/o M with diabetes (diagnosed in [**3-/2795**]), hyperlipidemia, HTN, and newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy who is s/p catheterization.  The patient was initially supposed to have shoulder surgery done this past [**Month (only) 946**], but was found to have elevated sugars and diagnosed with DM.  The surgery was rescheduled for earlier this month, and pre-operative ECHO was done showing biventricular dilation and severe hypokinesis, with mild mitral and moderate tricuspid regurgiation.  There was also evidence of moderate pulmonary artery systolic HTN.  An EF of [**11-4**]% was reported.  Despite this EF, the patient denies any shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, chest pain, or decreased exercise tolerance due to fatigue.  He does have some decreased exercise tolerance, but attributes it to R hip pain not fatigue.  The patient also denies any history of PND or sleep orthopnea.  The only symptoms that the patient does report is leg swelling since [**Month (only) 202**]. On cath, LMCA had distal 50% disease, diffuse LAD disease with 80-90% occlusions in small vessel at mid and distal segments, total occlusion of L cx after large OM1 and diffuse disease in RCA marginal branches. Wedge pressure was 32, PA pressues in 70s, pt was given 40 mg IV Lasix. . On arrival to the floor, patient was stable and CP free. 
50-year-old diabetic gentleman who presented with gangrene of his right 3rd toe on [**2796-10-23**] for which he underwent amputation. Noninvasive arterial studies at that time demonstrated diffuse tibial disease.  He underwent a diagnostic angiography that showed severe disease in his below-knee popliteal artery and tibials with reconstitution of a posterior tibial artery down to his foot which was not amenable to a catheter based intervention.  He, therefore, presented today for an SFA to posterior tibial artery bypass. 
This is a 63-year-old woman who presented with a prior medical history including end-stage renal disease, quadriplegia, osteoporosis, depression, congestive heart failure and diabetes, who presented to the [**Hospital6 253**] on [**8-25**] with symptoms of constipation, decreased appetite, decreased bowel movements and flatus. PHYSICAL EXAM:  She was distended, tender in the abdomen, and an abdominal x-ray revealed a large bowel obstruction.  In addition, her physical exam was notable for decreased motion of the extremities which was consistent with her prior history of being quadriplegic. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was consented and underwent sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy to reveal a sigmoid volvulus. At that time, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 945**] discussed the matter with the patient's family, and consent was obtained for an exploratory laparotomy.  The patient underwent general anesthesia and underwent an exploratory laparotomy, during which an adhesive band about the sigmoid colon was noted.  This band caused a segment of ischemia within the sigmoid colon and was resected, creating a loop sigmoid colostomy. Postoperatively, the patient remained intubated and was transferred to the Trauma Surgical ICU where she remained intubated and under close observation for three days.  On the fourth postoperative day, [**8-29**], the patient was transferred to the floors, and the remainder of her hospital course entailed advancing her diet with tube feeding, total parenteral nutrition, and advancing PO oral intake. Moreover, the patient, during her entire hospital course, underwent dialysis three times a week as per her normal scheduled, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, and was followed, in addition to the surgical team, by the renal team, the neurosurgery team, and the psychiatry team for her various co-morbidities.

Pt is a 54 F with h/o non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, diastolic CHF with EF >55%, MR, severe pulm HTN thought [**3-4**] UIP/IPF on steroids, DM2, HTN, PAF on coumadin, s/p renal Xplant in [**3379**] on IS, who presents from [**Hospital 21676**] Hospital after asystolic arrest. Per report, the patient presented to [**Hospital 1456**] hospital on [**3385-8-13**] after feeling sudden onset of palpitations, chest pain, and SOB. In the ED, she was treated for her CP but was found to be in pulm edema and rapid afib. She was admitted to the ICU for further care, where they aggressively rate controlled her and diuresed her with lasix. Given her rapid afib, the patient was started on sotalol on [**8-15**], where she converted to sinus rythm on [**8-16**]. The patient remained stable until the afternoon of transfer. Per report, the patient subsequently went into asystolic arrest at about 2:30PM on [**8-21**] requiring defibrillation, epi 1mg x4, atropine 1mg x1, vasopressin 40units x1, lidocaine 100mg x1, Amiodarone 150mg x1, bicarb, Ca returning her to sinus rythm. There were no reported shocks. She was intubated during this event and started on dopamine/neo for sbps in the 80s. In the ICU, a PA line was placed demonstrating CVP 16, PAP 85/35 and PCWP 40 with CO 1.4. A R fem A-line was placed, as was a temp pacing wire for bradycardia. The patient was then switched to nitro/levophed and given lasix 100mg IV x1. Bedside echo showed EF 40%. ABG at the time of transfer was 7.35/31/60 on 100% Fi02 and PEEP 5. Due to family request, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was intubated and sedated with possible responsiveness. She arrived on nitro/levophed drip. She was unable to provide history. Also of note, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3385-6-23**] for increased abd girth and SOB thought [**3-4**] CHF exacerbation. She was diuresed at that time with lasix/metolazone. The patient also underwent R heart cath confirming pulm hypertension(RVEDP = 20 mm Hg, mean PCWP 11 mm Hg, pulmonary artery pressure 79/59 mm Hg). She underwent lung biospy and evaluation by pulmonology showing likely UIP/IPF and was started on high dose prednisone. She was also maintained on cytoxan for her renal transplant. ROS: Unable to obtain review of systems due to patient being intubated/sedated. 
This is a 63-year-old gentleman with right carotid stenosis who underwent a right carotid endarterectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. He had a lesion in the distal ICA noted on completion angiography, performed due to poor distal signal. This appeared to be possibly a clamp injury. This was in an area of the ICA that was not surgically accessible and therefore, intraoperative consultation was requested for possible carotid stenting. 
88yo F w/ h/o CAD s/p prior CABG s/p PPM/AICD, Diabetes, BPV and hypertension who presented w/ continued cough, fever, and pleuritic CP. Pt was discharged the day before (admitted from [**Date range (1) 9122**]/09), and was found to have a PNA in the left Lingula. Pt was started on ceftriaxone/azithro and changed to cefpodoxime/azithro to complete a 7d course of abx. Her abdominal pain was also thought to be related to the PNA. Pt also had CP but ROMI, and a mild exacerbation of her dCHF. . She presented this admission with continued cough, fever, and pleuritic CP. Pt also continued to have epigastric pain. Vitals in ED were 99.8, 63, 167/61, 26, 92% on 2.5L. Pt was given cefepime/vanco and 150mEq NaHCO3. Yesterday [**3-24**] Pt's abx were expanded to Vanco/Cefipime to cover for HAP and pt was doing well. Then today, [**3-25**] at 2am, pt noted to have worsening tachypnea pt A/Ox3, SBP 150, hr 90, face mask 5L 98%, rr 42, bil rhonchi, crackles at bases bil, abd soft. Her O2 requirements to 5L.  ABG performed 7.37/42/61, [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] called for transfer, and transferred for BIPAP. . Upon arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] at 320am, SBP 162, rr 38, bipap initiated, tolerated well.  Family contact[**Name (NI) **]: grand-daughter re-confirmed DNR/DNI status. 
91M h/o CAD/CABG, Dementia, who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with fever (101.5) and mild decr of OS (93%) with CXR demonstrating LLL infiltrate. He also had RLE erythema consistent with cellulitis. Pt was given IV levaquin, flagyl, and ancef and was DCed back to NH on PO levaquin/flagyl/keflex. Once at the NH, he had rigors/shaking, hypoxia (OS74%) and he promptly returned to the ED. He received Benzos en transit to the ED for empiric seizure Rx. In the ED, he was lethargic, T104.6, HR110, BP160/100, RR14 and OS100%.  He was intubated emergently for airway protection and was placed on the sepsis protocol. He received ceftriaxone 1 gm IV , vancomycin 1 gm IV, and IVF (total of 5L NS).  A CK was 1012, MB 72 (MBI 7.1) and troponin was 1.31. EKG showed only an old RBBB. Health care proxy met with cardiologist, decided that pt should be DNR and is not cath candidate, but they decided to keep pt intubated. Later in ED, had recurrence of possible seizure activity. He was seen by Neuro: head CT was negative, LP with thousands RBCs (but reported traumatic tap). Pt was started on empiric acyclovir for possible HSV Meningitis. Pt was then sent to [**Hospital Unit Name 152**]. 
67-year-old female with past medical history of severe TBM s/p Y-stent in [**8-12**], severe COPD (on home O2), CAD s/p MI, CHF, hypertension, and severe anxiety, now transferred from [**Hospital 1543**] Hospital with COPD exacerbation and aspergillus in her sputum. She has had frequent hospitalizations in the past few months for dyspnea and COPD exacerbations. During these episodes, she reports copious, thin secretions with an inability to cough. She most recently was admitted to [**Hospital 1543**] Hospital on [**2637-11-18**] for COPD exacerbation and underwent bronchoscopy to remove secretions. Initial bacterial studies revealed colonization w/aspergillus and [**Female First Name (un) **], no infection, no atypical cells, no evidence of HSV or AFB. CXR had revealed severe COPD with no infiltrates. At this time, she was continued on her regimen of aerosol treatment, started on Solu-Medrol, and placed on levaquin for possible infectious etiology of acute bronchitis. She was discharged on [**2637-11-23**]. On [**2637-12-4**] she was readmitted to [**Hospital 1543**] Hospital for shortness of breath, fever (temp=101.2 F), and chills. She was started on voriconazole for positive aspergillus culture from sputum, and subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management, including rigid bronchoscopy and removal of Y-stent. 
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 20455**] is a 75-year-old female with a history of insulin dependent diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity, coronary artery disease, status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2601-5-19**], paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure with normal ejection fraction who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation and therapy of acute renal failure, [**Last Name (un) 3644**] syndrome and persistent ventilator dependence with metabolic acidosis and resolving Klebsiella urosepsis. Patient initially presented to [**Hospital1 186**] on [**2601-5-8**] for evaluation of congestive heart failure and was found to have severe three vessel disease by cardiac catheterization.  She underwent three vessel coronary artery bypass graft on the [**5-12**] with initial postoperative complication of pneumonia and urinary tract infection that were treated with Ciprofloxacin.  She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further rehabilitation on the [**4-23**].  There, she developed left lower lobe pneumonia and sternal wound infection/dehiscence which grew out staphylococcus and enterococcus.  She was started on levofloxacin and vancomycin, and then transferred back to the SICU at [**Hospital3 **] on [**5-26**] for further evaluation and management.  There, she was found to have a left pleural effusion that required placement of a chest tube.  On the [**5-28**], she was taken to the Operating Room for debridement and flap reconstruction over her sternal wound. Her postoperative course after this procedure was complicated by pressor requirements, persistent hypoxia and metabolic alkalosis of unclear etiology treated with diamox.  Also, she failed extubation and underwent a percutaneous tracheostomy on the [**6-12**], and several bronchoscopies were significant only for chronic inflammatory changes.  During this period, she also developed left arm weakness which was evaluated by Neurology.  Their differential was a brachial plexopathy versus cord injury versus a right MCA stroke. She was discharged at [**Hospital1 **] again on the [**6-17**] with a PICC line in place and her flaps intact.  Her total course of intravenous vancomycin was scheduled for six weeks. While at the rehabilitation facility, she developed multiple medical issues that complicated her management. 1.  [**Last Name (un) 3644**] syndrome:  On [**6-30**], she developed increasing abdominal distention, discomfort and occasional emesis on tube feeds.  Gastrointestinal evaluated her the [**7-7**] and recommended bowel arrest, rectal and nasogastric tube decompression.  A KUB on [**7-13**] showed that the cecum was still dilated to 16.5 cm and so she was continued NPO.  Her exam had no improved at the time of transfer to Medical Intensive Care Unit. [**Unit Number **].  Klebsiella urosepsis:  Patient apparently had intermittent temperature spikes with leukocytosis concerning for continued sternal wound infection.  Vancomycin was continued past the six week course but on [**7-13**], she was started on levofloxacin and Flagyl for broader coverage.  The Flagyl was begun for concern of toxic megacolon.  On [**7-16**], both urine and [**4-22**] blood culture bottles grew out generally pansensitive Klebsiella pneumonia.  She was given a single dose of gentamicin on the 28th and vancomycin was discontinued secondary to worsening renal failure. Levofloxacin and Flagyl were continued.  At the time of transfer back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, it was felt that her sepsis was resolving. 3.  Acute renal failure:  Creatinine on [**7-9**] was 0.8.  On [**7-16**], it was 3.0 and on [**7-20**] was 5.0.  While at [**Hospital1 5519**], she was seen by the renal attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Her urinalysis at the time was notable for granular casts.  It was the feeling of the renal team, that Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 20455**] had developed acute renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis induced by sepsis and intravascular depletion.  She was started on a Lasix drip and renal dosed dopamine.  The documentation is unclear, but she appears to have been anuric for some time but on the [**8-17**], her urine output is noted to be 300-400 cc.  While she was at the rehabilitation facility, an ultrasound was obtained that showed no evidence of hydronephrosis but there was a question of horseshoe kidney. 4.  Ventilatory dependence:  The patient has been unable to be weaned off the ventilator for unclear reasons. PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.9 (rectal).  Heart rate 64.  Blood pressure 117/42. Respiratory rate 14.  Oxygen saturation 100% ventilatory setting:  SIMV 14/750/5/5/30%.  General:  She was alert and oriented times three in no acute distress.  The tracheostomy 
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 20455**] is a 75 year old woman from [**Hospital1 693**] admitted on [**2601-8-22**] for evaluation for the question of dialysis.  The patient was last admitted to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3811**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2601-7-21**] for workup of new onset acute renal failure, urosepsis, [**Last Name (un) 3644**] syndrome and chronic ventilatory dependence.  She was discharged to [**Hospital1 20458**] without dialysis as there was no indication then for dialysis. The patient's acute renal failure continued to worsen and she had a question of altered mental status, leading to this readmission, for workup of uremic encephalopathy and the requirement of dialysis.  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit because of ventilator dependence at night. ACTIVE ISSUES: 1.  Acute renal failure:  The patient had hyperkalemia on admission, which resolved with a Kayexalate enema and Lasix. She was evaluated by the renal service and started bedside hemodialysis through a femoral line on [**2601-8-24**].  No improvement of mental status was noticed after two days of dialysis. A family meeting was held on [**2601-8-23**] with the patient's sister, who is her health care proxy, regarding the goals of our care for the patient.  We discussed at length regarding the need for hemodialysis, the need for a permanent catheter to be placed and regarding the overall prognosis of Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 20455**].  The patient's family decided to give her a trial of hemodialysis from her femoral line and observe what benefit it will bring, then they will decide regarding chronic hemodialysis.  Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 20455**] had minimal mental status improvement after two days of hemodialysis.  The patient's family decided on [**2601-8-25**] that they would not consent to further procedures or hemodialysis and would want only comfort measures for Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 20455**].  Hemodialysis was stopped on [**2601-8-25**]. 2.  Ventilatory status:  The patient was placed on 12 hours off ventilator wean on her first day, and was noted to have some apneic episodes and appear labored in her breathing.  We therefore placed her on 24 hour PSV then switched to AC in order to better ventilate her and to rule out any hypoxia, hypercarbia as a cause of her altered mental status.  The patient's family had decided on comfort measures only on [**2601-8-26**].  The patient was then taken off the ventilator that afternoon and given oxygen over her tracheostomy mask.  She was not to be put on ventilator support from now on.  The patient is to receive morphine if she appears distressed from breathing. 3.  Urinary tract infection:  On admission, a urinalysis was sent and the patient was found to have plenty of bacteria and yeast in her urine.  Later, the urine culture came back to show Klebsiella pneumoniae, sensitive to Bactrim.  The patient is now treated, day number five of Bactrim DS on discharge. 4.  Diabetes/hyperglycemia:  The patient had been hyperglycemic during this admission, likely secondary to her urinary tract infection.  As the patient is now only comfort measures, she is getting her daily NPH at the same dose as on transfer, but no more daily fingersticks to check her blood sugar level. 5.  Nutrition:  The patient is to receive no intravenous fluids.  She received 35 cc/hour of Nepro tube feeds and 250 cc of free water bolus through her nasogastric tube every day.  The family has not yet decided whether to stop tube feeding her and to remove her nasogastric tube. 6.  Altered mental status:  A CT scan was performed for further evaluation of possible causes of the patient's mental status alteration and potential prognostication in terms of neurological status.  A CT scan of the head showed no acute infarction or hemorrhage, with small vessel disease in the periventricular white matter and an old putamen infarction. 7.  Cardiovascular status:  An echocardiogram was performed to evaluate the cardiovascular status of Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 20455**]. Results showed a mildly dilated left atrium and right atrium, otherwise no change from patient's echocardiogram on [**2601-4-8**]. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Acute renal failure. Diabetes mellitus. Urinary tract infection. Tracheostomy. CODE STATUS:  "Do Not Resuscitate"/"Do Not Intubate". 
The patient is an 83-year-old woman whose problems began with chronic back pain usually controlled with Tylenol.  She noted an exacerbation on [**3093-1-8**] and was admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 614**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for low back pain.  During her work-up there she received an x-ray which confirmed a compression fracture at the L3 level.  She was managed conservatively with physical therapy.  The patient did, however, develop chest pain and shortness of breath on [**3093-1-11**].  Ultimately, the patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 120 and a peak troponin of 5.0.  The patient was treated per their protocol with Lovenox and Plavix, given her allergy to aspirin.  She was continued on her other cardiac medications including nitrates, beta blockade and ACE inhibitor.  The patient was diuresed and symptomatically improved within 12 hours.  There was discussion about cardiac catheterization but given resolution of symptoms, the patient deferred the option of cardiac catheterization.  The patient was transferred back to her [**Hospital3 **] facility and was otherwise asymptomatic until [**3093-1-20**] when the patient developed persistent severe chest pain in the morning.  The patient also had palpitations.  She was brought in at that time for probable cardiac catheterization and evaluation of her chest pain. 
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus with a previous hospitalization at an outside hospital with recurrent nausea and vomiting.  This was associated with a fluttering in the chest.  She was ruled out for an myocardial infarction. Electrocardiogram was without significant changes and an echocardiogram on that admission showed an ejection fraction of 50% and mild mitral regurgitation.  Gastrointestinal, she revealed gastroparesis.  She was discharged and ten days later, was readmitted again for severe nausea and vomiting and symptoms of pulmonary edema and fluttering in her chest. An ETT thallium done during that admission revealed mild left ventricular dilatation with stress and an ejection fraction of 38%.  Imaging revealed a fixed apical defect along anterior and along anterior wall.  Subsequent to that, she was discharged.  An echocardiogram done on [**3258-4-16**] showed an ejection fraction of 50%, no significant valve disease and borderline pulmonary arterial hypertension. Since the episode, she has had no similar symptoms.  Denies any chest discomfort.  She has noticed though an increase in dyspnea on exertion.  She must stop several times to rest when walking short distances. She now presented to [**Hospital6 1739**] for further work-up. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 43 y/o man with ESRD on HD s/p recent removal of transplant nephrectomy in [**8-15**], HTN, and hepatitis C who presents with ongoing abdominal pain, hematuria, and difficulty breathing. The patient notes ongoing right lower quadrant abdominal pain at site of nephrectomy (done in [**8-15**]) since surgery. No real change in pattern or quality of pain. Pain located directly over site of surgical incision. No diarrhea or vomiting but nauseated. No increase in pain today. Has also had hematuria since his nephrectomy last month without change. Hematoma was visualized at nephrectomy site on CT done [**3462-8-29**]. Also complaining of dysuria with subjective fevers at home with unclear timeline (states that subjective fevers have occurred since his prior hospitalization). . In addition, patient notes recent orthopnea and increasing dyspnea at rest. He did not go to dialysis today (usual T,Th,Sat). Has not missed any doses of medication per his report. He denies increased salt intake. He endorses chest pain while "fatigued" but does not further characterize. Reports no chest pain at rest. No palpitations. Has chronic right lower extremity edema per his report. No chest pain currently. . On arrival to our ED, the patient's initial vitals were T 98.2, HR 80, BP 152/106, RR 16, 100% on RA. BP in the ED ranged from 160s-170s systolic. He desaturated to 90 and then in to the 80s with sleeping and was placed on a NRB mask with improvement in sats to 100%. He received 2 mg IV morphine X 1 for abdominal pain. CXR demonstrated volume overload; renal was contact[**Name (NI) **] for possible dialysis tonight. Transplant surgery was also consulted given his recent nephrectomy. . ROS: + subjective fevers at home. No weight changes. No chills.

Pt is 43 yo M with PMHx sig. ESRD s/p failed transplant and subsequent nephrectomy in [**8-15**] who p/w abdominal pain. He was recently hospitalized from [**Date range (3) 20477**] for worsening dyspnea and abdominal pain. He was admitted to the MICU for urgent HD as he missed his previous HD session. He also developed chest pain attributed to new onset systolic CHF (?SIRS related to graft rejection and recent nephrectomy, ischemia, or high output failure form AV fistula) and pericarditis [**2-8**] uremia. The abdominal pain was felt to be localized over the nephrectomy site, and serial exams did not show a surgical abdomen. He was noted to have new isolated elevated AST; an abdominal US did not show gallbladder pathology. It did show 4.7 x 2.2 x 2.9 cm thick-walled fluid collection in RLQ, decreased in size from [**3462-8-29**]. Pt was treated with acetaminophen and low dose IV morphine. His course with comblicated by gram-positive bacteremia, likely from HD line. He was treated with vancomycin for 2 week course. . He returns today with worsening abdominal pain, now for past 3 weeks, and poor appetite. . In the ED, initial vital signs were: . He had an abdominal CT scan that showed no infectious processes. The CT scan did show new ascites and pericardial effusion, which was not seen on cardiac MRI on [**3462-9-29**]. Cardiology performed a bedside ECHO that showed large effusion but NO cardiac tamponade physiology. His P stable. Pulsus is 6. The plan is to have cardiology take him to the cath lab tomorrow. Renal has been notified of his arrival and will likely need to dialysis him post-cath. Of note, his CT scan was complicated by infiltration of his IV. About 70 cc of contrast was run into his arm. Per protocol, plastic surgery was consulted to eval for compartment syndrome. Plastics felt exam was benign and recommended warm compresses. . On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

In ED, SBP initially 140s, and pt was briefly started on ntg gtt for thought of flash pulm edema. EKG revealed widened QRS, K noted to be 6.0, given bicarb, insulin, d50, calcium. Initial ABG 7.26/33/487/15 -> 7.37/34/476/20, following initiating bipap and receiving bicarb. AG 29. . CXR in ED notable for pulmonary vascular congestion, but no overt failure or infiltrate. . Noted in ED to have WBC of 25.8 63PMN, 1 band, 2 atyps, 1 metas, 2 myelos. Prior to transfer to MICU, patient noted to have SBP of 100s-110s. 
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a past medical history of CAD, NQWMI, status post two vessel CABG plus AVR ([**2685**]) and DC cardioversion, [**2698-4-21**], who presented to the ER with a two-day history of dyspnea and PND.  The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and underwent DC cardioversion on [**2698-4-21**].  The patient was hypotensive following the cardioversion and required per report up to 7 liters of saline, accompanied by a weight change of approximately 9 pounds (from 186 pounds to 195 pounds).  The patient states that he was feeling well prior to the DC cardioversion and that subsequently had dyspnea on exertion as well as shortness of breath at rest. The patient stated that he had approximately 3-4 episodes of PND over the 2 nights prior to admission.  He also had 1 brief episode of substernal chest pain that lasted 2-3 minutes the day prior to admission at 2:00 p.m. that began when he went from a sitting to a standing position and resolved spontaneously. He describes the chest discomfort as central, substernal, sharp, non-radiating, non-pleuritic and this is not associated with diaphoresis, palpitations, nausea or vomiting.  He does deny lower extremity edema and denies having any significant history of angina since his CABG in [**2685**].  On further review of systems, the patient admits to having upper respiratory tract infection symptoms over the past 3-4 days including cough productive of clear white sputum.  There were no fever, chills, diarrhea, headache, rash or arthralgia.  The patient, of note, has a significant EtOH history and drinks up to 8 beers per day.  His last drink was at 6:00 p.m. on the day prior to admission. In the emergency department the patient received 40 mg of Lasix, supplemental oxygen, 325 mg of aspirin and was started on nitroglycerin drip.  His ECG showed sinus bradycardia with PR prolongation, as well as left ventricular hypertrophy and atrioventricular conduction delay and diffused ST and T-wave changes, (there was no significant change in comparison with the prior ECG of [**2698-4-21**]).  The patient's chest film was consistent with mild CHF.  An echocardiogram revealed mild symmetric LVH with an EF of 50 to 55 percent and mechanical aortic valve prosthesis with 1 plus AR and 1 plus MR. 
This is an 80-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for hypertension and atrial fibrillation who was recently admitted from [**2580-10-29**] to [**2580-11-1**] with syncope thought to be secondary to dehydration. He returned to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department with the acute onset of weakness and an inability to get out of bed. The patient had been in his usual state of health until the morning of presentation to the Emergency Department.  He had noted fecal incontinence associated with urination (approximately six to seven times per day for the past five to six days) and now two to three times per day for the past two days.  He awoke on the morning of presentation with urinary and fecal incontinence during the night. In the Emergency Department, his blood pressure was found to be 89/54 initially responsive to intravenous fluids. However, despite giving three liters of intravenous fluids his blood pressure remained 85 to 115/50 to 60.  He also continued to be tachycardic in the low 100s.  He was given 500 mg intravenously of Levaquin times one for a question of urosepsis, given that the urinalysis showed positive leukocyte esterase. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems, the patient complained of chills, but no fevers.  He denied any rigors, decrease in oral intake, chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, nuchal rigidity, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, lower extremity edema, urinary symptoms, bright red blood per rectum, and melena. 
Pt is a 76 yo female with h/o DM, CAD (cath '[**96**]-> 40% distal LMCA, 60% mRCA, mild LAD and Cx disease) previously managed medically, HTn and s/p AV pacer for unspecified bradyarrythmia who presented from OSH for emergent cath with STE inferior MI. Recent history includes a nuclear stress test on [**3302-6-25**] showing a small, mild, fixed apical defect.  Pt describes several weeks of chest pain for which she attributed to a chest cold which became increasingly severe until initial presentation on [**9-18**]. Pt was found to be hypertensive (192/94) hyperglycemic (648), CPK [**3304**], MB 177 and trop 4.36.  ECG was paced but showed evidence of possible ST depressions inferiorly.  Immediately upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], Pt underwent catherization which was significant for thrombotically occluded mid RCA lesion which was Cypher stented times two, as well as 40%LMCA and diffuse disease elsewhere.  Hemodynamics showing RA 15, PCMP 21, CO 2.1, CI 1.3. Echo: EF25% with 3+MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 17356**] transfered to CCU for close observation and management. 
This a 68-year-old gentleman who had a right femoral above-knee popliteal artery bypass performed with a prosthetic graft on [**2932-12-8**].  The graft required a stent placement postoperatively.  Ultimately, he developed an open wound at the level of the popliteal exposure, a graft infection with severe Staphylococcus bacteremia, and nearly died as result of multisystem organ failure of sepsis.  He subsequently recovered from that; but has still had a nonhealing wound in his groin, and a draining sinus at his popliteal space.  A CT angiogram showed that his graft was nearly eroding through the skin, and that there was a stent in it, making it somewhat rigid.  It was also very redundant, and there was a large inflammatory mass around it.  An arteriogram showed that his the below-knee popliteal artery was a suitable target with anterior tibial and posterior tibial runoff distally.  His right saphenous vein had previously been partially harvested. 
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of hypertension without presented to [**Hospital1 69**] with congestive heart failure.

The patient is a 68-year-old male who was first diagnosed with male diagnosed breast cancer in [**2879-6-14**]. During his course of the evaluation, he underwent a chest and abdominal CT that was performed on [**2879-7-28**], which demonstrated a left breast mass measuring 2.1 x 1.7 cm. Also work-up included a CT of the abdomen demonstrating a metastatic tumor. The CT of the abdomen demonstrated a 2.8 x 3.7 cm lesion in the segment VI of the liver, and a 3.9 x 4.1 cm mass in the midpole of the right kidney. On [**2879-8-8**], a PET scan was performed demonstrating a left breast FDG avid mass, and an anterior midpole right renal mass that is FDG avid, and a large non-FDG avid mediastinal lymph node. Biopsy was performed of the right renal mass on [**2879-9-5**], demonstrating no evidence of malignancy, but a fine- needle aspirate was positive for renal cell carcinoma. On [**2879-9-29**], a core liver biopsy of the liver mass was performed demonstrating moderately to poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Follow-up MRI was performed on [**2879-9-27**], demonstrating a 3.3 x 2.5 cm lesion, segment V and VI, of the liver, and 3.5 x 4.0 cm lesion in the right kidney. Part of the work-up included head CT on [**2879-9-27**], which was negative for metastatic disease. The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a possible hepatic resection.

The pt is a 55-yo man, Type 1 Diabetic with frequent hypoglycemic episodes, ERSD, and HTN, who was found unresponsive in the waiting room at Josline Diabetes Center. He had a FSBS of 20 on the scene, and was given Glucagon and 1 amp of D50 without effect on his mental status. He was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, where his FSBS was 150s-170s, but he remained unresponsive (GCS 3). He proceeded to develop seizure-like activity including tonic movements of his abdominal muscles and limbs. Head CT at the time was normal, and he was intubated for airway protection. Labs revealed renal failure with Cr 5.5, hyperkalemia (K 6.2), and negative serum and urine tox screens. Studies were otherwise normal, including ECG, CXR, and UA. VS in the ED - afeb (normothermic), BP 107/66, HR 55, O2-sat 100% on CMV - 500x14/5/100% FiO2. He is admitted to the ICU for further care. In the ICU: Pt was found to be hypothermic to 93 F, with continued seizure-like activity of the extremities. He was placed on a bear-hugger, but he remained unresponsive to any stimulation. Given his fluctuating neurological exam, the pt was sent for a repeat Head CT, which was unchanged. 
Mr [**Known patient lastname **] is a 53 yo M with PMH sig for long-standing DM I c/b insulin autoimmune syndrome in recent years, systolic CHF, and CRI who was found unresponsive at home with fs 29. .

Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 55 year old male with a history of type 1 diabetes complicated by chronic kidney disease, multiple episodes of hypoglycemia attributed to insulin receptor autoantibody syndrome now on immunosuppression who is admitted to the MICU for altered mental status. On the morning of admission, patient was found in his bed unresponsive by his family. EMS was called and upon arrival FSBG was 20.  He received 1 amp of D50 and according to EMS reports, he was briefly responsive but again became upresponsive and was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. . Of note, he has been admitted to the hospital multiple times for altered mental status which has required intubation in the past. Many times this is due to hypoglycemia and mental status typically improves with correction of his hypoglycemia. He was most recently admitted [**Date range (1) 20597**] to the general medical service for hypoglycemia and mental status improved rapidly. Prior to this admission he was admitted at the end of [**10/3308**] where he was followed by endocrinology and rheumatology and he was initiated on azathioprine for his insulin receptor autoantibody syndrome and received a course of prednisone. On his most recent admission he was continued on his azathioprine and prednisone without change. . In the ED, T<96 rectal, 193/91, 78, 14, 100% NRB. Exam showed PERRL, clenched jaw so gag could not be performed, and he was not withdrawing to painful stimuli. FSBG in ED was normal at 139.  Subsequent checks remained normal at 96 and 104.  Despite normal FSBGs he remained unresponsive.  He received a dose of narcan without improvement. He had abnormal movements in the ED, seizures vs shivering and he received 2 mg of ativan without significant change. On a recent trip to the ED, he required intubation by anesthesia for a difficult airway and anesthesia was called today. However, once anesthesia arrived, patient sat up in bed and was conversant, A+Ox3. ROS was negative at that time. He remained somnolent in the ED but was easily arousable so he was not intubated as it was felt he was protecting his airway. ABG 7.38/49/248 on 3LNC. Labs remarkable for Hct of 23(within recent baseline), electrolytes normal with the exception of BUN/Cr of 117/6.5 (baseline Cr 5.5-6), lipase of 204, CK 367 with normal MBI (MB 11). Serum tox screen was negative. ECG, CXR, and CT head were unremarkable. He was initially started on D5NS @ 100 cc/hr which was changed to D5W prior to transfer given h/o chronic kidney disease. . On arrival to the ICU, patient is obtunded. Unresponsive to pain and sternal rub.  Cannot be aroused. ROS cannot be obtained. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 56 yoM with brittle Type I DM c/b insulin antibodies, retinopathy & nephropathy, who was found at home unresponsive with core body temperature of 32 degrees celsius and a fingerstick glucose of 33 (his home HD clinic called EMS when he did not show up for his scheduled HD session).  There was also concern upon arrival he was having a tonic seizure. Unclear course in the field. Of note, he has had multiple episodes of severe hypoglycemia complicated by prfoundly altered mental status.  During the most recent of these episodes in [**8-/3309**] he was found to be bacteremic and was treated with two weeks of vancomycin (last dose to be given [**3309-9-26**] per DCS).  A diagnosis of "bacteremia" was listed on discharge paperwork; [**Month/Day/Year **] cultures from [**3309-10-21**] grew Staph epi; subsequent cultures were negative.  He was discharged to rehab. In the ED, he was groggy but arousable initially and then had a tonic clonic seizure.  He was given ativan 1 mg x 2 with seizure termination, but he was intubated (with rocuronium + etomidate) for concern for airway protection.  He received an amp of D50 as well as IV thiamine.  This raised his fingerstick glucose to 175 mg/dl. 
This 65 year old male hyperlipidemia who was seen for the evaluation of his coronary artery disease in early [**Month (only) 1082**]. At that time a cardiac catheterization revealed three vessel disease with depressed left ventricular function. He has been scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery on [**2842-1-31**] and returns today for preadmission testing. In the interim he has felt well without chest pain or significant dyspnea. His chronic edema has been very mild. 
93 M with h/o CAD, MI, and pacemaker presents with periprosthetic L femur fracture after mechanical fall at home early this morning. No precipitating symptoms; specifically no CP, SOB, N/V. No head trauma or LOC. Transferred from OSH. Patient c/o L buttock pain, better after Percocet and Morphine in ED. 
HPI: 94M with PMH notable for CAD, CHF (EF 20-25%) was brought to the ED this morning by his family with whom he lives. Prior to this morning, the pt was at his baseline, and had taken a number of day trips with his fmaily over the past 2 weeks.  This morning, the pt's granddaughter went to his basement apt to look in on him (his son and son's famly live upstairs) and found that he was trembling and a bit confused. The pt's son then assessed his father, and gave him Benadryl (1 tab) for the shaking. He was sweating and clammy, but his temp later was >102 po The pt then took his usual am meds with Glucerna, but vomited a frothy emesis. He was then transported to the ED. . Per the pt's family, he had been feeling fine prior to this morning. he had not complained of cough or SOB, nor had he mentioned difficulty voiding or dysuria. His son empties a bedside commode in the am for him, and has identified past UTIs by malodorous urine, which he did not identify today. He had not complained of CP or SOB. No GI sx, no bowel changes, no previous fever/chills/malaise. He had not c/o HA or neck stiffness, or pain of any kind. Pt had no recent exotic travel or known sick contacts. . In the ED, the pt was initially stable but satting 84% RA. ON MD exam, sat improved (?on NC), but temp was 104 with HR 60s, BP 134/61. He was minimally responsive (s/p benadryl) and exam was notable for bibasilar rales. Because he was obtunded and had ememis in ED with ?aspiration, he was intubated for airway protection and quickly became hypotensive (BP min 105/50 prior to sedation). He received 5L NS boluses (levophed started after 3L), as well as 2 g CTX, 1 gm vanc, 500 mg metronidazole, 1 g tylenol, etomidate, succinylcholine, 10 mg dexamethasone, 2mg midazolam x 2, levophed gtt, propofol gtt. He was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for further therapy and monitoring. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 20623**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with PMH significant for DM, BPH s/p TURP, and remote low grade TCC s/p resection, who presents with a chief complaint of gross hematuria. He had previously been in his USOH until he began to have blood in his urine last night. He denies dysuria, changes in frequency of urination, difficulty voiding, pain with voiding, or abdominal pain. He had a urinary tract infection several months ago which presented with hematuria. He denies any fevers, chills, abdominal pain. . In the ED, the patient had a urinalysis, which showed trace leukocytes, large blood, and few bacteria. He was also found to have a white count of 13.4. He received 1 gram ceftriaxone IV. Urology was consulted. . Hospital course: Patient was seen and examined by the [**Doctor Last Name **] medicine team. At approximately 1:00 AM, the team was called to the room for a "code blue." The patient had been sitting on the side of the bed to have a bowel movement and apparently collapsed in the son's arms. The code team arrived, and found the patient awake. Vital signs were immediately taken, pacer pads were placed on the patient's chest, and a nasal cannula was placed on the patient's nose. A BP was not able to be obtained initially, but he had 2+ bilateral pedal pulses. The patient was oriented to self, and responding appropriately. Fingerstick glucose was measured to be 117. Repeat Hct had just returned at 35, which was a 3 point Hct drop from the ER. A fluid bolus of 500 cc NS was given. The decision was made with the MICU team to get an EKG, which did not show new ST changes compared with an old EKG. The attending was called, and the decision was made to keep the patient on the floor on telemetry. . 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 74 yo male with known long standing DM II, and chronic non-healing ulcers of the LE's bilaterally.  Patient has several ulcers of the anterior tibias, calves and dorsum of the feet. Patient states that he recently had an open aortic valve replacement at [**Hospital6 **] in [**2848-7-31**] (porcine).  After this, he was sent to a cardiac rehab where he was noted to have worsening LE edema and ulcers of the calves and shins.  These were debrided and UNABOOTS were applied to the legs.  On removal of the unaboots, there was worsening of the ulcerations and the toes became more discolored. He has a history of PVD, and underwent LLE angiogram with Left AT angioplasty in [**2846**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He most recent NIVS showed B/L tibial disease.  On the day of admission, he came from wound care clinic where his affected toes were noted to be black and bleeding and he was admitted to the vascular service. . While on the vascular service he was felt to have non healing ulcers, necrotic toes and likely venous insufficency. He was started on vanco, cipro, and flagyl. He underwent angiography on [**2-26**] which revealed severe PVD and bilateral lower extremity ischemia with gangrene.  The decision was made to observe for improvement while on antibiotics. . Patient had a witnessed syncopal episode and was found to be immediately non-responsive, pulseless.  A cold Blue was called. CPR was initiated. Initial rhythm strip in code showed V. Fib and patient was shocked x1. Received 1 dose epi, and 2 grams magnesium for prolonged QT and possible torsades. Patient was intubated for airway protection and to allow for vascular access to be obtained as he was agitated. Femoral line was placed. Initial ECG post-code showed no ST/T changes c/w ischemia. Patient was transferred to ICU for management. . EP was consulted and felt that his arrest was most likely secondary to underlying familial prolonged QT syndrome in setting of fluoroquinolone use, so ciprofloxacin was stopped. His antibiotic regimen was changed to vancomycin and meropenem. There were no deep tissue cultures to tailor therapy but tissue swabs grew diptheroids, citrobacter, staph, bacteroides.  A urine culture from a foley also grew citrobacter. He was rapidly extubated without difficulty. Cardiac markers remained negative. Was initially bradycardic after resuscitation, although this normalized with discontinuation of propofol sedation and extubation. . His lower extremities did not improve substantially on antibiotics and he underwent right second toe amputation and left fourth toe amputation on [**3-4**].  He also had debridement of bilateral venous stasis ulcerations. He was eventually called out of the ICU and had an ICD placed on [**3-8**].  He was then transferred to the medicine service. 
Pt. is a 69 y/o retired economics professor [**First Name (Titles) 1009**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1811**] L radical nephrectomy in [**2982**]. Pathologic exam at the time revealed renal cell carcinoma, stage T1a and T1b, of clear cell and papillary types. An MRI performed on [**2986-11-23**] revealed an enlarging nodular enhancing complex cyst in the right kidney with negative lymph nodes and adrenal gland. 
89yoF Russian speaking with CAD, EF 45% on last echo [**3-/2816**], HTN, AFib on Coumadin who was admitted to Cardiology [**2821-7-19**] for progressive SOB/DOE for the past [**12-24**] wks, progressing to SOB at rest; also with increased wt, upper and lower extremity swelling, PND, orthopnea such that has been sleeping straight up; but no CP, syncope, or palpitations. Failed outpt management of CHF exacerbation with increase of PO Lasix 60 mg to 120mg. VNA noted low O2 sats, sent her to [**Hospital 189**] clinic where she had cyanotic lips, and then sent to ED where she was 121/68 p76 and 100% on 4L NC. CXR consistent with a very large heart, bilateral patchy opacities and L > R pleural effusion; also with BNP 5500 (no baseline) and Cr 2.3 up from 1.7 back in [**2-/2821**], and baseline appears to be mid 1's. . She was given 80 mg IV Lasix in the ED, and through admission to Cardiology was given 60 mg IV Lasix instead of the intended 120 mg IV due to concern for hypoTN. Review of her floor vitals shows progressive decrease in her SBP's from 110's to 90's, reported 70's by the primary team this am, and is 85 on evaluation most recently. . Through her course, she was diuresed as above; ACEi, beta blocker, and Coumadin have been held; echo has just been done this am; CE's have been trended which are only minimally elevated Trop's (0.1-0.11) with negative MB's. There was also of note a concern for LLL PNA vs atelectasis for which she was given IV Levaquin x1, but this was not continued on the floor (she denies cough, fever, and WBC's are low) . She is transferred to CCU for aggressive monitoring of blood pressure while being diuresed. . ROS as above, otherwise negative.

She has frank melena on guiaic, and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 738**] records has a HCT drop from 26-->23. A RIJ was placed, and her CXR was read as her continuing to have a PNA present. Her NG lavage showed coffee grounds which cleared after ~500cc. GI was consulted, and agreed with a PPI, reversal of her INR, and transfer to the ICU in case of further deterioration. . 84 y/o has been at a nursing home or rehab faciilty, was transferred there with a recent discharge of PNA and COPD, and HCT was 26 -->23, retching and with melanotic stool, and was 3 points lower, and she was very dehydrated looking on her chemistry. Is having a decent amount of melena, cleared 500. No history GI bleed. GI said bolus and gtt, and since cleared quickly, and relatively close hct to baseline, they wouldn't do anything acutely. HR in the 80s (beta blocked) low 90s/40s for BP, similar to sick baseline from prior,a nd still has PNA from CXR. Started Vitamin K 5 mg, INR 1.7. No blood yet, not FFP. NPO overnight. . She was recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 1498**] service, and subsequently transferred to the CCU during an admissionf rom [**Date range (1) 20649**]. During this admission, she had presented with Acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation; she required transfer to the CCU for hypoTN where CVL was placed and she was started on lasix drip and required dopamine drip [**12-23**] hypotension. She was intubed, and subseuqnetly was found on a BAL PCP (pneumocystis jirovecii/carinii). She was ultimately transitioned to Bactrim DS for a total 21 day course after which she will need PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1088**]. .

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 20673**] is a 61 year old man with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, ?DM, atrial fibrillation (on coumadin), atrial thrombus who presented to his PCP's office today with bradycardia and hypotension.  He reports feeling generally fatigued and reports intermittent chest tightness x2 days. During the previous 2 days, he also endorses decreased PO intake.  He specifically denied chest reflux symptoms, arm pain, jaw pain, or diaphoresis. Of note, he had been recently admitted and discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] ([**Date range (3) 20674**]) for r/o MI with a diagnosis of GERD after a negative P-MIBI with EF 51% and negative serial cardiac enzymes.  On this admission, his digoxin was discontinued and his atenolol was changed to lopressor. . On presentation to ED, VS: T 97.9, HR 30, BP 70s/50s, RR 17, O2 sat 95%.  Workup in ED was significant for atrial fibrillation with HR in 30s and hypotension (SBP 80).  ST elevations were present in II, II, and avF with reciprocal depressions in V4-V6. A code STEMI was called.  The patient was administered ASA 325 mg daily, plavix 600 mg daily, glucagon, Zofran, and atropine 0.5 mg for a HR in 40s.  The patient was also ?initially bolused with heparin (5000 units IV) and integrilin (20 mg) in the ED; however, these medications were subsequently discontinued prior to cath as INR was elevated. He was sent to the cardiac catheterization lab for emergent PCI.  Of note, the patient was restrained during procedure because kept touching his groin. Cath showed a total occlusion of the mid RCA with thrombus, which was stented with 3 bare metal stents. .

46 year old man with advanced AIDS with CD4 count of 1 and viral load of 30,000 on HARRT (Darunavir/Etravirine/Truvada and Raltegravir) through a clinical trial who presented to OSH with shortness of breath, chest pain, and fever. Patient reports that 2 days PTA, he began having chest pain that he describes as a very heavy person sitting on his chest, it did not radiate, was worse when he leaned forward or took a deep breath, better when laying back and was accompanied by mild SOB. He took ASA and Celebrex (that a friend gave him) and the pain got better. His pain worsened w/ fevers to the low 101 one day PTA.  He initially went to [**Hospital 8534**] Hospital. He was found to have a mild elevation of troponins, negative d-dimer. His EKG showed PR depression in the inferior leads. An echo which revealed pericardial effusion. He has no history of coronary artery disease and was diagnosed with "pericarditits".  He continued to have symptoms and his TTE showed rapidly increasing pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.  He was taken to OR emergently by C-[**Doctor First Name **] on [**3149-8-26**] for pericardial window placement.  Patient states that his breathing improved markedly post procedure.  However overnight he was found to be hypoxic with new oxygen requirement (c/t post window status) to 4LNC. He continued to spike temp to 102 and his HR also increased from 110s to 140s, sinus tachycardia.  His UOP decreased overnight and recieved 40 IV lasix at midnight and has put out >2.5 L to that.  He recieved another 40 IV lasix early this morning. His pleuritic chest pain worsened however still markedly better than his admission pain.  Patient was transfered to CCU for further management of his care. . He denies any palpitations, worsening shortness of breath, nausea, vomitting, diaphoresis, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, headache, neck stiffness, lower extremity swelling.  Review of systems is otherwise negative. 
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with h/o CAD, CHF (EF of 25-30% per report in [**3120**]), who presents with a 2 week history of worsening lower extremity edema.  Per the patient and his nephew, the patient was in his normal state of health until approximately 1 month ago.  At this time, the patient developed progressive lower extremity edema, DOE, and fatigue, and presented to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 614**] on [**9-8**].  While there, the patient was diuresed with 40 mg IV Lasix [**Hospital1 **] and discharged to home with physical therapy.  Two weeks later, the patient again presented to OSH with a similar presentation and was again diuresed and returned home.  Since this time, the patient states that his legs have been increasing in size, he has had DOE, and he overall feels extremely fatigued.  The patient states that he is taking 60 mg of Lasix twice daily, and he has been faithful in taking this medication.  The patient also denies dietary indiscretion, but does admit to eating quite a lot of soup at home. . In the ED, the patient's VS were T 97.0, P 63, BP 135/80, R 20, O2 99% on RA.  The patient received 40 mg IV Lasix and diuresed well.  Cardiac enzymes were drawn, which were within his normal range.  CXR was performed which showed a LLL effusion.  The patient was then admitted to CC7 for further workup and evaluation. . On review of systems, the patient denies he denies any prior history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis.  He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain, chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. All of the other review of systems were negative. He endorses a prior stroke, GI Bleed. . . . ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with h/o CAD, CHF (EF 20%), and multiple admissions recently for lower extremity edema, who presents with a 2-week history of lower extremity edema. . #. Congestive Heart Failure:  The patient has a h/o CHF, with an EF of 20%.  The patient has had multiple admissions over the past month for lower extremity edema.  He is currently taking 60 mg PO Lasix [**Hospital1 **], and he states that he has been faithful with this regimen.  He does, however, endorse dietary indiscretion, which may in fact be unawareness of what a low-sodium diet entails.  On physical exam, the patient has 4+ pitting edema up to his hips bilaterally, scrotal edema, and elevated JVP.  The patient is most likely having a CHF exacerbation secondary to likely dietary indiscretion v. worsening cardiac function s/p MI v. medication non-compliance. - Lasix 60 mg IV now - Continue to measure accurate I/O q4h - Low-sodium diet with 1200 cc fluid restriction - Nutrition C/S for dietary education - TEDs in order to optimize preload. - Consider TTE in am in order to assess for further cardiac dysfunction. . #. Acute Renal Failure:  Patient presented with Cr of 1.8, which is elevated from his baseline of 1.5.  The patient is still making urine, and he diuresed well to 40 mg IV Lasix.  On his last admission at [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 614**], the patient's Cr increased in the setting of diuresis.  It appears that patient's acute on chronic renal failure is most likely a pre-renal etiology in the setting of CHF and poor forward flow v. obstruction v. ATN/AIN. - Lasix 60 mg IV now and continue with plan for CHF as outlined above - Send urine Na, Cr, and Urea in light of diuretic use to calculate FeUrea - Continue to trend Cr and UOP . #. Coronary Artery Disease:  The patient has a h/o CAD.  He is not currently having any symptoms of chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes were elevated in the ED, though they appear to be at his baseline (0.10) and the patient does not have any significant ECG changes on admission.  The patient's troponins are most likely elevated in the setting of acute renal failure. - Continue to monitor patient clinically - Repeat ECG in the am 
Pt is [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with h/o chf, afib, and 5 cm AAA who presents with complaints of diffuse abd pain and melanotic bowel movements.  Pt had sudden onset of diffuse abd pain yesterday. This was accompanied by 2 episodes of dark bloody bowel movements.  Pain continued to worsen throughout the night and pt presented to OSH.  At OSH, pt found to be hypotensive with severe tenderness on exam.  Hct was 19.  Non contrast CT scan performed which was non-revealing.  NG tube placed at OSH with bilious output, now with bright red blood per Ng tube.  Pt transferred here for further management.  Pt recently discharged from hospital one week ago for right foot infection.  Pt does have a history of GI bleed and was admitted to [**Hospital1 1998**] 6 months ago for this.  No clear source was found at that time and bleed resolved on its own. 
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with PMHx sCHF (EF 35-40%), Afibr s/p PPM, CVA, and duodenal ulcer presented to OSH with sob/hypoxia. He had a recent admission for ARF and NSTEMI (trop on the way down). He was in 90s on 5L NC required NRB and AMS. CXR unimpressive. Labs showed positive dimer, ABG showed respiratory alkalosis concerning for PE as per OSH ED. Additionally, he has afib not on coumadin due to allergy, but on aspirin and plavix. Given levaquin at [**Location (un) 614**] for questionable UTI, but UA returned with no WBC and no bacteria. CT head at [**Location (un) **] was negative then heparinized for transfer. Currently unable to CT due to CRF. . In the ED, initial vs were: 96.1 60 119/71 24 100, O2 sat 70's off NRB. ABG: 7.44/27/141 Patient was transferred to MICU for inpending respiratory failure and possible hypotension. . On the floor, he appeared in mild distress but stable. Found to be sating well on 6 L NC without any additional need for O2 support. Reported that he used O2 at home 24/7. On further questioning, patient was on face mask without O2 supplied for a while in nursing home which led him to decrease in his sat. 
61 yo male with a PMH for Acid reflux, TIIDM, HTN, s/p nephrectomy following RCC diagnosis, ESRD with dialysis 3x/week, and s/p cadaveric kidney transplant after lone kidney became dialysis dependent and stopped functioning well, who comes in complaining of CP. He was last well 3 days PTA when lifting heavy trash right after lunch at work when he felt acute chest pain that was burning in nature in his sternum that radiated to his back. It was severe in nature and was relieved with rest after 30 minutes. He did feel some SOB with this episode and does not remember how long it lasted for. He had no pain the following day and then 1 day PTA the same pain returned while watching TV and after eating spicy food. This time the pain lasted for 30 minutes and was relieved by burping and drinking gingerale and milk. The pain retuned this morning without eating and  was again relieved by drinking milk. The pain this morning was not as severe as times before. Of note, he states that he does not experience any exercise chest pain and is on his feet and walking all day without problem.

Review of systems: unable to obtain 
57 yo male with afib, venous insufficiency, significant UGIB, who presents to Dr.[**Name (NI) 5381**] office today with c/o worsening dyspnea and increasing weight gain and edema. He denies orthopnea or PND. He was told to have a sleep study, but he has not had that. He states he has alot of medical problems, but none of them are to the point where it concerns him. He denies any back or neck pain. He's had venous insufficiency and ulcers associated with that for a while, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of vascular for that. In Dr.[**Name (NI) 5381**] clinic, an echo was performed which showed e/o right heart strain and ? cor pulmonale. He was referred to our ED for further eval. In ED, initial vitals were 61, 112/85, mid 80s on RA, and then increased to 95% on 4L. He was noted to have bilateral crackles and anasarca on exam. A CTA was performed which was negative for PE. The patient was then admitted for volume overload. He was not given lasix in the ED in case a cath was to be performed in the AM. ECG was afib without any ischemic changes. cardiac enzymes were not very remarkable. On floor, patient was comfortable. he denied chest pain or SOB. he confirmed above. On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. 
The patient is a 32-year-old woman with no significant past medical history, although with previous tobacco use and who is seven months postpartum, who presented to her outpatient clinic on [**3-11**] with dyspnea on exertion which has been progressive over five months, epigastric pain, and fatigue. The patient was sent for a chest x-ray as an outpatient which showed an enlarged, and she was sent to the Emergency Department at an outside hospital where an echocardiogram showed a dilated left ventricle, severe global hypokinesis, and an estimated ejection fraction of 15%, as well as 2+ mitral valve regurgitation. The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 186**] for further management and was initially admitted to the C-MED Service.  The patient was diuresed approximately 2 liters on the Medicine floor but was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit on [**3-12**] after becoming tachycardic, dizzy, with a weak pulse, and hypotensive (requiring a dopamine drip). Upon transfer to the Coronary Care Unit, the patient reported shortness of breath at rest as well as overall fatigue.  The patient denied chest pain or palpitations.  The patient also reported lightheadedness as well as visual blackouts which had resolved by the time she had arrived to the Coronary Care Unit. 
64F w/ PMH significant for DM2, CAD, HTN, CRI, CHF was in her usual state of health until 4 days prior to arrival when she developed a urinary tract infection and began to take ciprofloxacin [**Hospital1 **], prescribed by her PCP (of which she took 4 pills thus far). On the morning of admission, she developed an acute episode of nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, shortness of breath, light headedness, near syncope, pallor, and garbled speech for a few minutes.  No witnessed LOC/CP/palpitations/sz activity.  EMS found patient with heart rate in the 20s in complete sinus arrest (junctional escape beat), SBP 60/palpable with no response to IV atropine, so she was transcutanteously paced.  There were peaked Ts on EKG in field with K=7.3 in our ED.  She was given CaCl/Bicarb/D50/insulin/kayexalate with good response of K falling to 5.4 and sinus node recovered without the help of an intravenous pacer.  SBP remained 70s-90s, so dopamine was started.  Other initial labs were notable for Hct 19 (bl 30), Na 134, Cr 3.3 (bl 2.5), glucose 324, lactate 3.2, troponin 0.12, and negative toxicology screen. 
Pt. is a 70 y/o F with insulin dependent DM, h/o IMI '[**73**] s/p PTCA and stent, pernicious anemia, MVR (porcine valve) in [**3375**], recently disagnosed pulmonary HTN, who presented to the ED today with bilateral LE pain and swelling and DOE.  Pt. reports she has diffuse pain in both legs from her feet to her hips, which has been present x 1 year, getting worse recently.  Also reports DOE that is worse when she bends over and exerts herself, which has gotten worse in the last month, although son reports some improvement in symptoms with Viagra, which was started several weeks ago after she was diagnosed with pulm. HTN. . Per our records pt had a R tibial plateau fracture 1 year ago, c/b erosion of lateral condyle by hardwear s/p hardware removal by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21726**] in [**1-28**], and s/p several episodes of "knee infection" per pt.  Pt. denies pain centered around knee at present.  Pt. reports she was recently admitted at [**Hospital 616**] Medical Center for similar complaints.  Per conversation with pt's son it seems she had a R heart catheterization there and was diagnosed with pulmonary HTN, and a pleural effusion was tapped.  There was some concern for PE per pt's son, he thinks that this was eventually ruled out but is not sure how. . In [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to be 88%RA, 94% 4L NC with CXR with bilateral pleural effusions and pulm vasc redistribution consistent with CHF.  Was given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1, morphine 2 mg IV x 2, Ativan 1 mg IV x 2, ASA 81 mg PO x 1, and Kayexylate 30 mg PO x 1 at 2 am for K of 6.0. . K on recheck was 5.8, had not stooled -> given 30 mg more Kayexelate, Ca gluconate. 
The patient is a 70 year old woman who is status post re-do mitral valve replacement with a #29 pericardial valve and tricuspid valve repair with a #34 annuloplasty band who had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharge to [**Hospital3 1740**] Hospital on postoperative day 6.  Since being admitted to rehab, she has gained 20 pounds of fluid, developed worsening lower extremity ulcers, had elevated blood sugars which have been in the 400 and 500 range, and has been disgruntled with the level of care provided, therefore, signing out AMA from the rehabilitation center. She presented to the wound clinic at [**Hospital1 18**] for follow up following which she was admitted. 
The patient states that for the past 3 days she has been feeling weak. She has been unable to ambulate. Her PO intake has been poor. She states that she has decreased urine output for the past couple of days. Also complains of pain in her throat which started yesterday. . In the ED, initial vs were: T 96.8 HR 68 BP 152/90 RR 18 SpO2 96% RA. Initial labs were notable for a K of 7.2, as well as a positive UA. The patient was given insulin and D50, kayexalate, 3 amps of bicarb in D5W. EKG showed peaked T-waves. Otherwise the patient was treated for positive UA with ceftriaxone. Renal was consulted to see patient and determined that patient would benefit from dialysis. Prior to coming to the floor received calcium to stabilize cardiac membrane. . On the floor, the patient arrived with HR 66 BP 160/66 RR 18 SpO2 96% on RA.  Repeat labs on arrival to the floor initially showed a K of 6.9 but on chem 10 was 5.9, repeat green top was 5.8.  Since her K was improving, it was decided not to pursue HD for her hyperkalemia.  She currently feels well with no complaints. . Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

84 y.o woman with history of CAD s/p CABG, cardiomyopathy with EF of 30%, left ventricular aneurysm, vtach and Vfib s/p ICD placement in [**2535**] who presented initially to the ED with a complaint of urinary retention but was then found to be in ventricular tachycardia.  The patient initially described symptoms of 2 weeks of dysuria, suprapubic tenderness and urinary retention consistent with a UTI.  However during her workup, she developed palpitations and was triggered for a heart rate in 140s-150s. . The patient's EKG demonstrated a narrow complex ventricular tachycardia with a left axis, at a rate of 132bpm.  She maintained her pressure initially, however at one point developed mild hypotension with BP of 87/62 for which she was given a 500cc NS bolus.  She was initially treated with metoprolol 10mg IV, and cardiology was consulted.  On interrogation of the ICD, the patient has had since her prior admission multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia that had been terminated by anti-tachycardia pacing.  Her native rhythm currently is sequential A-V pacing.  She was subsequently loaded with 50mg of lidocaine and started on a drip of 1mg/min, and her rhythm self terminated.  She was noted to be mentating throughout this episode.  The patient does report that she has had episodes in the past similar to this that generally terminate within several minutes, however none as severe as this one today.  She also reported some nausea associated with the episode, but no chest pain. . Other events in the ED included a workup for her UTI/suprapubic tenderness.  Her urinalysis was negative, however a CT of the [**Last Name (un) 102**]/pelvis demonstrated an infra-renal aortic clot of undetermined age for which vascular surgery was consulted. Blood cultures were drawn and she was started on levofloxacin and flagyl empirically.  Prior to transfer, she was in her native rhythm with vitals of HR 76 BP 117/69 RR 18 Saturation 98% on 2L, afebrile. . Review of systems was negative for fevers, chills, vomiting, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, dizziness or lightheadedness. . 
71 y/o female with h/o Aortic Stenosis now with worsening dyspnea on exertion and chest tightness. Most recent echo revealed severe aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and dilated ascending aorta. She was referred for surgical intervention. 
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, and an aortic aneurysm status post endovascular repair in [**3312-2-16**], who presents with left groin swelling. The patient had been in his usual state of health until two weeks prior to admission when he complained of this left groin swelling.  He denied any fever or chills, nausea or vomiting, or any other complaints.  Patient presented to [**Hospital3 15319**] Hospital, where the left groin swelling, where the abscess was was spontaneously drained.  He was then transferred to the Emergency Room at [**Hospital1 188**], where he was started empirically on Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and clindamycin for probable groin abscess.  He is also treated for his hyperkalemia as his potassium on admission was 6.2.  He was also transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells for his hematocrit of 25 and fluid resuscitated. 
The patient was hospitalized on [**3312-2-12**] to [**3312-2-15**] for bilateral fluid collections on the right was 12 X 8 and on the left was 12 X 7; seroma versus hematoma was the thinking.  The patient developed low back pain with radiation to the groin. The patient went to an outside hospital and then was referred to us.  He underwent a noncontrast computed tomography which revealed a right groin fluid collection which was stable. Infectious Disease felt at that time there was no clinical or radiological evidence of abscess worsening.  Their recommendations were that the patient complete an 8-week course of vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl.  At the time of admission, he had two more weeks of antibiotics.  The hospital course was unremarkable except for a low hematocrit of 26.1 for which he was transfused.  The patient's hematocrit was 34.1. The patient returns now with two weeks of left groin swelling.  He did not seek medical attention.  He denied constitutional symptoms.  The pain continued to progress until [**3313-3-8**] when the patient sought medical attention and was seen at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital and admitted. The groin spontaneously drained.  A computed tomography was done there.  Report of the findings were not available to us. The patient was transferred to our institution for further evaluation and treatment.

History obtained from ER physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] nursing staff at [**Location (un) 21795**] on the [**Doctor Last Name **] as patient unable to provide history. Per report, this is a 78F with PMH of DMII, COPD on 2L home O2, HTN, depression and anxiety presenting with altered mental status and suicidal ideation. Per nursing staff patient has been progressively more confused over the past two months, with particular worsening over the past two weeks. Patient is re-directable, but oriented only to self and has periods of confusion where she believes her husband is still alive. On the day of admission she became acutely agitated, throwing herself on the ground and stating that she was going to jump out the window or hang herself because she was being kept against her will. At that time she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]. Nursing staff denies recent fevers or change in respiratory status; by report, urinalysis and CXR were negative for infection over the past week. ROS: Unable to be obtained as patient refuses to answer questions. Pertinent positives as noted above. 
79 year old male with untreated aplastic anemia is being admitted for ATG + cyclosporine treatment. Pt was found to have a hematopoietic disorder in [**4-23**] when he went to his PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] follow up after experiencing lethargy. Patient's marrow was initially aplastic on [**3147-7-3**]. Since then, he has been tried on IVIG and prednisone without significant effect. His medical course has been complicated by line infection, perianal abscess, retinal bleed and the findings of pulmonary nodules and granulomatous disease. Hence, at this time he is finishing a 9 month course of INH. His CT Chest shows improved nodules allowing him to undergo ATG + Cyclosporine at this time. At home, he denies any fevers, chest pain, SOB or bodily pain. Denies any rashes, bleeding. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction, chronic renal insufficiency who presented to [**Hospital6 1739**] on [**3279-4-10**] for catheterization for management of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.  He presented from an outside hospital.  He initially presented to an outside hospital in St. [**Doctor Last Name **] while on vacation with a left hip fracture.  While at this outside hospital he flashed, having pulmonary edema requiring intubation times one day.  There he ruled in for myocardial infarction with a positive troponin.  He denied chest pain, palpitations and loss of consciousness, only positive for shortness of breath.  He presented to [**Hospital Unit Name 194**] on [**3279-4-10**] and was catheterized on [**3279-4-12**].  Right atrium 12, mean right ventricle 55/14, pulmonary airway 55/25, wedge 27, mid right coronary artery discrete 80%, distal right coronary artery discrete 80%, both of these lesions had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent.  Left main diffusely diseased 70%, mid left anterior descending discrete 100%, collateral from an right posterior descending artery.

The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old white male with a history of coronary artery disease with three-vessel disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure with recent acute renal failure admitted to outside hospital on [**3279-6-1**] with hypoxia.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management of respiratory failure.  In the early even of [**3279-6-1**] at rehabilitation the patient complained of shortness of breath. Oxygen saturations decreased to the 60s.  He was sent to an outside hospital where he reportedly became unresponsive with oxygen saturations of 80% on 100% face mask.  He was intubated and sent to the intensive care unit.  He was treated for presumed aspiration pneumonia with Levaquin and started on vancomycin for one out of two blood cultures positive for "staph".  No further isolation was noted.  White blood cell count was 15.9.  There was no documented fever. The patient was diuresed with Lasix 80 mg IV b.i.d. with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of approximately 15.  He was placed on a dopamine drip for hypotension with systolic pressures in the 70s.  On the morning of transfer the patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 160s to 170s.  He was started on a diltiazem drip in addition to the dopamine pressor for rate control as well as a heparin drip. The wife requested transfer to [**Hospital1 186**] where he was recently hospitalized [**3279-4-10**] through [**3279-4-22**] for left hip fracture, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, stent to the right coronary artery, acute renal failure secondary to contrast dye requiring dialysis x 2, and repair of hip fracture with a left open reduction and internal fixation.  Upon transfer he was on SIMV 16-[**PT ID Number 21815**], heparin drip, dopamine drip, diltiazem drip and insulin drip.  Of note, in addition to his respiratory failure he was in diabetic ketoacidosis with a metabolic acidosis.  He had blood loss anemia with an hematocrit of 19 and he was in shock with a picture most consistent with sepsis. 
[**Age over 90 **]yoF NH resident with h/o CHF (EF 35%), s/p CVA (L hemiparesis), HTN, PVD, recent SBE (staph hominis), dementia presents from [**Hospital1 5521**] today with increasing lethargy, decreased responsiveness, fever 100.6 and new onset rapid Afib/flutter. Pt was given digoxin 0.5mg for loading dose, started on D51/2NS. Pt also noted to have FSBG in 800s with no prior hx of diabetes. Sent in to [**Hospital1 18**] for further mngmt. In [**Name (NI) **], pt noted to have temp 101.8, Na 156, glucose 734, Cr 1.5, lactate of 6.3, WBC 20.1 (L shift), UA with signs of UTI. Given ceftaz x1 in ED, started on insulin gtt and given 1L NS with 40meq KCl. Head CT and CXR neg. Sent to [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for further care. Goals d/w family and on-call geriatrics fellow. No invasive procedures, DNR/DNI. In the [**Name (NI) 152**] pt was on insulin gtt for >24h (stopped [**6-19**] around 10am).  Changed to SSI, with which she has had occasional hypoglycemic episodes.  Transitioning now to oral hypoglycemics with SSI coverage.  Hypernatremia was corrected with appropriate hydration.  Electrolytes monitored and repleted.  Sodium on [**6-20**] afternoon 143, so D5W stopped and now just on PO fluids.  Afib has been treated with digoxin and metoprolol.  No anticoagulation so far given uncertain fall risk. Likely UTI being treated with ceftriaxone (7 day course) and also on vanco for possibility of SBE.  Pt now back to her presumed baseline in terms of mental status. 
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMH significant for CHF, HTN, dementia, and s/p CVA admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**12-17**] with fevers and hypoxia. Pt was apparently in her normal state of health until [**12-17**] when she was noted at [**Hospital1 99**] Senior Life to be lethargic with a fever of 101, tachypnia, and hyperglycemia with a BS of over 400. Pt was given a dose of tylenol, started on oxygen via nasal cannula, and transferred to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. In the ED, the pt's VS were >104.8  132  114/70 --> 94/palp  30 96% 3L NC. The pt received zosyn, vancomycin, and flagyl. She was started on the sepsis protocol and levophed was required to support her BP in addition to 3 L of NS. Pt was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for further care. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**], the pt was noted to be lethargic and unable to answer any questions on arrival. At that time, her temperature had decreased to 97.5  but she was on a NRB with an oxygen saturation of 100%. Significantly, her WBC count was 30.4 with 11% bands. The pt's antibiotics were adjusted to vancomycin, flagyl, and ceftiraxone. She was also started on an insulin drip to optamize glucose control. In further diagnostic workup, pt was found to have a positive UA with concern for urosepsis. This was confirmed when urine and blood cultures from [**12-17**] became positive for Proteous mirabilis. She was started on zosyn to cover her infection. In addition, there was a concern for C diff so the pt was started on PO vancomycin. Pt was weaned of off the levophed on [**12-18**] and overnight went into rapid atrial fib requiring a diltiazem drip for control. The dilt drip was able to be weaned off on [**12-19**] and she was restarted on her PO beta blocker. In further events, pt had episodes of hyoglycemia on [**12-19**] for which she was started on D5 drip but this has now been weaned off and the pt is maintaining stable blood sugars. She will be transferred to the floor for further care at this time. 
This 78 year old male with history of a.flutter, AS, COPD, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy stopped taking his medications one week ago and presents today with SOB, LE swelling, ataxia.  He also has decreased exercise tolerance, increased DOE, PND, anorexia.  He has had documented heart rates in the 130-140s for the last 9 months.  He was scheduled for cardiac catheterization to evaluate coronary arteries and aortic valve next monday with possible a.flutter ablation and possible AVR.  At baseline he can climb about 15 steps before becoming SOB.  No chest pain or syncope. On arrival to ED heart rate was 170 and BP 94/79 goat 20mg Dilt IV, 540 mg XR, azithro and CTX, BP dropped to 80/70s and HR dropped to 130s in regular a.flutter. 
71F PMH DM, HTN, hyperchol, CRI, presented to the ED c/o SOB, congestion, and pleuritic chest "pressure," since Sunday.  No chest pain. She had apparently had a viral-like infection on Sunday, with URI symptoms, vomiting, and diarrhea, with resolution of the GI symptoms but persistence of the congestion. She appeared short of breath when she saw her nephrologist today, and was sent to the ED. When seen in the ED, she was chest pain free and blood pressure was 150/77. Sats were 92-94% on RA.  D-dimer was 1017, and given concern for PE she was sent for VQ scan.  While returning she became diaphoretic and was noted to have SBP 270/140. EKG revealed ST elevations in anterior precordial leads. Trop/CK/MB was 0.10/112/3 initially, and repeat values were 0.8/102/pending.  She was given NTG SL x3, and started on a nitro gtt. She was started on NRB, with sats in high 90s with crackles on lung exam and JVP 8 cm, and given lasix to which she put out 2+L of urine.  Echo performed showed no RV strain, and symmetric wall hypertrophy without focal motion abnormalities. Also notable on admission was a Hct of 25 (pt has history of anemia (Fe def and CRI) with baseline Hct 26 - 28), and a Cr of 2.5 (baseline 1.7 - 2.0). Pt was then admitted to CCU for hypertensive emergency given SBP 260s and ST elev V2-V4. 
81 yo M w/ hx of CAD (3 VD s/p multiple PCAs [see below] most recent w/ POBA to mid-RCA [**11-25**]), ischemic CM (systolic and diastolic, last EF 40% 2/10), Parkinsons Dz, DM2, HTN, Renal cell carcinoma (s/p L nephrectomy), TIA who presented from rehabilitation facility with 2 days low grade fever, deoxygenation and SOB. . Pt. was in USOH (deconditioned, fatigued, requiring 2L NC since arriving at [**Hospital **] rehab, see recent d/c summary [**2635-8-27**]) until 3 days PTA when he developed low grade fevers (99-100F), with worsening fatigue and cough productive of white sputum.  He reported substernal dull CP w/o radiation or diaphoresis/nausea, but did not recall duration.  His sx improved for one day, however, on day of admission in AM, he was noted to have worsening cough, increased RR and hypoxia to 86% on 2LNC.  Due to this change he was sent to the ED for an evaluation. In the ED, initial vs were: T99 P80 BP150/72 R20 99% O2 sat on 4LNC. He was noted to require increasing oxygen to NRB, satting in high 90s.  He was given ASA 325mg, Vancomycin 1g and CFTX 1g. Due to no improvement, further lab tests were obtained and were notable for BNP of ~ 30K (prior at 18K), troponin of 0.2 w/o CK elevation, a dirty UA and Na of 149. EKG was reported as unchanged from prior. His BP max was at 149, so he was started on nitro gtt, given 40mg IV lasix (300cc UOP). and transferred to the floor. .

68 y/o female w/ h/o HTN, ^Chol, DM, CHF w/ cc of SOB and recent +ETT. Referred for cardiac cath which revealed 2 vessel disease. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 22136**] is a 78-year-old gentleman with HTN, DM2, CAD s/p MIx2, 3 vessel CABG in [**2751**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-D1, SVG-OM1, SVG-PDA), cath in [**3-/2773**] with stent to LAD, AFib on coumadin, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 30%, NSVT with Pacer/ICD transferred from OSH with fevers, hypotension.  The patient was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-25**] after ventricular ablation for VT. . His most recent ICD firing was in [**2772-4-16**] which was felt to have been induced by exercising on a stationary bicycle.  As a result, he underwent cardiac catheterization and received a stent to his LAD.  Since his discharge in [**Month (only) 115**], he has had further chest discomfort and reevaluation of his coronary arteries via cardiac catheterization on [**2773-7-24**] which showed a patent LAD stent and no change in his coronary anatomy.  In [**Month (only) 213**], he was hospitalized in [**Location (un) 22137**] after he developed acute onset chest discomfort and was admitted to an emergency room with wide complex tachycardia at a rate of 130 beats per minute.  His ICD did not fire as it was programmed for faster rates.  Reportedly his arrhythmia self-terminated and the question of atrial fibrillation with aberrency versus VT. Patient was apparently stable as the arrhythmia lasted for an hour and he never had syncope. . The patient was seen on [**9-5**] at EP clinic where heart histograms suggested reasonable rate control of his atrial fibrillation with his average heart rate 70-80 beats per minute. Additionally, there is no significant amount of ventricular high rates greater than 110 beats per minute which suggest that this arrhythmia which occurred in [**Location (un) 22137**] was likely to be ventricular tachycardia.  He seems to tolerate the WCT hemodynamicaly (no syncope), but has significant chest pain with it.  The patient was seen here on [**2773-9-25**] for an EP study that resulted in 5 ablations of the 14 discovered foci.  The remaining foci was resistant to sustained Vtach by induction. The patient was discharged on [**2773-9-26**].  He complained of dysuria after discharge presumably from a traumatic foley tap in the EP lab.  While on the ferry to [**Hospital1 6606**] he developed acute shortness of breath, chills, rigors and AMS.  He was immediately brought to the [**Hospital3 **] with a temperature of 103.7F sating 100% on 15L NRB with a RR in the 30s and BP of 107/60 with a HR of 77.  His WBC was 3, BUN was 38 and Cr and 2.1. Anesthesia attempted to intubate him, but failed.  He was given 80mg IV lasix, 0.25mg IV digoxin and 100mg IV lidocaine for multiple PVCs.  [**Location (un) 7532**] arrived and successfully intubated the patient for transport, but the patient became acutely hypotensive and was started on a dopamine and levophed drip and was 3L net positive.

Reports that over the last four weeks, he has experienced 4 electric like shocks located in his chest, that he attributes to his ICD firing. Reports that he may have had palpitations prior to his shocks. These events occurred when he was sitting at rest. Denies any lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, shortness of breath, chest pressure, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. . Admitted to EP/[**Hospital1 1498**] service for VT ablation today ([**9-16**]). Prior to procedure patient went into recurrent VT leading to multiple ICD shocks. He was loaded with intravenous lidocaine with partial success. The VT was monomorphic and he was stable hemodynamically. He was taken to EP for repeat ablation while in VT. During the procedure patient required neosinephrine and dopamine to support his blood pressure. Patient was admitted to the CCU for monitoring overnight. . Of note, patient underwent VT ablation in [**9-21**] with ablation of 5 areas. Patient did well afterwards on amiodarone until he developed mixed restrictive and obstructive pattern with decreased DlCO. .

Patient's caregiver stated that he has had increased secretions over the past week, as well as increased confusion and pulling off of his BiPap mask. She also notes that this morning he was very fatigued, and couldn't get out of bed for breakfast. He had no fevers or chills at home. There were no other localizing signs, symptoms, no dysuria or diarrhea. At baseline, he is able to walk with assistance, and is alert and oriented x3. He is able to eat and bath and groom himself. In the ED his vitals were temp 101.9 88 162/97 16 96% RA. He was found to have LLL infiltrate on CXR. Fever but no WBC. His symptoms were felt c/w CAP. He was started on levaquin and clinda and admitted to medicine. 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 4820**] is a 61 year old woman with hx of ulcerative colitis/Crohns, recent DVT, who presented with chest discomfort initially, found to have pericardial effusion increasing in size, who was transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for overnight monitoring s/p placement of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade. Patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] with pneumonia, for which she was treated with Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin. Patient was noted to have small pericardial effusion at that time with a pulsus paradoxus of <10mmHg, felt to be stable. She was also diuresed for volume overload, and her TPN volume was decreased. She was discharged on [**2-9**]. Patient returned to hospital on this admission because of temperature to 100.1F and was found to have pericardial effusion markedly incrased in size. On presentation to floor, patient did complain of tugging sensation in her chest, muscle aches and dry cough and reported having had these symptoms on discharge from previous hospitalization. She does report diarrhea but unchanged from her normal diarrhea associated with her IBD. She was ruled out for influenza on the floor. She denied chills, sore throat, runny nose, headache, abdominal pain or SOB. She denied hematochezia or melena. She admitted to intermittent swelling of her legs for past two years, which she attributed to her gout initially. Echocardiogram this morning was similar to previous Echo yesterday, showing large free-flowing pericardial effusion with RV invagination and diastolic collaps, evidence of cardiac tamponade. Patient was taken to Cath lab for placement of pericardial drain. Right Heart Cath showed equalization of pressures in RA, PCWP, and Pericardial Pressure at 20mmHg, suggesting tamponade physiology. 450cc serosanguinous fluid drained from pericardiocentesis, fluid sent for studies, drain left in place, and patient transferred to CCU for further monitoring. On transfer to CCU, she appears to be comfortable and stable. No complaints of chest discomfort, just has mild lower back pain from positioning in bed. 
The patient is a 71 year old male with a history of diabetes Type 2, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation who presented with a two week history of increasing progressive shortness of breath.  He was in his usual state of health prior to two weeks ago and he could perform all of his activities of daily living without dyspnea on exertion.  Shortness of breath with walking several steps or stairs has developed over the last two weeks.  Furthermore there was increase in lower extremity swelling after two days.  Review of systems was also positive for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea as well as orthopnea.  The patient states he has never had these symptoms before.  He denies chest pain.  There is also an increase in scrotal swelling as well as abdominal girth associated with his decrease in his appetite.  He is not complaining of fever, chills, cough, bright red blood per rectum, melena, dysuria, frequency, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. 
73 yo male with a history of diabetes, end stage renal failure, and congestive heart failure presents to the emeergency department with evidence of septic shock following a recent fall. Pt has been confused, acutely hypotensive (80/50).  The patient has had diarrhea and dizziness for the last 2 days and fell while trying to go to the bathroom.  A family member noted that he struck his head and flank on falling. 
This 64-year-old gentleman has a significant past medical history of esophageal carcinoma with resection, neoesophagus reconstruction, radiation and chemotherapy approximately ten years ago.  He was seen in cardiology follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1886**] on [**2822-9-7**] for continued complaints of dyspnea on exertion.  He reported dyspnea after walking one block or climbing one flight of stairs.  The patient previously underwent noninvasive evaluation including a nuclear stress test on [**2822-5-31**] where he achieved 83% of his age predicted maximum heart rate, developing dyspnea, with nuclear images demonstrating no abnormal myocardial perfusion defects.  He was not noted to have ischemic EKG changes either but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1886**] felt that due to the low-level work load the test was inconclusive.   He also underwent an echocardiogram on [**2822-8-24**] which graded his MR as mild-to-moderate which was again felt to be suboptimal due to the presence of neoesophagus which is reportedly not in close proximity to the left atrium as is the norm. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1886**] reports a moderate degree of improvement in this gentleman's symptoms after initiation of an ACE inhibitor and diuretic.  He has thus referred Mr. [**Known patient lastname 22323**] for a right and left heart catheterization along with ergometry to assess his level of mitral regurgitation, any ischemic component of the symptoms and also to rule out any cardiomyopathy that may have been caused by his history of chest radiation. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 22323**] is a 64 year-old man with a history of esophageal cancer, s/p resection, neoesophagus, radiation, and chemotherapy who presents with GIB. . Most recently admitted [**Date range (1) 22325**] with dyspnea and suboptimal stress test.  Cardiac catheterization revealed moderate MR and two vessel CAD.  He underwent a pericardectomy  only as he had severe constrictive pericarditis related to his esophageal radiation. . Reports feeling well until evening prior to admission when he began to vomit blood.  No nausea or vomiting before initial hemetemesis.  Over the evening he vomited ~5 times, once with "jellyfish" appearance.  Also with concurrent black stools (~5). Last episode of hemetemesis was at 7am on day of admission. . Initially presented to an OSH where BP was 109/68 with HR 129. HCT found to ve 22.1.  2 units of pRBC were given. . In the ED, initial BP 116/79 with HR 120, RR 20 and 100% on room air.  BP fell to as low as 95/70 with HR in the 120s.  Recieved 1+ liters of IVF. . ROS: (+) weight loss of 22lbs since [**10-8**]; thinks this is water weight (+) fatigue (-) fevers/chills (-) Chest pain (+) SOB with exertion (noted since before [**10-8**]) (-) nausea/abdominal pain (-) dysphagia/odynophagia Denies use of NSAIDs or other OTC meds 
Pt is a 73yo F w/ PMH of HTN, ESRD on HD, diastolic dysfunction, who presented to the ED with increased BLE edema. Her LE have been getting more and more edematous, to the point where she is unable to wear her shoes. She is now on rehab with the purpose of getting her functional enough to undergo a R TKR (per the patient). At rehab, she has been limited due to her LE edema. Her R knee has been more painful and more swollen over last month. No h/o trauma or falls. She denies any recent fevers or chills and has not had swelling this bad in her knees in the past. They have been trying to run her dry at HD, but the swelling persists. Denies any recent CP, SOB. + palpitations. Sleeps on 3 pillows behind her head and 2 underneath her feet, which is stable. Mild DOE - has 15 stairs to climb at her house, sometimes has to sit between flights. No n/v recently. Still w/ profuse diarrhea. Swelling in LE as noted above. . Pt was recently admitted [**5-28**] - [**6-8**] with diagnosis of AF with RVR, abd pain and distention, as well as an elevated INR. Briefly, she was rate controlled with IV and PO medicines, had a paracentesis for ascites felt to be due to CHF induced hepatic congestion, and then ultimately found to have C diff for which she was treated with PO vanco/flagyl. There was a question of mesenteric ischemia vs. IBD as well, given that she frequently had bloody stools. It was recommended to undergo a colonoscopy as an outpatient for further evaluation. She continues on PO vanco, to finish her course on [**6-22**]. . In the ED, VS showed T 98.4, BP 120/60, HR 75, RR 20, sats 99% on RA. Arthrocentesis was performed on her R knee. She was given morphine for pain relief. CXR was performed. Labs revealed a BNP of 54K. She was admitted to medicine for management of her CHF. 
This is a 72 year old gentleman with known coronary artery disease, ischemic/alcoholic cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, admitted to outside hospital with chest pain and shortness of breath; transferred to [**Hospital1 1426**] for catheterization. The patient admitted to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital on [**3312-3-7**], with respiratory failure and severe congestive heart failure; had presented with three days of chest pain and shortness of breath.  The patient intubated and aggressively diuresed. Extubated on [**3312-3-8**].  CKs were flat at 25, 29 and 32, however, troponin elevated at 1.4, 1.3 and 0.8, and MB percentage elevated at 9.6, 12.1 and 9.4.  The patient on transfer continued to have on and off chest pain, which was one out of ten on transfer despite intravenous Nitroglycerin, intravenous Heparin and a Morphine and gastrointestinal cocktail.  The patient describes his chest pain over the past one week as nonradiating and associated with shortness of breath, diaphoresis and alleviated with Nitroglycerin and MDIs. The patient was noted by the outside hospital to have some "rapid rhythm" while he was intubated and there was some question of atrial fibrillation. The patient has had a decreased hematocrit of 27 to 30 at the outside hospital and is guaiac positive on [**3312-3-8**].  The patient has apparently had a gastrointestinal workup in the past which was supposedly negative from below (question of a flexible sigmoidoscopy versus colonoscopy in the past), and was due to have an esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The patient had a Persantine Cardiolite on [**3312-2-17**], at the outside hospital.  No angina noted.  Electrocardiogram was uninterpretable secondary to ventricular pacing, and a large inferoapical and small anteroseptal defects with some reperfusion were noted. The patient had an echocardiogram in 12/00, at [**Hospital1 341**] demonstrating a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, akinetic apex, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, severely dilated left ventricle, and moderately dilated left atrium and right atrium.  Mild aortic insufficiency and moderate mitral regurgitation were also noted at that time. The patient also had an ETT Thallium in 12/00, which noted a fixed apical perfusion defect and moderate fixed inferior wall perfusion defect. 
57yo male with hx of HCV (no documented cirrhosis), HIV (CD4 count of 9; viral load of >100,000), CAD (s/p MI '[**67**] and cath), CHF (EF <30%) who presents with acute new onset increased abdominal distension.  Pt reports 5 days of progressively increasing abdominal girth.  Initially, the patient attributed this to constipation, however the abdominal disstension progressed even after multiple large BMs.  Pt reports associated SOB, progressive DOE over the last couple of days (previous could walk at least 1/8th of a mile but now SOB after 0.5 blocks), orthopnea (progressive 2 pillow requirement) and ?PND. Pt also reports he has felt "cloudy" with difficulty concentrating.  Pt also reports difficulty sleeping, however this has not changed and the pt attributes this to his baseline mania/psych disorder.  The patient has not noticed a tremor.  Pt denies abdominal pain, fever, chills, rigors, n/v/d.  Pt also denies CP, palpitations, light headedness, dizziness, cough, sputum production. . ROS: Pt does report a "few drops" of blood followed a BM last week.  This was an isolated episode that resolved on own without intervention.  Pt currently denies, BRBPR, black tarry stools, stools with particular strong odors.  Pt reports [**4-2**] BM/day. Pt also reports some inc. thirst, without polyuria. . The patient received a therapeutic/diagnostic paracentesis in the ED.  850cc of fluid was removed. The fluid was sent for cell count and diff, as well as protein, glucose, and amylase. (Albumin was added on as was cytology later in the AM). 
75yo F with CAD s/p MI x4 (s/p LAD stent '[**32**] and RCA stentx2 in '[**34**] and '[**38**]), CHF with EF 55%, PAF, Inducible Vtach s/p AICD placement, sick sinus syndrome s/p pacer and COPD with restrictive lung disease.  Per daughter, pt was in her USOH until two days prior to admission when she was noted to have a superficial ulcerations on her foot with erythema.  Pt was taken to [**Location (un) 505**] [**Hospital 11316**] Hospital and started on unasyn IV.  Pt awoke later that night and felt unsteady on her feet and sustained a mechanical fall.  Per daughter, pt did not note chest pain, tachycardia, had a good PO intake and no noted seizure activity.  Pt was in severe "back pain" as per daughter which was treated with dilaudid.  CT of the neck revealed a possible C1 fracture and the X-ray at the OSH revealed intratrochanteric fracture of the right femur.  Pt was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for orthopaedic evaluation. In ED at [**Hospital1 18**], pt was seen by the Trauma service where a CT of the neck revealed no fracture (however, the c-collar was maintained secondary to pain).  The orthopaedic service recommended emergent repair of the intratrochanteric fracture secondary to instability.  The ED stay was complicated by runs of afib to 133 requiring IV lopressor. . ROS: Pt is very SOB at baseline, not on home ox, no CP at rest, no LE edema, no PND, stable orthopnea (2 pillows).  Pt ambulates 10 feet with significant fatigue as per daughter.  (?[**Month (only) **] in exercise tolerance).  Med change include discontinuation of coumadin secondary to inc risk of upper GI bleed.  Digoxin, Norvasc and Imdur was also discontinued. . HPI:  75 yoF with CAD s/p stenting, VT, SSS s/p pacer, COPD, presented to OSH [**3240-2-13**] with foot ulceration.  Started on unasyn, in hospital suffered mech. fall with hip fx. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2-14**].  Medically eval not high risk surgery, preop beta blocker given. . ORIF with repair of neck fracture [**3240-2-15**].  Expected prolonged extubation course given COPD history, as with colon CA resection surgery.  In PM extubated, transferred to floor [**3240-2-15**]. . Late [**2-15**] found with afib and RVR, given beta blocker with min. response, started dilt. drip.  Received 2 mg dilaudid for pain o/n. . This AM with respiratory failure, continued tachycardia on dilt. gtt.  Transferred to unit and urgently intubated (labs below.) . Of note, a NGT by Xray was not in correct position ?lungs -> possibly used for medication administration this AM. 
This is an 83 year old female with PMH of diastolic CHF, interstitial lung disease, HTN, and hyperlipidemia who presented with AMS, fever, and tachycardia after being found down on the floor near her bed by her nephew.  [**Name (NI) **] went to celebrate [**Holiday 1433**] with her family, and remembers being driven home. Her nephew stayed with her for a while after dropping her off because he thought she was a little out of breath.  After he left, the patient does not remember anything further.  She was found in her pajamas next to her bed.  The patient did not remember falling or passing out.  She woke up while on the floor, and wondered what she was doing there, but then fell back asleep.  Her nephew tried calling her, and when she didn't pick up, he went over to find her laying on the floor.  On presentation to the ED she was lethargic and A+Ox2. She arrived complaining of shortness of breath. She denied any chest pain, nausea, vomitting, or diarrhea. In the ED, her initial VS were T=101.2, HR=130, BP=124/84, RR=32, and O2 sats were not recorded. She triggered for AMS and tachycardia in the ED upon arrival. EKG showed an irregular tachycardia and was non-ischemic. Labs were significant for WBC of 14.4, lactate of 1.6. CXR showed no evidence of PNA. UA showed many bacteria but leukocyte esterase and nitrates were negative. Her head CT was negative. An LP was unremarkable for infection. Flu swab was sent, 1 gram of Tylenol was given for her fever, and the patient was started on levofloxacin 750mg IV for CAP given no other localizing findings. Her HR was persistently in the 130s for her ED course. She was given Diltiazem 15mg IV, then 20mg IV, and then 30mg PO. This slowed her rate transiently to the 90s. She was then put on a diltiazem gtt which was titrated up to 10mg/hr with persistent tachycardia noted to the 130s. BPs were stable in the 110s systolic, but it was felt that she would trigger on the floor for tachycardia so she was transferred to the ICU.  She has PIV access and was reportedly breathing comfortably, but did get 3.5 Liters of IVFs in the ED.  Prior to transfer to the ICU, she was noted to be afebrile, pleasant, conversive with a HR=130s, BP=137/90, and satting 98% on 2L. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Review of systems after the patient's mental status improved was notable for  worsening shortness of breath over the last several few months.  She had noted a dry cough. She denied orthopnea, fevers, chills, night sweats, change in bowel habits, hematochezia, abdominal pain, chest pain, palpitations, nausea, and vomiting.  No notable weight loss or gain.  She denied PND. 
83F found down [**2805-5-22**] for unknown length of time in a pool of foul smelling urine. Patient has a PMH notable for CAD, vascular dementia, diastolic CHF, interstitial lung disease, HTN, and prior admission where she was found down with AMS/fever/tachycardia on [**2804-11-19**]. She regained consciousness when aroused but remained lethargic and confused. EMS was called and noted O2 sat 84% of and systolic BP in 80s. . In the ED, patient's initial vital signs were: 103.2 122 112/48 28 98% 4L NC. Blood and urine cx were obtained and patient was given levaquin/CFTX for fever without a clear source of infection. She then became hypotensive to SBPs of 60 despite 3-4L NS resuscitation and required levophed at 0.15 via a RIJ. CXR showed mild pulmonary edema. Labs were notable for CK of 5000. Pt was also evaluated by neuro in the ED for question of new onset R sided weakness/facial droop. Head CT was negative, LP bland. CT abdomen/pelvis was also obtained for belly pain which showed no acute intra-abdominal process. Patient was transferred to the MICU [**Location (un) **]. . In the MICU patient continued to meet criteria for SIRS (T102.5 HR 120-140 MAP 104 on levo, RR 26 98% on CPAP and CXR was concerning for atypical or viral pneumonia. Her coverage was therefore broadened to vanc/zosyn, CT chest was obtained showing no PE. Viral swab was obtained which returned positive for parainfluenza; abx were discontinued.  On [**2805-5-23**] patient was weaned off pressors, HR decreased with metoprolol. Patient was weaned off CPAP with the help of nebs, lasix diuresis, and methyprednisone. Patient's clinical response to stress steroids raised suspicion for adrenal insufficiency [**1-26**] acute illness or chronic disease. She was continued on dexamethasone on transfer to the floor so that AM cortisol could be measured should she remain hypotensive when steroids were stopped. Her CK also trended down on IVF (5000-->2969-->941-->559). Patient made adequate urine with no serious electrolyte derangements during admission. 
This is an 85 year-old woman with a history or recurrent UTIs as well as a history of mild ILD, hypertension, diastolic CHF, CAD and mild vascular dementia with multiple recent hospitalizations for pan-sensitive e coli UTIs who presents from her [**Hospital 4322**] facility with fever and decreased responsiveness as found by the staff at her [**Hospital3 **] facility two hours prior to arrival. Her nephew explains that due to her history of recurrent UTIs she is seen by [**Name8 (MD) **] NP[**MD Number(3) 17953**] ALF every Friday. This past Friday she was noted to have a fever and a chest x-ray and he thinks a UA was checked. Per his report she was not started on antibiotics because there was no physician available to write for them over the weekend and she and her family want to keep her out of the ED as much as possible. In the ED, initial VS were: temp 104, defervesced to 99 after rectal acetaminophen and fluids. UA positive. EKG: sinus tachycardia. CXR: similar to prior with left diaphragmatic paralysis. Mental status improved significantly. BP still low. Fluids: 4.5 L crystalloid which was stopped given concern for pulm edema. The patient does not want a central line right now, but is okay with us starting peripheral norepinephrine, which currently is at 0.6mcg/kg. She was given vancomycin 1 gram and cefepime 2 grams for GU coverage, and flagyl 500mg IV for concern for cdiff at her nursing home. VS at time of transfer were 99.2 82 91/38 22 97% 2LNC. On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were hr 70 bp 75/57 97% on 4L. She appeared comfortable and had no specific complaints. Patient and nephew confirmed code status of DNR/DNI, with no central lines or arterial lines but they ok with fluids, antibiotics, and peripheral pressors. She does not think she would want blood however her nephew would ask that we further discuss this with him before not giving her blood if this was life-saving. Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations. Denies constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark or bloody stools. Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin changes. 
62 year old male has a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes and CAD s/p OM1 stenting in [**2566**]. Over the past six months the patient has been having episodes of what he describes as "anxiety attacks", associated with chest tightness. Many of these episodes have correlated with exertion although several months ago he did have some episodes that woke him from sleep. Last evening while taking the dogs out into his back yard he had additional chest tightness, unassociated with any other symptoms. Stress testing in [**2577-7-28**] revealed new septal hypokinesis with exercise. He was referred for left heart catheterization. He was found to have three vessel diseae and is now being referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization. 
104M w/ h/o CHF, CAD s/p NSTEMI, Afib on dabigatran, brought in by his son due to confusion lethargy and markedly slurred speech for approximately one week. At baseline, he has clear speech, is oriented, and can walk independently for very short distances. Per the patient's son, the patient has had no specific complaints, however for the last week and a half he has had slurred speech and dizziness. He was recently changed from Plavix to dabigatran. [**2725-11-17**] he was seen in the ED for hypoxia and discharged on an increased dose of Lasix 120mg daily. [**2725-12-7**] his son called his cardiologist's office with a complaint of dizziness. The next day he was noted to be hypotensive with a pressure 70/60. His lasix was held, but he continued to have symptoms. This morning, his son held all his medications except for ASA 81 and dabigatran. He has had a couple of mild episodes of epistaxis. He continued to have slurred speech and hypotension, so he was brought in to the ED. . In the ED, initial vs were: 86.9 50 120/48 18, on a Non-Rebreather. Noted to have an intact neuro exam except for incomprehensible speech. Started on bair hugger and given warmed fluids. Found to have guaiac positive brown stool. SBPs down to the 70s, so a R IJ was placed. Head CT negative. CXR showed chronic R sided effusion. Soon after 98% on RA. Patient was given vanc, zosyn and 3L IV fluids. He was given 1 unit PRBC's. lactate 2.0. . On the floor, patient is coherent, though his speech remains slurred. He denies pain and is unable to provide further ROS. 
35 y/o male with SLE/Myositis overlap, dCHF, HTN, CKD who presents with diffuse arthralgias, blurry vision, N/V and CP reproducible with palpation. These symptoms have been waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 681**] for 2 weeks. The pt took Prednisone 50 mg last night per his PCP although has been off home prednisone since [**Month (only) **]. LE edema is roughly at baseline, as is L ankle tenderness. Patient's HbA1c was 7 in [**Month (only) **] and has not had a previous admission w/ hyperglycemia and does not have a formal diagnosis of DM. . In the ED, initial VS were HR 77, BP 145/82, RR 22, Sat 98% RA, BG critically high . ROS notable for + cough, muscle aches, blurry vision, HA. Neg for SOB, CP at rest. Labs were notable for glucose of 1065, chem of  118* 6.2* 71* 27 45* 2.5. Urine however was negative for ketones. EKG showed SR@93 NA/NI inf-ant STD c/w prior. Bedside US of heart - no effusion. CXR was unremarkable for any new consolidation, or infectious process. . Pt was given 3L NS, morphine 4mg X 2 and was started on insulin 10 meq/hr gtt in the ED. Per his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **], who talked to him over the phone yesterday, "We had deferred steroids given side effect profile, but probably cannot do that anymore. See my telephone note from last night; has some serositis, fatigue. If this is not renal failure and indeed a flare of his myositis/serositis, we may have to give him pulse methylprednisolone, would consult with [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 1648**] his outpatient rheumatologist. His outpt therapy is hydroxychloroqine and myfortic (though myfortic he has not been able to tolerate b/c of GI sx, may be related to current flare). He also gets rituxan.". On arrival to the MICU, the patient was well oriented and vitally stable. . Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies chills, night sweats, recent weight gain. Denies sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies shortness of breath, or wheezing. Denies palpitations, or weakness. Denies diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency. Denies rashes or skin changes. 
The patient is an 89-year-old woman with complaints of incontinence and difficulty ambulating and headaches.  The patient reported recent falls including [**2707-3-26**], and a month prior to admission. The patient per EMS attempted to ambulate on the morning of discharged from rehabilitation recovering from a fall and admitted on [**2-9**] with head CT.  On the day of admission she complained of left-sided weakness. 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 22400**] is an 89-year-old seen on [**3-26**] with increased difficulty ambulating, incontinence, headache, falls and left sided weakness.  She was found to have right sided subdural hematoma on the [**3-28**] and she continued to have left facial and upper of [**Month (only) 115**] from the rehabilitation and she was doing well. Secondary to increased lethargy and mild headache, she was noted to be holding her right arm in a flex position and was noted to have soft voice and increasing lethargy.  The CT scan in the Emergency Room showed increased volume of the subdural hematoma on the left side with compression of the lateral ventricles and subfalcial herniation with increased signs at this time are blood pressure 188/93, saturations 97% on room air and pulse was 80 and regular. 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 22400**] is an 89 year-old lady seen on [**3-26**] with increased difficulty ambulating, incontinence, headache, falls and left sided weakness.  She was found to have right sided subdural hematoma on the [**3-28**].  secondary to increased lethargy and mild showed increased volume of subdural hematoma on the left side with compression of the lateral ventricles and subfalcine herniation.  She also had elevated blood pressures at this time.  This had been drained and she was discharged to rehab. She was brought back to the hospital on the [**3-30**] by her son, because of increasing lethargy and weakness.  Repeat head CT showed an enlarged subdural hematoma, which required 
64 yo F s/p RCA stent and CVA, with 3+MR followed by echo, referred for surgery. 
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 6611**] is a 64 year old female who recently underwent a bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement and Maze procedure on [**2518-1-6**]. Her hospital course was rather uneventful and she was discharged on postoperative day seven. She re-presented with multiple vague complaints including RUQ abdominal pain and right flank pain. The pain was described as dull and was rated a [**7-5**]. Patient also  admitted to some nausea and vomiting which was associated with some fevers, and chills. She denied rigors, weight loss/gain, bleeding and change in bowel habits. She did describe her urine as a dark, amber color. Initial evaluation was notable for elevated LFT's, elevated BNP, elevated white count, supratherapeutic INR along with a slight increase in creatinine. She was therefore admitted for further evaluation and treatment. 
History was obtained primarily from the pt's wife. Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6546**] is a very pleasant 61 yo man with severe chronic venous stasis dermatitis and frequent LE cellulitis, DM2, CAD, diastolic dysfunction, COPD (FEV1 0.82, 33% predicted) and osteoarthritis who was brought in to the ED this morning because of confusion. . The wife reports that he was in his USOH, which is generally poor, until about four days PTA, when she noted the onset of mild confusion. She was unable to encourage him to come to his PCP or to the ED. She reports that he began having nausea and dry heaving as well, and he was unable to keep down significant oral intake. She reports that he also had decreased urine output ocver the past two days PTA. In addition, she reports that he has been having visual hallucinations at home. . Although he has OSA and has chronic difficulty sleeping, she reports that he has had even more difficulty lately. . She does not report significant change in the appearance of the pt's legs, although they chronically appear infected. He has not recently been on antibiotics (last course reportedly in [**9-7**]). . She deniss that he has had fevers or chills, but he has had some myoclonic jerks. . The pt denies shortness of breath, chest pain or bleeding from anywhere. He reports chills, but no fevers. He denies a cough or significant sputum production. . In the ED, his initial VSs were 99.2, 76, 108/75, 90%RA. His initial FSBS was 60, and he was given a [**2-1**] amp of D50 with some improvement in his confusion. He also received vancomycin, cefepime, aspirin, and calcium gluconate and insulin for hyperkalemia. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is an 84 year old [**Doctor First Name **] speaking gentleman with a history of severe interstitial lung disease, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease and chronic renal failure who experienced worsening shortness of breath over the day prior to admission.  The patient at home had oxygen saturations in the 70s on 3.5 liters by nasal cannula and right-sided chest pain.  The patient had been drinking Ensure the few days prior to admission.  In the Emergency Room the patient was diagnosed with presumed congestive heart failure exacerbation and worsening of his interstitial lung disease.  He received Lasix and was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further treatment. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was well-appearing elderly man in mild respiratory distress.  Sclera were clear.  Neck, notable for jugulovenous distension and tenderness in his right calf.  His chest showed audible crackles bilaterally but cleared anteriorly.  His cardiac examination was normal S1 and S2, II/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex.  His abdomen was benign with mild hepatomegaly.  His extremities showed trace bilateral pedal edema and neurologically he was intact. LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had an elevated white count of 19.1, hematocrit of 38.4, platelets 264.  Chem-7 134, 5.5, 95, 24, 58, 119, 274.  The patient's INR was noted to be 7.4. Creatinine kinase was 71, troponin was 3.7.  His electrocardiogram was ventricularly paced in 70's, no ischemic changes.  His chest x-ray showed diffuse alveolar interstitial changes, likely superimposed congestive heart failure or interstitial lung disease. HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pulmonary - The patient suffers from respiratory distress, likely secondary to both congestive heart failure and worsening of his interstitial lung disease. This has been an acute and chronic progression of this disease which is likely a terminal process.  Despite aggressive treatment with Prednisone and antibiotics, the patient was aggressively diuresed for congestive heart failure component, continued on his Prednisone and treated with Nitroglycerin drip, Captopril, Digoxin, Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone and Morphine.  He continued to have significant oxygen requirement and intermittently complained of shortness of breath.  After extensive conversations with the family it was agreed that the patient would be taken home for home hospice care given the likely terminal prognosis and progression of his interstitial lung disease and congestive heart failure, and the fact that there was little medical treatment that we could provide at this point to cure this condition. 2.  Cardiac - The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure.  He was treated with Nitroglycerin, Lasix and Morphine.  The Nitroglycerin drip was weaned off and the patient was started on Nitroglycerin patch.  When the Nitroglycerin drip was turned initially the patient experienced some right-sided neck pain and chest tenderness that possibly could have been ischemic in origin. The patient requires aggressive treatment with Morphine, Nitroglycerin and ACE inhibitor to minimize his discomfort related to the ischemic pain.  In addition, the patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which was supertherapeutic in his INR.  The Warfarin was discontinued on his admission and was not restarted given the hospice disposition. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Poor. DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home hospice. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1.  Severe interstitial lung disease 2.  Congestive heart failure 3.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 4.  Hypertension 5.  Chronic renal insufficiency DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.  Fluoxetine 10 mg p.o. q.d. 2.  Prednisone 60 mg p.o. q.d. 3.  Bactrim one DS tablet three times a week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday 4.  Digoxin 125 mcg p.o. q.d. 5.  Nitroglycerin patch 0.6 mg per hour, transdermal to be changed every 24 hours, titrate to no chest pain 6.  Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. 7.  Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. 
History is obtained from the medical record and from the patient with her son serving as interpreter. Please see also OMR notes by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from [**2664-6-9**] and Dr. [**Name (NI) **] from [**2664-4-8**] for additional information. Briefly, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 21266**] is a 80 year old Persian woman who has multiple medical problems including diet-controlled type II diabetes, hypertension, chronic joint pain (osteoarthritis and seronegative RA vs. PMR), and recent visual problems with ocular discomfort. She has had recent complaints of chest pain and progressive dyspnea on exertion (to the point where she has had to crawl up stairs and sit down while shopping) for which she has been evaluated by Dr. [**Name (NI) **]. . In terms of her chest pain and DOE, she describes both as occurring together. The chest pain is present constantly, ranging from severity of [**2-4**] to [**9-5**] and is worse with movement, pressure to the chest wall, deep breathing, or exertion. The shortness of breath is only with activity and does not occur at rest. She describes the chest pain as pressure-like in quality and occuring in the center chest to beneath the left breast. She has had these symptoms for several months but feels that they have been getting worse recently. She has had a cough for about the last two months which is occasionally productive of white sputum; she initially thought that this was due to a cold and had some associated runny nose, though now feels cough is not due to URI as it has persisted. . She underwent echocardiogram in [**2-/2664**] which showed mild LVH with preserved ejection fraction (> 55%) and was otherwise unrevealing in terms of etiology for her dyspnea. In addition, she has had periodic complaints of heart palpitations for which she was been monitored by [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts; 7 symptomatic episodes revealed sinus rhythm at rate 60s-80s with occasional APBs and atrial bigeminy.  She did undergo stress test back in [**2654**] by Persantine MIBI which was negative for ischemia, but has had no further stress testing since that time. Currently, she is awaiting ophthalmologic procedure for her eye discomfort, and her ophthalmologist at Mass Eye & Ear has recommended complete cardiac work up prior to this procedure (details unclear as notes are out of our system; however, per Dr.[**Name (NI) 21267**] clinic note from [**2664-6-9**] it is "non urgent"). In addition, per Dr. [**Name (NI) 21268**] note from [**2664-4-8**], cardiac catheterization is indicated to evaluate for left main disease prior to surgery requiring monitored anesthesia care, as well as to further evaluate for coronary artery disease given her multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis.  She had cardiac catheterization planned recently, although this procedure was cancelled given her aspirin allergy and the possible need for intervention. The patient was given the option of waiting for allergy appointment to further evaluate this allergy or for CCU admission for rapid desensitization, and chose the latter. . On review of systems, she denies any recent fever, chills, nightsweats or rigors. She denies prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery. No PND or clear orthopnea (must sleep on her side secondary to back/spine pain). She does have swelling of the ankles which has been stable, as well as swelling in the knees from her arthritis (L > R). She has had palpitations for which sh has worn KOH monitor as above. She has multiple myalgias and joint pains for which she is followed in rheumatology clinic; these are stable. Cough as per HPI with no hemoptysis. No N/V/D/C, no abdominal pain, no changes in bowel habits (last BM this morning, normal), no black stools or red stools. She has had several episodes of LH over the past several days, most recently two days ago when she felt lightheaded after getting out of a car and had to sit and hold her head. No syncope. No dysuria or hematuria. All of the other review of systems were negative. 
61 yo Russian-speaking man w/anoxic brain injury and with hx of DMI, s/p cadaveric kidney transplant([**2715**]), h/o CVA and chronic aspiration (multiple admissions for aspiration PNA - last [**3-21**]), CABG in [**2710**], widespread tracheomalacia with trach stent, and recent admission to the ICU from [**Date range (2) 21288**] for PNA, stent removal and tracheostomy.  He was treated for aspiration PNA with Vanc, Levo, Flagyl and then switched to Cefepime and Azithro to complete a 10 day course.  He was also given Cipro x 7 days for a UTI.  He was discharged with a dobhoff feeding tube and on tube feeds.  He was found today at rehab to be hypoxic to the mid-80s. Suction was attempted but did not show improvement and he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. . In the ED, initial vs were: T100.4 HR102 BP163/93 RR24 O2sat96. Patient was given Vanc, Cefepime, Azithro and Solumedrol 125mg IV x 1.  He was given Kayexalate PR for potassium of 5.7 and aspirin for troponin of 0.62.  He was seen by IP due to possible air leak as he was pulling tidal volumes of 200.  The plan was to replace his trach once in the ICU. . On the floor, he appears comfortable, unable to answer questions, not following commands. 
The patient is a 78-year-old woman with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home O2 2 liters and congestive heart failure, diastolic dysfunction, who presents with shortness of breath. Per report, the patient went to the Podiatry Clinic on day of admission.  Noted at that time that her O2 tank ran out of oxygen.  Was in waiting room with plans to go home, but had shortness of breath and possible anxiety, and a code was called.  She went to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Room, and received prednisone, oxygen, and felt better, and was waiting to be discharged to home. In the Emergency Room waiting department, however, she had increased lethargy, diaphoretic with an arterial blood gas on 8:53 of 7.15, 94, 92, 35.  The patient was placed on CPAP and BiPAP.  She was pale and cyanotic with O2 sats around 70% at the time.  She received Solu-Medrol 1215 mg IV and albuterol with 1 amp of D50.  She was previously intubated in [**3381-2-8**]. 
Pt. is an 84 year old female with a PMH significant for dementia, DMII, HTN, and mild-moderate MR who presents with shortness of breath and cough this am from a nursing home. The patient is unable to provide a medical history. patient received 40 mg IV Lasix in the ED along with Lopressor 10 mg PO, IV x2.

Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 3968**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with atrial fibrillation on warfarin admitted for multifactorial hypoxia secondary to pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and question of COPD exacerbation, transfered to ICU in setting of acute intracranial bleed s/p fall.  She was started initially on vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia, transitioned to community acquired coverage with cefpodoxime and azithromycin.  She was also given lasix for pulmonary edema which improved her respiratory symptoms.  There was also some concern initially for a potentialy COPD exacerbation, so she was given a dose of methylprednisolone 125mg then switched to prednisone.  She received one dose of prednisone, and it was discontinued. Patient fell out of chair around 3:30am morning of MICU admission.  Head CT showed small right subdural bleed, and mental status was alert and oriented x3. In late morning, patient complained of headache and had new word finding difficulties.  Neurosurgery was consulted and suggested repeat Head CT 12 hours after previous one and reversal of INR.  She was given 1 unit of FFP and 10mg IV vitamin K along with an extra dose of 40mg IV lasix in the late morning.  Because she sounded fluid overloaded on morning rounds, she had received an extra dose of 40mg IV lasix in addition to home dose 2mg bumex as well.  After FFP, patient developed respiratory distress, presumed to be secondary to flash pulmonary edema.  She was triggered on the floor for tachypnea.  She received an extra dose of 40mg IV lasix in early afternoon, and a foley was placed. Nitro paste was also placed. CXR showed pleural effusions, right greater than left, and pulmonary edema.  MICU consult was initiated, at which time, patient was verbally responsive to her name but not oriented and not able to hold conversation.  She was weaned from face mask to 2L nasal canula, on which she was satting 93%.  She underwent stat head CT which showed significantly expanded subdural hematoma bilaterally, left worse than right.  She had an episode of nausea with dry-heaving on return to the floor.  No mass effect was seen on CT.  Neurosurgery evaluated patient at bedside, had coversation with family that patient may recover if INR is reversed quickly. Patient was given another unit of FFP and transfered to the MICU for further management in setting of mental status and concern for potential respiratory instability. Of note, patient was also noted to be having loose stools on the floor.  Stool sample was sent for c diff prior to MICU transfer. On arrival to the MICU, patient was somnolent and tachypneic, unable to converse 
65 yoM w/ a h/o DMII, ESRD on PD, CAD, CHF w/ an EF of 25% and lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma (waldenstrom's) presents with 5 days of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea- having missed peritoneal dialysis for 2 days he became confused and was brought to the ER. Since admission he was found to have an elevated WBC count in his peritoneal fluid and started on vanc / ceftriaxone for possible bacterial peritonitis which is thus far culture negative. Since his admission his mental status has improved, abd pain and diarrhea has resolved, he is not nauseas but does lack an appetite.  He denies any CP, SOB, orthopnea or PND.  His main complaint is overall fatigue, no muscle aches.  He had a cough and sore throat and these symptoms also remain.  Of note his wife had exactly the same constellation of symptoms beginning roughly 1 week prior to his onset of symptoms (which was 1 week ago).  No fevers or chills.  Has noticed dry skin over the past few months.  Patient is on PD and does make urine (small amount), he lives at home with his wife and states he is fully independent. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7658**] is a 65 yo M with a h/o uncontrolled DMII, ESRD on PD, CAD, CHF w/ an EF of 25% and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who presents with altered mental status x 1 day. Patient was discharged Tuesday night following admission for SBP and foot infection; family states that he was slightly confused at time of discharge.  Wife states that he was disoriented and unable to eat or drink during the day on Wednesday.  Per family, he was unable to perform PD as usual.  Wife states that he was requiring constant supervision and that she was afraid he would fall.  She called daughter who states that he was somnolent, unable to complete a sentence, and unable to stand. Wife denies any fevers or rigors at home.  Daughter reports that he has been increasingly somnolent with incoherent thoughts since last week. . In ED, HR 74, BP 101/65, RR 21, SpO2 100% on NRB.  A CXR and CT head were performed.  Blood, urine, and peritoneal fluid were sent for culture, and he received a dose of vancomycin and zosyn.  Given his somnolence, patient was intubated in ED for airway protection.   He received normal saline 2 L, ASA 325 mg PR, Vancomycin 1 g, and Zosyn 4.5 g.  Following intubation, blood pressure dropped to 78/50 and levophed gtt was initiated. . 
The patient presented on [**2799-6-4**] for increasing extremity edema and shortness of breath despite being on peritoneal dialysis for the past five weeks for end-stage renal disease. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise negative. LABORATORY DATA:  Complete blood count and chemistry panel including creatinine were at baseline on admission.  Cardiac etiology ruled out via CK and EKG. The patient was admitted for conversion to hemodialysis in stable condition. HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. End-stage renal disease:  Peritoneal dialysis catheter was removed and a tunnel catheter was placed.  The patient underwent hemodialysis on [**2799-6-5**].  The patient remained stable until [**2799-6-7**] when the patient became hypoxic, developed rigors, tachycardia and temperature of 101.  The patient transferred to the intensive care unit. Intensive care unit course will be dictated separately by the intensive care unit team.  The patient was transferred back to the floor on [**2799-6-10**].  The patient's course has been stable since transfer.  Systolic blood pressure is back at baseline ranging in the 90s per primary care physician; afebrile and saturating greater than 91% on room air.  In preparation for discharge the patient was evaluated by PT as well as nutrition for albumin of 2.4.  The patient underwent another session of hemodialysis before discharge to ensure that the patient could tolerate the procedure.  The patient's blood pressure remained at baseline and the patient is asymptomatic status post dialysis. 2. Fever:  Etiology unclear.  The patient had been started on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole per vascular surgery at admission for nonhealing left foot ulcer.  The patient does not appear infectious on examination but osteomyelitis could not be ruled out.  The wound remained stable throughout examination.  However, urine was noted to be purulent at collection, and urosepsis became the working diagnosis during the patient's intensive care unit stay. Indocin, gentamicin, and vancomycin were started in the intensive care unit.  Metronidazole and levofloxacin were discontinued.  Panculture remained negative throughout hospital course.  Infectious disease consultation recommended cessation of all antibiotics except Zosyn to be continued for a 10-day total duration upon discharge. 3. Congestive heart failure:  No indication of decompensation during this admission. 4. Pleural effusion:  Diagnostic thoracentesis was consistent with transudate.  No organisms were isolated.  Further taps were deferred as the patient was asymptomatic. 5. Physical therapy:  The patient was evaluated by both occupational therapy and physical therapy.  It was deemed that the patient would need rehabilitation placement upon discharge.  The patient was discharged in stable condition on [**2799-6-15**]. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:  General:  Awake, alert, sitting up, lucid, appropriate.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rhythm, mild tachycardia.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally except lower one-fourth lung field that showed decreased breath sounds but no crackles. Abdomen:  Soft, distended, but nontender to palpation. Dressing removed from PD catheter site.  The site is now clean, no discharge, no erythema, and no edema.  Extremities: 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.  Left foot dressing is in place, dry, pressure boot in place. LABORATORY DATA:  Complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 8.6, hemoglobin and hematocrit 9.9/31/7, platelet count 164, physical therapy 13.7, PTT 30.7, interrupted 1.3.  Chemistry panel was sodium 140, potassium 4.3, chloride 104, bicarbonate 26, BUN 25, creatinine 4.2, glucose 111. IMAGING:  Echocardiogram from [**2799-6-9**]:  "Compared with the findings of the prior study, tape reviewed of [**2799-3-1**], the left ventricle was not dilated with similar systolic dysfunction.  The aortic valve gradient is now higher and calculated valve area is now marginally smaller.  Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.  Ejection fraction is now less than 15%." Chest x-ray of [**2799-6-12**] shows:  "Continual bilateral pleural effusion at bases." CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable. PROCEDURES: 1. Removal of peritoneal dialysis catheter from the abdomen. 
Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 21365**] is an 85 year old man, recently discharged from the intensive care unit, with history of prior DVT (now s/p IVC filter), HTN, CKD on HD, right lower extremity dry gangrene, presenting from his PCP/cardiologist's office where the pt had a chief complaint of worsening SOB and cough. Per ED notes (patient is poor historian) the pt has "not looked great" for the past few days. The pt is currently living at [**Hospital1 **], denies nausea, vomiting. Has been regularly attending dialysis. Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 21365**] has been residing at nursing home since his discharge, and has been feeling more weak and short of breath than usual in the last few days. Hemodyalisis has been limited secondary to hypotension. In the emergency department the pt's vital signs were: 98.5, P90, NP 70/48, RR22 and O2sat 96% on 3L. In the ED the pt received 2 or 3 liters IVF (although only 1L documented in ED papers), and had a chest x-ray that showed a new left-sided PNA and he got Vanc and Zosyn with improvement in SBP's to in low 100's. 
74-year-old woman who presented in [**2777-7-16**] to [**Hospital1 18**] c/o severe pleuritic chest pain. CT revealed small pericardial effusion. She has had multiple echocardiograms, most recently on [**2778-2-27**], showing a moderate-sized pericardial effusion with fluid consistent with blood or inflammation. She has never had any evidence of tamponade, pericardiocentesis was considered in [**2776**] for diagnostic purposes, though it was felt there was not enough fluid to tap at that time. She has had multiple episodes of shortness of breath, over the past several months and has developed chronic dyspnea on exertion. Also c/o lower extremity edema, worse on her right leg. Treated periodically with Lasix with some improvement in both breathing and lower extremity edema. Recently cardiac MRI consistent with constrictive pericarditis with a large pericardial effusion and large right-sided pleural effusion. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 1999**] is a 58 year old gentlemen with a PMH significant for HTN, ESRD on MWF HD, seizure disorder, Hepatitis B, and CHF admitted for altered mental status and fever. The patient was brought in to [**Hospital1 18**] by EMS after complaining of bilateral leg pain, HA, NBNB emesis x1, and RUE weakness. Upon initial presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS 102.4 120 16 175/100 100%RA. The patient was complaining of left-sided arm and leg weakness as well as a diffuse HA. Exam was notable for left facial droop, CXR with bibasilar atelectasis, and ECG was notable for peaked T waves with a potassium of 6.8. The patient was treated with bicarb, 10 units regular insulin, 1 amp D50, and kayexalate with improvement in potassium to 4.8. The patient received gentle IVF, vancomycin, pip/tazo, and ceftriaxone. An LP was attempted but the patient refused periprocedurally. Of note, the patient has a history of dialysis line infections, most recently in [**3158**] by tip culture and [**3160**] by swab. Following insulin administration, the patient became persistently hypoglycemic requiring 3 amps D50 and then continuous infusion for D10 at 100 cc/hr. The patient was then transferred to the MICU for further management. Currently, the patient denies HA, weakness, CP/SOB, f/c/s, n/v/d, abd pain, HA. The patient further denies any history of recent HA. . Review of systems: As per HPI. Patient states that he has a history of past CVA. Patient is anuri 
Patient is a 44-year-old gentleman with history of hypertension, diabetes, aortic root replacement x2 secondary to abscess of the aortic valve presenting to the Emergency Department on [**2-7**] with upper gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient has vomited blood, had complaints of low grade temperatures, and was admitted to the MICU. The patient had been admitted prior on [**2503-10-7**] to [**2504-2-5**] for the workup of the aortic root abscess; but was subsequently discharged to rehabilitation and then again represented to the Emergency Department on [**2-7**] with the upper gastrointestinal bleed. 
This is a 44-year-old patient with past medical history significant for aortic root replacement times two for recurrent endocarditis, neurologic impairment of unclear etiology, and chronic dependence on mechanical ventilation who presents from an outside hospital with fever.  He was recently at the [**Hospital6 643**] where he received a right hemicolectomy on the [**2504-2-10**] and was discharged to rehabilitation on [**2-22**].  On [**2-23**], he was noted to be tachypneic and anxious.  He was sent to [**Hospital3 1265**] Hospital where he was found to be in pulmonary edema on the basis of elevated blood pressure and chest x-ray consistent with failure.  He was diuresed with Lasix and ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes.  On the [**2-24**] he spiked a temperature to 101.5 and was pancultured.  He had a transthoracic echocardiogram to evaluate for valvular vegetations; this was negative.  Additionally, the patient's feeding tube was felt to be obstructed but a gastrografin study showed the tube to be patent.  Because of the extensive experience of this patient with the [**Hospital6 253**], he was transferred here for further management. 
The patient is a 44 year old male with a past medical history for aortic valve endocarditis status post aortic valve replacement with debridement and repair, systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, chronic ventilator dependent secondary to Intensive Care Unit myopathy and neuropathy, chronic Pseudomonal colonization, and hypercalcemia of unclear etiology.  He was discharged from the [**Hospital1 69**] Intensive Care Unit on [**4-8**], after a six month hospitalization for Pseudomonas pneumonia, recurrent aspiration, TJ tube placement, pancreatitis, and hypercalcemia.  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] Rehabilitation. One day later, the patient presented to [**Hospital6 3818**] with explosive vomiting.  He was noted to be febrile and hypotension to systolic blood pressure in the 90s, with baseline blood pressure in the low 100s.  His sputum was positive for Pseudomonas.  At [**Hospital6 3816**], the patient received one week of antibiotic therapy with gentamicin.  He was weaned off of pressors after one week. Tube feeds were held and the patient was evaluated by the Gastrointestinal and Surgery Department. Upper endoscopy was done by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7549**], showing a polyp in the stomach, and otherwise normal.  An abdominal CT scan was done, showing gallstones and small ascites.  The patient was sent back to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation. 
49 year old male with h/o severe MR s/p MVR [**8-/2508**], s/p AVR due to endocarditis in [**2501**], redo bioprosthetic AVR [**2502**] for endocarditis recurrence, CAD s/p CABG [**2502**] with SVG to RCA and SVG to LAD, HTN who presented to the ED at [**2530**] with chest pain and dyspnea, N/V, loose stools. Pt initially received SL NTG and ASA in ambulance on way to ER and was on CPAP. BP 170/100 on presentation, HR 80 in SR. ECG showed STE anterior leads with lateral depressions. TTE done in ED and seen by cardiology. CXR with pulmonary edema and given 80 IV lasix, became hypotensive to 80. He was given 2L IVF, SBP improved to 100. Blood and urine cx's sent, given vanco and gentamicin. He subseqently developed rapid AFib to 110, became more dyspneic and was intubated. Became hypotensive to 60s in setting of intubation. A-line was placed with SBP 107, transferred to CCU. On arrival pt was hypotensive to 70's, started on levophed, L femoral central line placed. Pt was transferred to cath lab for emergent IABP, in addition R sided cath revealed severe MR. During this time, increasing difficulty with ventilation and hypercarbic acidosis, despite attempts at various types of ventilation, limited by resp pressure in high 40's. Pt was paralyzed with vecoronium to aid with ventilation. After IABP added, SBP improved to 90's, however continued difficulty oxygenating, ABG pH 7.06/79/83. PCW 41, Fick CI 2.78. On evaluation, pt is intubated and sedated. 
The patient is a 74 year old female who was transferred from an outside hospital to undergo a cardiac catheterization.  The patient had been complaining of shortness of breath with one flight of stairs exertion.  She also complained of some left arm discomfort during her dyspneic episodes, however, did not complain of any chest pain.  She denies any nausea or vomiting.  She does complain of a baseline dyspnea on exertion of approximately one mile.  She denies any paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea or syncope. 
The patient is an 85 year old gentleman with hypertension who presented with decompensated heart failure. He originally noted dyspnea on exertion two months prior to admission. He experienced shortness of breath after walking one city blood and experienced mild sporadic chest pain with and without activity. He also developed bilateral lower extremity edema and vascular congestion with increased neck veins. In [**11-29**] patient had an ETT MIBI which showed partially reversible defects in the area of the PDA and LAD, new since [**3198**]. EF was 35-45%. In [**3198**] EF had been 50%. MIBI showed moderate global LV hypokinesis, mild asymm LVH, mild PA HTN. During that MIBI patient had AVNRT and sinus tachycardia. Patient presented for elective cath which showed normal coronaries but the following pressures:  RA 32/RV 64/21 PA 72/32, wedge 35. PA sat 46%. CO 2.9 and CI 1.6. Pt was given 100 lasix in lab and put on natrecor drip at 0.01 and milrinone at 0.325. Transfered to CCU. Of note, INR was 1.8, and there was significant oozing from groin post sheath pull. 
[**Age over 90 **]yo male with history of congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, gout, GERD, anemia, and possible MDS was admitted from the ED with weakness. . He initially presented to geriatrics clinic with 2-3 weeks of diarrhea and vomiting. Additional review of systems was notable for the following: poor intake, decreased appetite. He denied fevers, shaking chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, abdominal pain, bright red blood per rectum, muscle aches, and pain. . Upon arrival in the ED, temp 98.3, HR 70, BP 75/45, and pulse ox 97%. His exam was notable for dry mucous membranes, irregular heart rate, and decreased skin turgor. His abdominal and pulmonary exams were unremarkable. He received levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1, metronidazole 500mg IV x 1, potassium chloride 20mEq IV x 1, and 1L NS IVF. RUQ US demonstrated unchanged cholelithiasis and CXR was unremarkable. He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for further management of his hypotension and weakness. Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] he reports feeling much improved with improved strength. 
82 yo woman with extensive vascular history (below), breast cancer in the past s/p L mastectomy in [**3022**], htn, high chol, and possible diagnosis of colon cancer treated 2 yrs ago with chemo which she self-d/c'ed, who had presented for elective angiography for lower extremity ischemia, and had developed nausea felt to be angina equivalent.  After heparin gtt, she went for cardiac cath on [**2-12**] PM and was found to have patent grafts and 3vd, though low flow to LIMA and RLE vessels, thus s/p stenting of right CIA and L subclavian.  She developed left sided weakness since then, unknown last well time. Heparin was used prior to the cath, which was stopped at noon on [**2-13**]; she did well during the procedure, although post-procedure there was a groin hematoma and hematocrit drop requiring 2 units prbc's. She moved well on exam last night.  This morning, there was no neuro exam performed, but she was apparently talking, with no facial droop and normal language (?8 or 9AM).  Cardiovascular exam was considered to be stable.  Just after 9AM she was seen by the nurse, who found her to be unresponsive to voice; soon afterwards, she had returned to [**Location 230**].  At 11AM she was seen by the resident and appeared to have, once more normal language and speech, but she was not moving the right side of her body. Neuro was contact[**Name (NI) **] at 11:15 and arrived at 11:30AM.  Initial NIHSS was unscorable because the patient was able to open eyes, but did not speak at all, did not blink to threat on the left, withdrew minimally to noxious stimuli (decreased on the left upper extremity).  DTRs were [**Name2 (NI) 3428**] at the knees and toes were mute. She was seen ten minutes later and language function was back to normal with normal naming and speech, but a dense homonomous hemianopsia, extinction to double simultaneous stimulation over the left hemibody, weakness of the left arm, NIHSS of 5.  On further questioning later with family present, "peripheral vision on the left" has been worse over the past month, though she also has cararacts. 
76 y F with h/o ESRD on HD who generally gets her care at [**Hospital1 577**] admitted to [**Hospital1 68**] last night for AV fistula bleed and possible lower GI bleed being transferrred to the MICU for low blood pressures. . She initially presented to [**Hospital1 68**] for concern for left AV fistula bleeding, which was recently redone and starting to be used last week. Since then, it has been bleeding after hemodialysis which she first noticed at home, so came in for evaluation. . In the ED, her SBP's ranged from 78-82 persistently. Her initial HCT was 34, and she was admitted for concern for GI bleeding. Her coumadin was held. She was admitted to the medical floor, but triggered in the morning of [**2617-5-15**] for SBP 80 - she was mentating fine and on further review was felt to be close to her baseline. ICU admission was requested for closer monitoring in the setting of possible GI bleeding. . ROS: In addition to above, pt had lightheadedness earlier but currently does not feel dizzy either sitting or standing. She is hungry. She has no chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills. She had some nausea on Monday with mucoid vomiting but no blood. She complains of some weakness of both legs, which is equal and at her baseline. 
The patient is a 57 year old morbidly obese female who has been immobile at home who presents to the Emergency Department with a five day history of shortness of breath.  At home she had been on 4 liters of increasing amount of oxygen secondary to shortness of breath. She denies any fevers, chills, cough or chest pain.  She does admit to some diarrhea at home.  In the Emergency Department she became grossly more short of breath.  She was given nebulizer treatment and nasal cannula was increased to 10 liters.  The arterial blood gases was 7.28, 82, and 42.  Her baseline carbon dioxide from [**2720-1-15**] is 48.  Because Department. 
This is a 58-year-old female with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presents with hypoxia, per [**Hospital6 380**].  The patient had been found by [**Hospital6 380**] on the morning of admission confused, with shortness of breath, and an oxygen saturation of 79% on room air.  The patient initially reported a sore throat, tightness, and chest pain which was not reported by the patient on presentation to the Emergency Department. Ms. [**Known patient lastname 6393**] had recently been admitted to [**Hospital1 47**] a few days before with a workup for subacute renal failure.  At that time, it was decided that Ms. [**Known patient lastname 6394**] renal failure was likely secondary to hypovolemia.  She was given intravenous fluids, and her usual dose of 80 mg p.o. of Lasix b.i.d. was held.  The patient's creatinine peaked around 4.1, and at discharge was 2.9. Currently, the patient is disoriented, awake, and alert.  She has no complaints of chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, sore throat or shortness of breath.  In the Emergency Department, she was given Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 40 mg intravenously times one, Solu-Medrol 120 mg times one, albuterol nebulizers, bicarbonate, D-50, and intravenous insulin.  This was in response to a white blood cell count of 8.4, potassium of 6.1, and a blood urea nitrogen of 54, and creatinine of 2.6. 
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post multiple myocardial infarctions in the past, status post right nephroureterectomy on [**2506-3-15**] for a transitional cell carcinoma, who presented on the day of admission to [**Hospital3 **] with worsening lower extremity edema and exertional dyspnea since discharge. The patient awoke on the morning of admission with acute dyspnea and presented to [**Hospital3 **] where his electrocardiogram revealed new lateral ST depressions of 2 mm in V5 through V6 which was initially read as left ventricular hypertrophy with strain, and he had an initial creatine kinase of 40 with a negative troponin, but an oxygen saturation of 85% on room air.  The patient was given Lasix 120 mg intravenously, nitroglycerin, morphine sulfate, given 100% nonrebreather, and his oxygen saturation improved to 100%.  He was diuresed and sent to the [**Hospital1 341**]. On review of the patient's history, he admits to having frequent bologna sandwiches and can soups and was unaware of their sodium content. At [**Hospital1 69**], the patient had a blood pressure of 130/54, pulse of 72, respiratory rate of 26, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on 50% Venturi mask with electrocardiograms that revealed 1-mm ST depressions in V5 through V6. The patient was admitted to the C-MED Service, and several hours later suffered acute worsening dyspnea with 5/10 chest pain, and diaphoresis, and an electrocardiogram that showed ST depressions in II and F as well as V4 through V5, with a rate of 120, and a blood pressure of 150/90.  The patient was given intravenous nitroglycerin, morphine, Lasix, and heparin. He was taken to the catheterization laboratory where he had a pulmonary artery pressure of 62/30 and wedge of 35.  He was found to have a left main coronary artery with a 40% distal lesion, left anterior descending artery with a 50% proximal lesion, left circumflex with a 50% middle lesion, second obtuse marginal and third obtuse marginal were totally occluded, right coronary artery with a 70% proximal lesion. An echocardiogram revealed global hypokinesis, left ventricular ejection fraction of 20%, and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation. The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for observation, diuresis, and afterload reduction in the setting of 3-vessel disease and left ventricular dysfunction. 
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with hypertension, CAD, diabetes and peripheral vascular disease with LE ulcerations presenting with nausea and generalized weakness.  The patient's overall health and functional status have been declining over the last [**5-1**] weeks, described by the family as decrease in walking due to sense of instability, difficulty with stairs, difficulty writing, insomnia and general tiredness, including falling asleep during ADLs and frequently during the day.  Her cognition, in general, has been intact until recently when her family has noted mild clouding. Her brother passed away three days ago and the patient was able to travel to the funeral in [**Hospital1 782**].  Per her family, she has been eating and drinking normally, and taking her medications. She complains of leg pain and pain in her bottom.  On the day of admission, she was in her most recent normal state of health. She ate breakfast and took all her pills. She tried to have a BM prior to a lunch party and was unable to get off the commode. She complained of nausea, shortness of breath and dizziness. Her family notes that she was particularly fatigued after this and would fall asleep while speaking.  They called her PCP who recommended she come to the ED for evaluation. She normally sits on the toilet for 1-2 hours per day, and did this today, but when she went to get up she felt weak, nauseated and slightly short of breath.  She presented to the ED for evaluation. In the ED, vitals were:  98.8 58 110/70 18 100.  Laboratory evaluation revealed a potassium of 2.8 for which she received 40 mEq KCl, an indeterminate troponin, CRI at baseline renal function, and a leukocytosis with marked bandemia.  She was found to have cellulitis associated with chronic LE ulcerations and was treated with ceftriaxone and vancomycin.  CXR and UA were unrevealing for sources of infection.  She was found to have brown, trace guaiac positive stool.  While awaiting a bed on the medicine floor, the patient's heart rate dipped to 39. ECG obtained revealed a junctional rhythm.  Her blood pressure varied between SBP 90 to SBP 170.  Her HR stabilized in a sinus bradycardia with rate in 40s (without intervention).  Her mental status remained stable. She complained of some back pain.  It was reported that the patient was sleeping at the time of the bradycardia.  She was given 1 L NS at 200 cc/hr and 1 L NS with 40 mEq KCl at 150 cc/hr. Per HHA, right leg erythema and ankle wound new over last several days. Other LE changes stable. 
The patient is an 82 year old gentleman, well known to the vascular service, who was recently discharged after evaluation of a right foot ulcer.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 21934**] is an 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**10-14**]), s/p MCA CVA, afib, HTN, and DM II, recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 8836**] and [**Date range (1) 21935**] for HAP and UTI [**Last Name (un) **] transferred from [**Hospital **] hosp for hypotension. History is unclear as obtained from scant OSH records and patient unable to give history. He appears to have been at NH when found to sats 81% RA, foley draining dark amber urine. He was noted to have severe peripheral edema and given levoquin X 1 and lasix 40 mg IV X 1 at OSH. He became hypotensive to 80's at OSH, placed an EJ and started peripheral neo. In the ED, initial vs were: T 100, P 81, BP 107/58, R 18, 100% NRB O2 sat. Patient was given Vanc/Zosyn, tylenol, and 1L NS in ED. Bladder was changed in ED with UCx very positive and sent to ICU.

The patient is an 82 year old male nursing home resident with a past medical history of schizophrenia, mental retardation, questionable coronary artery disease, questionable atrial fibrillation, who presented to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department on [**3142-5-2**], after a witnessed aspiration done at his nursing home.  Per his nursing note, the patient choked on honey thickened food.  Shortly thereafter, moderate amounts of food were suctioned from his mouth.  He subsequently became hypoxic with oxygen saturation of 87% on 100% nonrebreather face mask.  Noted at that time to also have a heart rate of 154 and a blood pressure of 150/90.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] for further evaluation. In the Emergency Department, the patient was initially thought to be in congestive heart failure and so was treated with BiPAP noninvasive ventilation, Lasix 40 mg intravenously times one, morphine sulfate 2 mg intravenously times one and Nitroglycerin drip.  Oxygen saturation improved to 96% on these measures but reportedly his heart rate went up to the 190s.  His tachycardia was thought to be atrial fibrillation and he was therefore started on a diltiazem drip.  At that point, his blood pressure then dropped to 60 systolic. The patient was intubated with plans for cardioversion for his unstable heart rhythm.  Preintubation arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.44, pCO2 45, oxygen saturation 105.  Post intubation his blood pressure improved to the 120s systolic. Cardioversion was therefore aborted.  The Medical Intensive Care Unit team was called to evaluate the patient.  He continued to have tachycardia with heart rate into the 160s. He was volume resuscitated with seven liters normal saline to keep his blood pressure above 100 systolic. Chest x-ray at that time showed a left lower lobe infiltrate concerning for aspiration pneumonia.  The patient was started on ceftriaxone and Flagyl.  He was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  His Medical Intensive Care Unit course was notable for a switch of antibiotic coverage to ceftriaxone and clindamycin.  The patient continued with episodes of hypotension and the differential diagnosis which included over diuresis in the Emergency Department versus hypovolemia versus sepsis.  A central line and arterial line were placed. He was aggressively volume resuscitated with intravenous fluids.  Electrocardiograms were reinterpreted as multifocal atrial tachycardia and therefore the patient was switched to oral diltiazem.  Shortly thereafter he self converted to normal sinus rhythm.  He was weaned off the diltiazem drip on [**3142-5-3**].  An echocardiogram was performed which showed an ejection fraction of 50% and it was notable also for left atrial enlargement. While intubated, the patient was noted to have increased thick secretions but he continued to oxygenate and ventilate well.  He self extubated on [**3142-5-5**].  Post extubation, he was noted to be verbally abusive and combative.  Per collateral information obtained from his nursing home as well as case manager, this was felt to be the patient's baseline. On initial presentation, depakote was held because of mental status changes but in light of his agitation and combativeness, depakote was reinstituted.  The Psychiatric consultation service was contact[**Name (NI) **] for medication recommendations. The patient was restarted on Depakote, paroxetine, Seroquel, and trihexyphenidyl.  His Intensive Care Unit course also was notable for recurrent episode of multiple tachycardia in the evening of [**3142-5-6**].  This tachycardia subsequently resolved into pulmonary edema felt to be secondary to the patient's diastolic dysfunction.  Therefore, he was diuresed with Lasix.  A beta blocker was also started.  He continued to be stable and was transferred out to the regular medicine floor on [**3142-5-8**]. 
This is an 82-year-old Caucasian male with a history of schizophrenia and aspiration pneumonia, who was transferred from his nursing home with hypoxic respiratory failure after a witnessed aspiration event.  Per the nursing note, the patient choked on honey thick [**Location (un) 2418**] food at lunch with moderate amounts of food suctioned from his mouth.  The patient subsequently became hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 87% on a 100% nonrebreather mask.  Patient's heart rate at that time was 154, and his blood pressure was 150/90.  He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. In the Emergency Department, the patient was initially thought to be in CHF and was given Lasix 40 mg IV.  He then was given Morphine 2 mg and started on a nitroglycerin drip. His heart rate increased to the 180s and it was thought the patient was in atrial fibrillation.  Diltiazem was given. Patient then became hypotensive to a blood pressure of 70/65 and was intubated with plans for cardioversion.  The patient's blood pressure subsequently increased to 122/65 and cardioversion was aborted.  At this time, the MICU was called for evaluation.  Also in the Emergency Department, ceftriaxone and Flagyl were given for presumed aspiration pneumonia.  Albuterol inhalers were given and sedation was increased to a Versed drip.  The patient was then transferred to the MICU for further management. 
This is a 41 year old diabetic with multiple risk factors and known coronary artery disease referred for peripheral vascular angiography due to severe bilateral leg claudication.  He complains that his calf and thighs "ache 24 hours a day" over the past six months.  He has had progression in his symptoms.  He describes bilateral severe cramping behind both knees extending down to the feet. This occurred after walking only 20 feet.  The patient does not admit to rest pain.  The patient underwent PVRs which demonstrated distal superficial femoral artery, proximal popliteal disease with bilateral tibial disease.  The patient is admitted for elective diagnostic angiography. 
The patient, when he arrived to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, was an 83 year old male with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.  He presented to the Emergency Room with a clotted AV fistula and a ten point hematocrit drop from 32 to 22 and guaiac positive stools. The patient was on hemodialysis where the upper portion of his AV fistula was noted to be occluded and the patient was unable to be dialyzed.  According to the transfer note, while at rehabilitation, the patient's hematocrit was noted to gradually drop.  On [**2623-12-19**], it was 36.3; on [**12-29**] it was 25.0.  The patient was also noted to be guaiac positive with one out of two stool samples at rehabilitation and was noted to suffer from failure to thrive from upper chest pain, with swallowing both liquids and solids. On arrival to the Emergency Department, the patient's systolic blood pressures were in the 90s with a temperature of 100.8 F., and O2 saturations were 100% on two liters.  The patient's blood pressure then fell to 70/30 and the patient was given a fluid bolus with blood pressures increasing to 86/36.  The patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells in the Emergency Department and with the recent Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia on [**2623-12-20**], the patient was given Vancomycin one gram intravenously times one. The patient was noted to be persistently hypotensive with blood pressures falling systolic to the 70s and not responding to gentle intravenous fluid boluses given congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of greater than 25 to 30%.  The patient was started on Dopamine through his peripheral intravenous with transient increasing systolic blood pressures to the 80s until a right internal jugular line was placed.  The patient was then switched to Levophed as a preferred choice and was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring. 
(per OMR and the patient's family as he is unable to give history due to AMS): 83 yo male with DM, COPD, h/o MSSA PNA, CHF (multiple recent hospitalizations for decompensated CHF), AVR with restenosis (valve area 1.2 in [**Month (only) **]), recent admission for new Afib and symptomatic NSVT (no intervention but BB uptitrated),  found to have worsening O2 status at his rehab. Patient's daughter went to visit him at reham yesterday and his 02 was 'in the low 80s' on oxygen and he was coughing (non-productive).  They decided to try to increase his 02 and wait overnight to see if there was improvement, was given morphine sulfate x3 but had no improvement so family brought him to [**Hospital1 18**].  Patient's family notes that he seems more aggitated and uncomfortable today but otherwise similar mental status with poor short term memory, waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 681**] mental status. . On review of OMR notes, he has had multiple hospitalizations over last few months for CHF and pneumonia. He was admitted in [**10-20**] with L/R sided HF, readmitted in [**12-20**] with weight gain, SOB, found to be in acute heart failure complicated by new onset afib at which point he was started on coumadin. TTE at that time showed EF 45-55%, aortic valve area 1.2, severe [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1890**], 3+ tricuspid regurg, 2+ pulmonic regurg. mild diffuse hypokinesis and mild depression of contractility of L/R ventricle. Admitted again [**3211-1-29**] and intubated for acute respiratory decompensation [**3-15**] CHF, also treated for MSSA pneumonia. Admitted [**2-25**] for NSVT and new Afib, treated with increasing dose of BB.  Patient has also recently worked up for altered mental status thought most likely [**3-15**] toxic metabolic. . In the ED, initial vs were: 97.9 60 118/45 17 98 on.  Labs notable for a WBC count of 13.9, HCT 34.4, Cr. 1.7 and troponin 0.10.  BNP pending.  Lactate 1.0., INr 3.3. abg: Ph7.27 pCO2 76 pO2 78 HCO3 36. CXR with large right pleural effusion. Patient was given Vanco 1g IV, Levofloxacin 750mg, Ceftriaxone, and Methyprednisone 125.  He was then given aspirin 600 PR.  Cards was consulted who said it is likely demand due to a large pleural effusion with someone with known coronary artery disease.  They did not look at the EKGs. EKG showed v1 and v2 ST depressions, 1-2 mm.  Vitals currently: 61 120/41 98% on Bipap [**6-15**] 40%.  DNR/DNI confirmed with patient and his family in the ED. . On the floor, the patient is wearing bipap and appears to be working hard to breath.  He reports feeling like he can't breathe.  His family (3 daughters, one of whom is his HCP) report that he appears uncomfortable and again report that the patient wants to be DNR/DNI. . Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 659**], his PCP came in and a family meeting was held with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the MICU resident and the patient's 3 daughters. The family was updated on the patient's situation and his low likelihood of recovery without intubation (and very low likelihood of cure regardless).  All three sisters were in agreement that the patient was clear that he did not want to be intubated, they felt that intubation and CPR would cause him more suffering and felt comfortable with keeping the patient DNR/DNI.  Plan was to try lasix, antibiotics and Bipap to see if it was possible to improve the patient's respiratory status but to also make the patient comfortable with morphine even if this decreased his respirations.  The sisters requested a catholic priest for the patient as well as some time to update their other 5 siblings. . Review of systems(per family): (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, recent weight loss or gain. Denies sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.

75 year old man with mild dementia, CAD, s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM1/OM2, SVG to PDA),  and prior stent to OM2 graft, PVD, s/p fem [**Doctor Last Name **] in [**2694**], HTN, Aortic stenosis, CRI (cr 1.9), DM admitted on [**2705-4-29**] to [**Hospital3 **] with chest pain that was not relieved with nitro. Per patient, he has chest pain although not reliably with exertion that is usually relieved with one nitro. On Friday night he had his usual chest pain but it was not relieved with nitro. This pain was associated with SOB. It did not radiate but felt like pressure. He called the EMTs who told him to take an aspirin and brought him to [**Hospital3 **]. He was given lasix, labetolol, and nitro sl for SBP>200. BP came down to 150. The first troponin was indeterminate (0.16) in the setting of CRI. EKG showed NSR with rate 75bpm, 1st degree AVB with IVCD and 1mm ST depression in lateral aspect with no change from prior EKGs. On admission he also had SOB and CXR that was reportedly consistenet with CHF as well as mildly elevated BNP (627). He was given 40mg IV lasix and was admitted for ROMI and CHF exacerbation. The next day the patient underwent a nuclear stress test that showed diffuse ST depressions II, III, aVF, V4-V6. His troponins then rose with peak troponin of 4.77 and CKMB 16.8. Patient was started on heparin. He was not treated with plavix because of concern for three vessel disease and potential cardiac surgery. Trops then dropped back down to 2.99. The patient never reported CP while hospitalized. Last cath ([**2701**] at [**Hospital1 2148**]) showed patent grafts and 60% stenosis in SVG to OM2 which was not intervened upon. In [**2700**] patient had cath at [**Hospital1 18**] and had stent placed in SVG to OM2 graft. He was evaluated with MR of the spine at the OSH for h/o severe spinal stenosis and right-sided radiculopathy. There was consideration for epidural injection, however, because of the cardiac issues this was deferred. It was decided to transfer patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath and potential intervention on the OM2 lesion. VS prior to transfer:  144/68, 59 SB, 20, 97.6, 95% on room air. Patient was transferred directly to the cath lab at [**Hospital1 18**]. There he underwent cardiac cath with attempted intervention on OM2 lesion at end of previously placed stent, however, they were unable to pass the wire and no intervention was done. The patient's procedure was complicated by a groin hematoma. Pressure was held for 1.5 hours. Patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout.

This is a 61 year old man with a history of ventricular tachycardia status post ICD placement in [**3418**], aortic valve replacement and atrial fibrillation as well as diabetes mellitus type 2, who presents with probable cellulitis at the site of his ICD placement. It was recently discovered that the generator of the ICD was end-of-life, so approximately 6 weeks prior to admission, it was replaced.  The patient did well until about two days prior to admission when he noticed an increased inflammation, redness and tenderness at the site.  He denies fevers, chills, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, but does say that he has had In the distant past, he had had two episodes of subacute bacterial endocarditis and subsequently has been taking chronic PCN-VK. The patient also states that his discomfort at the time of admission is not similar to when he had subacute bacterial endocarditis.  He states that ordinarily he is active without chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations. 
77M with CLL, CAD, afib, CRI, DM1 presents with 2 days of worsening confusion. He is normally completely oriented and sharp. Over the course of 2 days, his mental status declining from mistaking the time of day to the point that he was noted to have 2 sets of clothes on. His family reports that the patient only c/o fatigue, decreased appetite the week leading up to the hospitalization. He had no fever, chills, HA, abdominal sxs, respiratory sxs, sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] had seen his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1009**] took a CXR that was reportedly clear and recommended CT torso, which the pt declined. When the pt did not improve, his family brought him to ED where his vitals were 97.3, 95, 129/61, 19, 96% RA. He received a CXR, a CT head, and labs which were all unrevealing. LP was deferred initially due to elevated INR. On HD#2, the pt underwent LP by the neurology consult service and was found to have 2375 WBCs which were 99% lymphocytes, protein of 212, and glucose of 128. Neurology felt this was c/w meningitis, possibly carcinomatous. He was started on vanc/ceftriaxone/amp/acyclovir. Oncology was consulted and reviewed the CSF with Heme path and felt that the CSF was c/w reactive lymphocytosis, NOT carcinomatous meningitis, (flow cytometry showed 99% reactive lymphocytosis and 1% CLL cells). During this hospitalization his mental status has deteriorated rapidly. Pt's family reported that he walked into the ED and was able to answer questions appropriately. This gradually deteriorated to only recognizing his family members on the floor to keeping his eyes shut, moaning, and grimacing on arrival to the ICU.

This is a 61 year old woman with a history of hypoglycemic episodes in the past of unknown etiology and she was found unresponsive at home by her family.  Emergency medical technician notes indicate a fingerstick glucose in the field of 28.  The patient was given 1 amp of D10 in the field with some improvement in her mental status.  The patient arrived in the Emergency Department and was hypotensive with a systolic [**Hospital Ward Name **] pressure of 74 and fingerstick going as low as 47.  The patient required Dopamine drip to maintain a [**Hospital Ward Name **] pressure despite repeated normal saline boluses, necessitating a Medicine Intensive Care Unit admission on [**2691-10-24**].  On arrival to the floor the patient had been off of pressors for 24 hours.  The patient had been transferred to the floor on [**10-27**] and the patient had received a hemodialysis session on [**10-26**].  The patient also had been on four days of Vancomycin upon transfer to the floor.  This was for one out of four bottles of gram positive cocci which were subsequently believed to be contaminate.  Upon transfer to the floor, the patient's fingersticks over night ranged from 85 to 150.  Upon transfer the patient denied any pain, nausea or shortness of breath.  She started to report poor appetite secondary to "bad cooking" of the hospital cafeteria.

78F PMH of type I DM complicated by nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy, osteoporosis, CKD (baseline Cr 2.0) and recent NSTEMI in [**6-/3491**] who is presenting with recurrent syncope [**1-22**] to short episdoes of asystole since this AM. . Patient has h/o of gastroparesis and chronic nausea and abdominal dyscomfort. She was at her baseline state of health until this morning. At noon after taking 2 bites of her sandwiched, she developed sudden nausea and had wretching X1, immediately there after she syncopized per her husband with some irregular limb movements w/o incontinence or tongue bite. Husband caught her she did not fall on the floor and did not hit her head. She reacovered after 30 seconds and came to quickly. She recalls feeling faint but otherwise denies any preceeding palpitaions, chest pain or other symptoms except nausea and wretching. After ~ 10 minutes she had another identical episode at which point her husband call EMS. En route EMS noted episode of 6s of asystole and patient becoming unresponsive. . Upon arrival to the ED VS: 98.2 59 140/53 17 100%RA, transcutaneous pacer pads were placed on patient. During observation in ED patient bradyed down to the 40's, then had about 10 second pause with syncope which ended with junctional beat then sinus took over in the 50's. Half a milligram of atropine was given with HR increasing only to the 60's. Initial Glu 100, but 50 on repeat for which she recieved IV D50% 50cc.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 26548**] is a 51 year old male with a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and end-stage renal disease who, during work-up for renal transplant, was found to have evidence of possible coronary artery disease after which he subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization which confirmed the presence of three vessel disease, including total proximal occlusion of the left anterior descending with no stump.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1519**] agreed to perform complete revascularization with the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending as the preferred method. LABORATORY:  The patient's initial labs showed a hematocrit of 31.8 with platelet count of 266.  His BUN and creatinine were 126 and 9.6 respectively. At the time of discharge, the patient's hematocrit was 30 with a platelet count of 225 and his BUN and creatinine were 66 and 7.1 at time of discharge. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was dialyzed for a few days preoperatively in order to optimize his preoperative condition.  Subsequent to his hemodialysis he underwent a three vessel coronary artery bypass graft on [**3203-6-26**], with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal; saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery, under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The pericardium was partially reapproximated.  He did have radial arterial lines placed and a left IJ Swan-Ganz and two ventricular and atrial pacer wires were used.  He was on coronary bypass for 64 minutes and crossclamp time was 51 minutes.  Subsequent to the procedure, he did have two mediastinal and one pleural tube. On transfer to the Recovery Room, his mean arterial pressure was 65 with a CVP of 11, a PAD of 12 and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1038**] of 15, and with an arterial based rhythm of 88 and the only drips he was on were Neo-Synephrine and Propofol which we planned to titrate down. He did well postoperatively and on postoperative day one, he was started on Lopressor and Lasix.  He was weaned to extubation and started on a heart diet.  Otherwise, there were no issues other than the continued hemodialysis. On postoperative day two, he was weaned off pressors.  He was transferred to the floor on postoperative day five, at which time, he underwent Physical Therapy and was able to accomplish his goals of reaching Level 5 quickly. Hemodialysis Service was arranged for him at his home near [**Hospital3 **] and Discharge Planning was initiated. CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   He was discharged in good condition, able to ambulate with minimal incisional pain and otherwise no respiratory distress. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1.

Mr [**Known patient lastname 11115**] is a 70 year old male with a history of prostate cancer and hepatitis B, who presented to the hospital with a several hour history of acute onset right upper quadrant abdominal pain. He was initially hypotensive, requiring blood products.  While stable, a CT scan was obtained that demonstrated two large liver lesions; one in the fourth segment of the liver and a second in the sixth segment.  One had an obvious blush with evidence of free intraperitoneal blood throughout the abdomen. He was aggressively fluid resuscitated with blood products, transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] from the [**Hospital 614**] Campus. 
Mr [**Known patient lastname **] is a 78 yom presented to OSH with epigastric pain, shortness of breath, cough and chills, s/p fall on his right chest with ecchymosis, diagnosed OSH with possible NSTEMI (BNP of 1100, TropT of 0.09, 0.13, 0.13), PNA, CHF with EF of 25%, and AAA (6.7x6.5 cm). At OSH ED, he was noted to have ecchymosis on the right chest, unable to lie flat and was hypotensive.  He was urgently intubated to perform CT scans of the chest and abdomen.

The patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**12-13**] after having two to three weeks of a viral syndrome with cough.  The patient was markedly sleep deprived and having hallucinations.  On hospital day number two the patient became progressively delirious and had decrease in mental status and was seen by neurology and thought to be in alcohol withdraw.  On the following day [**12-17**] the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital3 **] where he was intubated for a decrease in respiratory function and was intubated.  He developed pulmonary edema and most likely had a non Q wave myocardial infarction with increase in creatinine to 6.47.  His baseline creatinine is 2.5.  The patient's initial arterial blood gas was 7.06, 64 and 60. Troponins at that time were 6.47.  The patient had an echocardiogram at the outside hospital,which showed an EF of 35 to 40%, mitral regurgitation, hypokinesis in the mid distal septum and apex.  Neurological consult showed agitation confusion likely manifestation of withdraw.  The patient started on Ativan, multivitamins, thiamine and folate.  Nephrology was consulted for the increased creatinine in the setting of worse failure and chest x-ray. Lasix was started.  Head CT was negative.  Sodium was 121 and subsequently corrected. 
This is an 85 yo M with a PMH significant for NIDCM (EF 25% in [**2780**]), pAF on coumadin, stage IV CKD, HTN, and hyperlipidemia who presents with 1 week of progressive shortness of breath and wheezing. The patient was in his normal state of health until one week prior to admission when he noticed mild shortness of breath associated with exertion. Since then, this shortness of breath has been progressive and now occurs with only slight activities. The patient also notes audible wheezing during these episodes and he has had to sit frequently in order to catch his breath. The patient endorses stable 2 pillow orthopnea, no PND, no palpitations, no chest pain, no lightheadedness, no syncope. The patient notes medication compliance.

He was in normal healthy until the am of [**11-27**] when he experienced [**5-26**] substernal CP which was "squeezing" while watching TV.  It lasted for 30 minutes without associated radiation, SOB, nausea, diaphoresis, palpitations or lightheadedness.  He did not take medications for this incident. After dinner he lies down normally for approx 1/2 hour but has noticed SOB when supine over the past week.  He has gained 30 lbs over the last year.  He has had CP approximately 1X/year for which he usually takes Nitro. Patient's history is currently more variable.  He reports CP the night prior to presentation for which he took SL Nitro X3. He had chest pain the next am which did not respond to Nitro.  He had assocaited nausea.  Patient notes that he had seizures during these episodes- as he gets seizures the more he drinks. However, he states that he has not had a drink in 3 weeks since he went to rehab 2 weeks ago after being given an ultamatum by his wife. He went to the ED, and on the way experienced substernal chest squeezing, [**2-24**] which lasted a couple of minutes and resolved spontaneously. In the ED his VS were: 98.3, 92, 136/78, 92%/RA. His SBP dropped to 77 and he received 2L NS and ASA. He was initially started on high dose PPI given suspicion for reflux. The patient noted orthopnea and was found to be in respiratory distress.  He was admitted to the ICU with CHF and etoh withdrawal. He was agitated, tachycardic and hypertensive and then dyspneic with 3 inches of nitro paste, 120mg Lasix, 6mg IV ativan, 8mg IV morphine, 10mg IV lopressor.  He required intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure as his RR was 45, he was sating 85% on NRB. He was treated while intubated with Versed and Fentanyl. He was treated with Unasyn for a question of aspiration pneumonia.  He was extubated on [**12-4**] with continued aggressive diuresis. He ruled in for a NSTEMI with Trops up to 1.5. He was intubated and admitted ot he ICU and extubated on [**12-4**]. He was also requiring detox secondary to etoh abuse. On [**12-8**] he had a Persantine stress with HR to the 80s, <70% of target, with no ischemic EKG changes. APBs in receovery. Negative sxs for angina. Nuclear imaging revealed LVEF 51%, septal/inf wall and apical hypokineais with large mixed, primarily ischemic septal defect extending into the anterior wall. There was a mod/large inferior mixed, primaritly ischemic defect extending into a portion of the lateral wall with apical ischemia. There was a suggestion of LV dilation. ROS negative for fevers or chills.  Positive for cough and sputum which is present more when he drinks. He has had dysuria since having the foley catheter at the OSH. Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of current chest pain. He does have dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, ankle edema. Denies palpitations. 
65 y/o female s/p Aortic Valve Replacement (mechanical) on [**2836-3-6**] who been followed by routine echo's who has noticed decreased exercise tolerance with dyspnea on exertion. Along with chest tightness with exertion over the past 6 months. Also had an episode of CHF with hospital admission in [**9-12**] and following caridac cath in [**3-13**]. Most recent echo revealed severe prosthetic valve AS. Cath confirmed AS and revealed a dilated Ascending aorta. CT was then done and showed a 4.9 x 5.3cm ascending aorta.  She presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-7**] for anticoagulation with heparin, after holding her coumadin, for a planned AVR and ascending aortic replacement on [**5-10**]. 
The patient is an 85yo male with a h/o CHF, CAD s/p CABGx2, severe MR, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and CKD, who was tranfered to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital6 16810**] in the setting of CHF exacerbation and acute on chronic kidney disease for possible hemodialysis. The patient was briefly admitted to NVMC from [**Date range (1) 28486**] for chest pain, then readmitted after presenting again on [**2545-6-26**]. At time of second admission, he c/o intermittent sharp left arm pain, blurred vision in his right eye, and a fall at his home. In ED he was found to be hypotensive with SBP in the 70s.  He was given 3 boluses of 250mL NS, without effect.  He was started on dopamine in the ED, but developed chest pain and the dopamine was stopped.  He was then admitted to the ICU for further management. He was noted to have Cr of 3.24, elevated above his baseline (1.3-1.4 per notes). Other notable labs included a troponin of 0.1 on admission [**2545-6-26**], which peaked at 0.31 on [**2545-6-27**] and had decreased to 0.27 on [**2545-6-28**]. During that admission he was seen by nephrology and cardiology, and was initially felt to be volume depleted.  His Lasix and Cozaar were held, and he was gently hydrated with IVF, including a bicarb drip. His Cr trended down to 2.16 on [**2545-6-28**], and his BP was up to the 90s.  However he then developed worsening CHF, with CXR demonstrating worsening pulmonary vascular congestion and an enlarging left-sided pleural effusion.  An echo revealed normal LVEF (58%), severe MR, and moderate pulmonary HTN (pulmonary artery systolic pressure in mid-50s).  Of note, the patient had a cardiac cath done about one month prior, which revealed severe diffuse left main disease with 75% ostial and 95% proximal LAD lesions, as well as diffuse disease and distal occlusion of native RCA. Plan was for medical management. . On [**2545-6-30**] patient was noted to have decreasing urine output, as well as rising Cr. He did not respond to a bolus of IV Lasix, was started on a Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr, and his Lasix had to be titrated up to 20mg/hr.  His BUN/Cr continued to rise, his sodium levels were decreasing, and he developed nausea and vomiting suggestive of uremic symptoms.  Given his worsening renal function, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible hemodialysis. Prior to transfer, he was started on a dobutamine drip. . On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU patient was placed on monitoring and resumed on a dobutamine drip and furosemide drip. His dobutamine drip was shortly stopped as his BPs were stable, and his Lasix drip has been titrated down to 5mg/hr.  He was initially admitted to the MICU, then transferred to the CCU for management of his CHF.  Since admission to [**Hospital1 18**], he has been diuresing well, with a net fluid balance of negative 2.26 liters. His BP remains stable off pressors. He has still been hypoxic, requiring a high-flow oxygen face mask with FiO2 of 100% to maintain O2 sats in the mid-90s. Renal is following, and felt the [**Initials (NamePattern4) 225**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] may be secondary to cardiorenal physiology. . On admission to the CCU, the patient c/o SOB and lightheadedness, but denies any CP, abdominal pain, N/V/D, constipation, arthralgias, or myalgias. No recent fever or chills.  All other review of systems negative, although the patient does not provide much history on questioning.  Prior to his recent hospitalizations, he had been living alone. He reports he was able to climb stairs, but would develop some dyspnea on exertion. He denies orthopnea or PND. He does report leg pain on walking, although he cannot fully describe the quality of the pain.  He has bilateral lower extremity edema at baseline, per his previous reports. He denies any episodes of syncope. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 2484**] is an 85 year old gentleman discharged from the CCU service yesterday, returning with 2 episodes of painless hematochezia, approximately 500mL while defecating at his nursing home.  He was found to have continued bleeding/BRBPR and sent over to [**Hospital3 7481**]hospital.  He was transfused 1 unit of blood and 1.5 L with IVs placed and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. . In the ED, initial vs were: 88 86/54. Patient was given another 2 units of blood, 1.5L of NS to achieve hemodynamic stability. Surgery and GI were consulted, 40 of Protonix was started.  NG tube placed coffee ground on initial suction with 2 lavages negative thereafter.  Difficult with sat monitoring, but high 90s on NRB.  Given 40 Protonix x2. R Triple lumen placed.

58 year old woman with cryptogenic cirrhosis, followed by Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2896**] [**Name (STitle) 689**], admitted on [**11-5**] with lower GI bleeding, fever and hypotension. MICU course was complicated by intubation from [**11-6**] to [**11-20**], bouts of hypotension and oliguria in the setting of profuse bleeding requiring a total of 7U PRBC and 16U FFP. Source of bleeding was identified as 1) Rectal varices and 2) Vaginal bleeding, felt to be in setting of flexiseal and very elevated INR. . Patient has undergone extensive workup for liver transplantation, given her very elevated MELD score (32 today). Patient is being transferred to our service for further treatment of liver decompensation and transplant evaluation. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 22466**] is an 81 year old Spanish speaking male who was recently diagnosed with pulmonary embolus in [**3354-1-20**] and has been anticoagulated with Warfarin. Since that time, he has continued to complain of pleuritic chest pain. On the day of admission, the patients VNA found him diaphoretic and complaining of chest pain, which was exacerbated by exertion. The chest pain was substernal and did not radiate. EMS was notified. At time of EMS arrival, his systolic blood pressure was in the 80's. He received Aspirin and 250 cc of normal saline. While in the EW, he continued to complain of chest pain. EKG was remarkable for diffuse anterolateral ST depressions and T wave inversions. He was started on intravenous Heparin and Integrilin while being loaded with Plavix. Cardiac enzymes were elevated: CK 703, MB 65, Troponin 0.59. An echocardiogram revealed severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum and extensive apical akinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function was moderately to severely depressed with an ejection fraction of 30%. Cardiology activated the cath lab but Mr. [**Known patient lastname 22466**] initially refused. He was therefore admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 120**] 2 for further medical management and evaluation. 
82 year old with paroxysmal afib, h/o superior mesenteric vein thrombosis on coumadin since [**2936**], chronic renal insufficiency (baseline Cr 1.2-1.3) and MM diagnosed in [**2937**], on Revlimid therapy (last dose 1 week ago) recently diagnosed UTI on Cipro, awoke this morning with new weakness, SOB and malaise. Revlimid has been held since [**6-16**]. On Tues. [**6-16**] pt. experienced dysuria, dribbling stream and difficulty urinating. Was seen at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 1421**], UA was done and per pt. was dx with UTI and given Cipro. He states his symptoms are slightly improved since last week but that he has continued to have difficulty urinating. His wife states that over the course of the week he was intermittently confused, at one point getting lost on his way from the bathroom, though patient denies this. On the day prior to admission the patient developed a productive cough and shortness of breath. He does not produce frank sputum and denies hemoptysis. States that his appetite has been decreased over the past week or so. Denies any fevers or chills, nausea, vomiting, changes in ostomy output or sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] does endorse increased weakness. He ambulates with a walker at baseline but on the day of admission was unable to ambulate without assistance so he presented to the ED. In the ED, febrile to 101.6. BP 110/82 P 88 RR 22 91%RA. Started on levaquin and vanco and also received duonebs for wheeze. CXR concerning for multifocal pneumonia. Patient could not provide urine sample. Blood cultures were sent and patient was started on levofloxacin and vancomycin for PNA vs. UTI. Patient was originally requested for medicine floor bed, but he dropped his pressures into 80/40's with increased sluggishness and O2 desaturation to 88%. He was responsive to 2L NS and supplemental O2. On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS: T 96.2 P 83 BP 82/55, RR 21 91% 2LNC 
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with PMH significant for HTN, atrial fib on coumadin, and CHF (EF 20%) admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] on [**8-23**] with a Hct of 20. Pt was in her normal state of health until four days prior to admission when her ear began bleeding after she cleaned it with a Qtip. Pt denies pain or decrease in hearing from this ear. She presented to the ED on [**8-23**] for evaluation of the continued bleeding. In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to have a Hct of 20--- it was 33.5 on [**2515-6-29**]. Rectal exam showed melena. NG lavage was negative showeing clear fluid and no bile. Pt denied any abdominal pain. Pt's INR was 3.3 and she was given vit K 1 mg, 2U FFP, and 1U PRBC. Her post-transfusion Hct was 22. Pt then had an EGD which showed normal mucosa in the stomach, possible gastric inlet patch 17 cm from incisors, 20 mm in diameter, erythematous and not friable (unlikely to have caused her bleeding), normal mucosa in the duodenum and spots in the stomach. After EGD, pt desatted and became tachycardic to the 170s. She responded well to a NRB and lasix. In further discussion, pt had noted two "purple colored" stools prior to admission and several maroon colored stools. She also noted feeling week and fatigued. She has felt lightheaded for approximately six months. Pt has had a significant weight loss over the past few months from 130 to 90 pounds. She notes a decrease in her appetite and intrest in activities since her husband's death last year. 
The patient is a 44-year-old male with end stage renal insufficiency and diabetes who was on hemodialysis for four years and last dialysis was two days prior to admission.  The patient denied nausea, vomiting and 
This is a 50-year-old female with diabetes, who has diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, who is legally blind, who was evaluated for a cadaveric renal transplant. 
The patient is an 86-year-oldgentleman with a twenty-year history of a right reducible groin hernia which over the last several years he has been unable to reduce. He presents to the Emergency Room with 24hours of "food poisoning", however, on examination he has a large incarcerated hernia and significant bowel distention. The patient is adamant about not undergoing surgery but agreed to a CAT scan to document whether obstruction was complete as suspected. CAT scan demonstrated completeobstruction. The family and internist became actively involved in discussions with the patient and the patient then agreed to exploratory laparotomy and repair of hernia. The patient preoperatively was evaluated by Cardiology and deemed at very high risk for cardiac problem perioperatively, given the history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and ventricular tachycardia. 
The patient is a 76-year-old male with past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presented to the [**Last Name (un) **] Intensive Care Unit on [**3184-8-15**] with rapid atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure.  His hospital course has been complicated by development of Enterobacter ventilator associated pneumonia as well as a history of right cerebral water stride strokes resulting in left sided hemiparesis as well as diminished cough and gag reflex.  The patient was extubated during his admission to the [**Doctor Last Name **] Intensive Care Unit and transferred to the General Medicine Floor on the [**Hospital Ward Name **] of [**Hospital1 69**]. However, on the floor he decompensated secondary to fever and respiratory failure and was admitted to the MICU service on the [**Hospital Ward Name **] with respiratory failure and enterococcal sepsis of unknown etiology. Again, this dictation is an addendum to two previous dictations on the same patient for this hospital admission. BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS ADDENDUM 1.  Respiratory failure. As noted previously the patient has underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with baseline O2 sats of 90% and is known to be a CO2 retainer. He underwent extubation on [**3184-9-14**].  However, he required reintubation on [**3184-9-15**] after failing secondary to inability to handle secretions.  Status post his cerebrovascular accident he has minimal cough and gag reflex.  Therefore he is unable to clear respiratory secretions.  At this time the family, namely his daughters were approached regarding tracheostomy placement.  It was felt that this would be in the patient's best medical interest to avoid prolonged intubation and the risks there entailed.  However, family would not consent to tracheostomy at that time.  The patient remained intubated from [**3184-9-15**] to [**3184-9-22**]. On [**3184-9-22**] he self-extubated.  Initially he did well.  However, he began to have difficulty with increased work of breathing and inability to clear his oropharyngeal and respiratory secretions.  He underwent bronchoscopy on [**3184-9-24**] to evaluate for mucous plugging.  Bronchoscopy showed moderate thick secretions above and below the vocal cords and a small amount of secretions in the left lower lobe.  These were suctioned.  Moderate airway erythema was noted at that time however, there are no major abnormalities of the airways. Despite bronchoscopy and secretion management, the patient had to undergo re-intubation on [**3184-9-28**] again secondary to increased work of breathing and inability to handle oral and respiratory secretions.  He then self-extubated again on [**3184-10-3**].  Again, he did well for several days demonstrating adequate oxygenation and ventilation.  However, once again he failed to be able to handle his secretions and was reintubated on [**3184-10-6**].  Ultimately the patient's guardian, daughter [**Name (NI) 16663**] [**Name (NI) 4077**], consented for tracheostomy placement. The patient underwent tracheostomy placement at bedside on [**3184-10-3**].  He tolerated this procedure well without any major complications. Throughout his hospital course, he was continued on an aggressive pulmonary regimen of chest physical therapy, Metered dose inhalers, and aggressive pulmonary toilet including q one to two hour suctioning.  The patient had been started on high dosed steroids earlier in his hospital course.  Steroid dose was tapered to the lowest dose necessary in light of his history of adrenal insufficiency. 2.  Sepsis.  The patient was treated for his first course of enterococcal sepsis with a total of five days of Gentamicin and two weeks of Ampicillin therapy.  A transthoracic was performed and was negative for any vegetations or endocarditis.  At that time the patient would not consent for transesophageal echo.  As the transthoracic echo was negative a two week course of Ampicillin was approved by the Infectious Disease Service.  The patient's blood cultures were negative with several surveillance cultures.  However, on [**3184-9-29**] the patient spiked a temperature and was recultured.  At that time 3/4 bottles grew enterococcus, Ampicillin sensitive, high level Gentamicin resistant.  At that time the patient's pre-existing central venous line was pulled.  Catheter tip was cultured and was negative.  The patient was restarted on Ampicillin at 2 grams intravenous q 4 hours.  Multiple sepsis surveillance cultures were sent and were consistently negative.  In light of the patient's failure of previous Ampicillin therapy via the two week course, decision was made to treat the patient with a total 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 56 year-old man with a history of kidney transplant x 2, DM, bilateral BKA with RLE non-healing ulcer (right BKA in [**2711-5-18**]), who presents from rehab with AMS. Of note, he was recently discharged on [**2711-6-10**] after being admitted with a CHF exacerbation; at that time, he also had a wound VAC placed on his right stump and was treated with two weeks of vancomycin for an enterococcus wound infection. He was doing well at his nursing home until the day prior to admission when he was noted to have worsening mental status. He was also found to have a UTI and was started on imipenem. On the day of admission, he was found standing next to his bed on his stumps and was combative and noncooperative with nursing home staff, pulling out both his PICC and foley. He was then transferred to the ED for further evaulation. . In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.2 P 51 BP 141/83 R 18 O2 97%ra sat. He was given vancomycin and zosyn, later spiked a temperature to 102.9 rectal which resolved with PR tylenol, and was placed in wrist restraints for combativeness. His right BKA was draining purulent material and vascular was consulted, with a recommendation to start broad spectrum antibiotics. He was also noted to have diarrhea and an abdominal CT was performed to rule out colitis or an abdominal process, with an initial read that was negative. Because of his history of VRE, he was also given linezolid and then ceftriaxone 2g/acyclovir 50 mg x 1 to cover for meningitis. An LP was attempted (3 passes) but was unsuccessful. He was admitted to the MICU because of his severe agitation and concern that he would fail management on the floor. . On the floor, he was agitated but intermittently cooperative with interview and exam.

80 yo male with history of COPD on home oxygen, lung Cancer with recent admission to [**Hospital1 **] [**1-26**] - [**2-2**] for recurrent LLL PNA with effusion, treated for H. Flu PNA at the VA in [**12-8**] and had been at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 20796**] Rehab for 2 days and today developed shortness of breath, decreased oxygen saturation to 80% and RLQ pain, taken to [**Location (un) 24027**] ED and then transferred to [**Hospital1 **]. In the ED, the patient was in moderate respiratory distress, 80% room air oxygen saturation and was put on NRB with sats of 100%, ABG on NRB was 7.24/87/139 and had RLQ fullness. The patient's repeat gas was 7.29/74/50 and he was placed on 100% O2. He was initally felt to have pulmonary edema and given 60mg Lasix IV prior to arrival and placed on a nitro drip for 1 hour which was stopped after his pressure decreased. The patient was placed on Bipap 3 hours after arrival however still had a PaO2 of 50. He was then intubated for continued hypoxima. CT abd showed large rectus sheath hematoma but not dissection or retroperitoneal bleeding. He was given Levofloxacin and Flagyl for concern for PNA and morphine for pain. He was also gien 2 mg Ativan, 100mcg of Fentanyl, and Solumedrol 80mg.

The patient is a 44 year old male with end stage renal disease, status post living related renal transplant which had failed in the past, presenting for cadaveric renal transplantation.  The patient reports excellent health until the age of 17 when he developed appendicitis with rupture and incidental finding of nephrotic syndrome, treated medically with Prednisone and managed chronic renal insufficiency until end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis at age 32.  He was on hemodialysis times twelve months until receiving renal transplant from brother, 100 percent match.  Graft lasted four years and resumed hemodialysis for the past five years until the patient was now able to have a cadaveric renal transplant. 
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 27457**] is an unfortunate 84 year old female with a history diabetes mellitus, polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], prior transient ischemic attacks, bilateral carotid artery stenosis measured at 40 and 60% by ultrasound and carotid Duplex studies; history of hypertension, history of deep venous thrombosis, recurrent pulmonary embolism, and renal insufficiency, who was admitted to the Vascular Service after complaining of a several months history, approximately four to five months, of claudication and rest pain.  She had a right foot toe ulceration.  She was noted to have Doppler-able dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial on the right lower extremity.  She had a right femoral angiogram which showed an occluded SFA and occluded dorsalis pedis.  Given this finding, the patient was admitted and optimized for surgery. HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ultimately, after being evaluated by Cardiology and being cleared and being followed by the Diabetes Service of [**Last Name (un) **], the patient did go to the Operating Room by [**3118-7-18**], where she underwent a right common femoral artery to above the knee popliteal graft using PTFE and composite to the AT with non-reversed saphenous vein graft done with angioscopy and valve lysis.  The patient had a 200 cc blood loss.  There were no complications.  She got transfused a unit of packed cells interoperatively and received 3500 cc of Crystalloid, and underwent ............ and ................ with a PTFE, composite graft.  She left the Operating Room in stable condition. Over the next several days, the patient had complications of postoperative renal failure and mental status changes.  Renal consultation was obtained.  Their impression was she had a cardiac event complicated with low cardiac output versus sepsis as the likely potentiator of this persistent oliguria and renal failure.  The patient was accordingly supported in the VICU as well as the SICU intermittently as she did go between both of these care units. By [**7-29**], which would be postoperative day number 11 from her operation, the renal attending that was consulting on the case, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1298**], felt that the patient was probably pre-renal secondary to worsening cor pulmonale, and recommended to attempt to diurese the patient.  Her albumin at this time was 2.5. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1298**] did suggest to check troponin I for a question of a cardiac event, as covered in the perioperative period to precipitate this, to check for a fractional excretion of urea to see if this was consistent with a prerenal state, continue the diuretics, maintain blood pressure greater than 120 for renal perfusion, and to start optimizing her nutrition.  A Neurology consultation was obtained at this time also for her altered mental status.  At that time, Neurology's impression was that this was just an 84 year old woman with a prior polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], prior transient ischemic attacks, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, who was noted to have difficulty speaking after right femoral to AT bypass graft using composite PTFV and non-reversed saphenous vein. Her neurologic examination was significant for inattention and somewhat lethargic, which might reflex a metabolic encephalopathy.  Their recommendations were to check a head CT scan to evaluate a large stroke or bleed.  Also, to check an MRI and diffusion wave images in an MRA.  Would defer if her staples are an issue.  Consider to stop her subcutaneously heparin since her INR was therapeutic. Recheck urinalysis since the leukocyte esterase was also positive and to continue support as needed. By postoperative day number 12, she continued on diuresis. Neurologically, a head CT scan was achieved that showed no evidence of large intracranial bleed.  Cardiac-wise she had good ejection fraction.  The rest of her electrolytes were stable.  GI:  She was tolerating tube feeds to goal. Infectious Disease:  She had an increasing white count.  She was being diuresed with Lasix and Zaroxolyn.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1298**] was continued for her low urine output management. Again the mental status changes were persistent.  There was some question of a new cerebrovascular accident event despite some negative imaging.  She was noted to have an orbital bruit which was questionable of siphon stenosis.  A PA catheter was thereafter changed to a CVL. A consultation with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2120**], was obtained for assistance in her mental status issue.  He was really unable to shed much new light.  Ultimately over the next several days, the patient's clinical status deteriorated.  Neurology 
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with an idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (possibly from myocarditis persumed viral >10 years ago) with LVEF of 20% (non-ischemic), moderate mitral regurgitation (improved on recent echo), BiV ICD, admitted to CCU after attempted ablation of arrythmogenic focus performed due to recent ICD discharges [**Month (only) **]. . Prior to [**Month (only) 354**] she felt months of increased dypsnea, weakness, exhaustion and had deteriorated to NYHFC Class III despite not being fluid overloaded. ICD fired [**9-10**] and [**9-13**]. Amiodarone was increased from 200mg [**Hospital1 **] to TID late [**Month (only) **]. At the visit the end of [**Month (only) 354**] noted mild edema in her ankles, no difference in symptoms, no orthopnea or PND. No CP or palpitations but described episodes lightheadedness and feeling faint that passed 20-30 seconds later at which point her ICD fired. She was 162 lbs at that point. . In the cardiac catheterization lab had endocardial and epicardial access searching for source, none found, pt briefly hypotensive (induced to vtach and would become hypotensive) and admitted to CCU on dopamine @ 2mcg/kg/min for monitoring for possible pericardial effusion. Sheaths are out and pt extubated prior to arrival. Pulsus by doppler at bedside negative (115->113), informal bedside TTE showing no evidence of pericardial effusion. Pacer is set at DDV 60, biV paced. . On review of systems, she describes chest pain at the site of her recent epicardial approach but is otherwise negative. 
67 y/o female with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (possibly from myocarditis presumed viral >10 years ago) with LVEF of 20% (non-ischemic), moderate mitral regurgitation (improved on recent echo), BiV ICD, who was admitted to CCU in late [**Month (only) 354**] for VT ablation following ICD discharges in [**Month (only) **]. During the procedure, it was found that she has multiple inducible VT's arising from septum, lateral wall and apex. Ablation attempt not performed given septal origin of VT. She was discharged home on Mexiletine rather than Amiodarone. Following that discharge, she continued to have frequent sustained VT, and was subsequently readmitted [**10-30**] with more symptomatic VT which was paced and not shocked. During that admission, she had an EP study and attempted VT ablation at the anterior septal aspect of the subaortic valve region. Carvedilol and Mexiletine were held prior to the procedure. She was then started on Metoprolol and titrated up to Metoprolol XL 50 mg PO BID. She was observed off Mexiletine without further significant episodes and discharged home on [**3273-11-2**]. . This morning she was walking from her bathroom and felt palpitations with associated lightheadedness for approximately 30 seconds. Her ICD subsequently fired and then fired again 30 seconds later. Her palpitations resolved She was observed while she was off the mexiletine with no significant episodes and sent home [**3273-11-2**]. This AM, she was walking from her bathroom and felt palpitations and lightheadedness for approximately 30 seconds. Her ICD fired, and then fired again 30 seconds later. After the second shock, she was no longer sympatomatic from her palps. She denied chest pain/pressure, SOB, nausea during this episode. . She was instructed to present to [**Hospital1 18**]. Upon arrival, EP interrogated the device which showed VT at a rate of ~120 BPM, which was attempted to be broken by ATP twice and ultimately shocked twice with escalating joules. On arrival to the floor, she initially felt well without any palpitations or lightheadedness. She subsequently developed VT to 110s-120s. She then received Ativan 1 mg IV and Lidocaine 100 mg IV once at 1400 with subsequent resolution of her VT. At 1755 she again went into VT and recevied Metoprolol 5 m IV once and an additional 50 mg IV Lidocaine. This episode resolved as well but 40 minutes later she again went into VT and received Fentanyl 25 mg IV and Metoprolol 5 mg IV. The VT again resolved but the patient was transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring. . Upon arrival to the CCU, the patient was calm and was no longer in VT. She felt well only reporting a fluttering in her chest when in VT. 
The patient is a 67 year old female with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (? viral myocarditis 10 years ago) with LVEF of 20% s/p BiV ICD, and recurrent multifocal ventricular tachycardia s/p L VATS for sympathectomy and excision of the left stellate Ganglion on [**3273-12-4**] in setting of recurrent VT who presents from home with multiple ICD shocks. Since returning home, she has felt well. She has noted intermittent palpitations since yesterday. . The patient has had a long course of admissions since [**Month (only) 354**] [**3272**] for recurrent multifocal ventricular tachycardia and ICD firings. She was found to have multiple inducible VTs arising from the septum, lateral wall and apex during EP study in [**Month (only) 354**], with the septal origin of VT precluded ablation. She was started on mexilitine but continued to have frequent sustained VT. Anterior septal ablation was attempted, but she experienced recurrent VT. She was readmitted and had successful stellate ganglion block and was started on qunidine. About one week later, she had recurrent palpitations and was re-admitted for repeat stellate ganglion block twice.  During her most recent admission, she was taken to the operating room with Thoracic Surgery on [**3273-12-4**] and had a left-sided video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure with sympathectomy without issue and was in sinus rhythm afterwards. She was discharged on metoprolol but not any anti-arrhythmics.  The patient had been feeling very well until yesterday, when she began to note some palpitations. She was having dinner with her family and felt palpitations and experienced one shock, followed in succession by approximately 3 more shocks. Her husband called Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and he advised admission to the CCU. . In the CCU, she has no complaints. Interrogation of her ICD reveals 20 episodes of VT since [**3273-12-7**], mostly with rate in 110-130s range. . On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. 
62 year old male with a pmh of ESRD s/p failed graft on HD, Hep C genotype 1, DMII, HTN, HLD who presents from an OSH with pericarditis complicated by pericardial effusion. . His OSH course is as follows: He had an admission prior to this [**Date range (1) 27482**] with pleuritic CP and rub, diagnosed with pericarditis. Also, new LBBB and tropI of 0.125. Echo showed small effusion and normal wall motion, mild AS, mild MR, unchanged from baseline. He was treated with NSAIDs. Due to LBBB, prolonged PR and underlying dCHF (between dialysis sessions) his dilt was stopped and coreg (3.125) was added. He was discharged on 50mg TID of indocin. . Several days after discharge he developed general weakness, vague diffuse low abd pain, and fatigue. Dialysis was complicated by hypotension (new) and required fluid. [**8-18**] admitted to OSH with hypotension of 75/50 and above symptoms. He was fluid resuscitated, fluid responsive. CT A/P showed diverticulosis (no inflammation) and a mod pericardial effusion (incidental). RUQ U/S with GB wall thickening, otherwise unremarkable. . He was admitted to the ICU, BPs maintained 100s-140s and HRs 50s-70s. Treated presumptively for adrenal insufficiency with hydrocortisone. Echo showed circuferential pericardial effusion (2.1-2.2 cm) reportedly without evidence of tamponade.  His vitals remained stable and his labs were unremarkable (stable anemia HCT ~30) and WBC elevation of 19 after steroids. Creatinine 8.9, sodium 131.  He was transferred from OSH ([**Hospital1 1543**]) to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. . At [**Hospital1 18**], he was admitted to inpatient medicine.  He is comfortable without any acute complaints. He does still have mild chest discomfort that has persisted throughout his admission at the OSH. He also has vague lower abdominal pain, but is otherwise without any acute complaints. No SOB, no orthopnea, no PND. 
The patient is a 69 year old male with multiple medical problems including coronary artery disease, status post several SNTEMIs, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15 percent, end stage renal disease on hemodialysis Monday, Wednesday and Friday, hypertension, dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  The patient was in his usual state of health until the morning prior to admission when he awoke with acute onset of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea as well as some incontinence of stool. The morning of admission the patient woke up with shortness of breath and was diaphoretic and had chest pain.  He presented to [**Hospital3 4463**] Hospital and was found to have a CK of 1773 and troponin I of 62.95 and a potassium of 6.1. He was treated with four Baby Aspirin and was started on Nitroglycerin drip, was given 80 mg of intravenous Lasix, 10 units of intravenous insulin, one amp of D50, Calcium Gluconate, Aggrastat and then became chest pain free.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for emergent cardiac catheterization.  This showed a 60 to 70 percent left main stenosis, left anterior descending coronary artery with a widely patent stent, and in the midvessel, there was 40 percent stenosis.  The left circumflex had a 50 to 60 percent stenosis at the origin and a previously placed right coronary artery stent was widely patent.  There was a totally occluded posterolateral branch and moderate pulmonary hypertension.  Hemodynamics revealed a pulmonary artery pressure of 49/28, cardiac output of 2.1 with an index of 1.3, SVR 2667 and pulmonary artery saturation of 39 percent. No culprit lesion was identified. 
This is an 80 year-old white male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, hypertension, myocardial infarction times three with recent stent placement, congestive heart failure (with a recent admission), ICD placed (complicated by ventricular tachycardia), end stage renal disease secondary to FSGS on hemodialysis three times a week, prostate cancer, hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia who was initially transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] from an outside hospital with pleuritic chest pain that was not relieved with nitroglycerin, but was relieved with Toradol. His first set of cardiac enzymes at the outside hospital were negative.  The patient had a recent admissions for congestive heart failure the first being secondary to ICD firing and stent restenosis status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and hemodialysis and the second being for flash pulmonary edema on [**9-6**] and cardiac catheterization was negative for new lesion at that time.  At the outside hospital the patient received aspirin, nitroglycerin, intravenous Toradol and gastrointestinal prophylaxis.  The patient complained of mild nausea.  She denies abdominal pain, fevers, chills, calf pain, shortness of breath, diarrhea, diaphoresis. 
84 yo male with hx of ischemic CM, polymorphic VT s/p ICD, ESRD who presents after AICD firing. Pt reports not feeling well for the past month with decreased energy but no chest pain, chest tightness or increasing SOB. He has lost [**1-10**] lbs and has decreased appetite with dysphagia, and his meals consist almost entirely of oatmeal. He awoke today in his USOH and went to dialysis which he tolerated well. While waiting for his daughter to pick him up he felt a sudden flushing feeling in his face but no chest pain, tightness or palpitations. This resolved spontaneously. Then while sitting at home watching TV he felt presyncopal with the same warm feeling and then woke up to his ICD firing. He was found by his daughter slumped in his chair but was alert by the time she questioned him. She called EMS and he felt well until arrival of EMS. While on the ride to the hospital he again felt the "warm feeling" and the ICD fired twice in the ambulance. This recurred twice in the ED at [**Hospital3 2739**]. Labs revealed a potassium of 2.4 so he was given 10 mEq of IV potassium and 20meq PO and he was started on a Lidocaine gtt at 2mg/min after an initial bolus of 50mg. Plan was then made for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. 
Patient is a 84 yo male with h/o HTN, CAD s/p stents LAD, diagonal and OM1, ESRD on HD, and ICD for recurrent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, history of probable amiodarone-induced lung toxicity admitted with firing of his ICD. Symptoms started at HD where he had nausea and several episodes of vomiting. He then felt that he was going to be shocked and was shocked 10+ times. He reports that this has happened before when his electrolytes were off. He was sent to the ED where he was given calcium gluconate 2 g x1, magnesium 2g x1 and was seen by the EP service whow started amiodarone drip as well as lidocaine 50 mg IV x1. Per ED resident, he had 2 further shocks while in the ED, therefore he was transfer to the CCU. He remained HD stable and AA0x3. . On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis (he did have a superficial spahenous clot), pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 76 year-old man with CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CKD, who p/w DOE and chest "burning" on exertion. For the last several weeks the patient has been complaining of increased fatigue. Prior to this the patient could walk about 1 walk, but now becomes dyspnic w/ minimal exertion. He has PND and 2 pillow orthopnea. No syncope, dizziness, URI symptoms. The patient also has right sided chest pain that is best described as a "burning" that starts in his back and radiates to his right chest. It is worse w/ exertion and relieved w/ nitro. His SOB is also relieved w/ rest and nitro. . Of note the patient was recently addmitted on [**9-/2590**] for CHF exacerbation and found to have new onset A. flutter. The patient was diuresed and put on coumadin. He had a GI bleed and was taken off of coumadin. He decided not to undergo GI evaluation because the GI bleed stopped and he could not tolerate the prep. 
The patient is a 58-year-old man who 7 years ago underwent repair of type A aortic dissection; however, it turned out to be a chronic dissection. The aneurysm was repaired, and the aortic valve was resuspended. He was lost to follow-up. He presented with congestive heart failure, moderate aortic insufficiency, ejection fraction of 30%, and severe 3-vessel coronary artery disease. He has elected to proceed with aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 67 year old male with a history of bladder cancer, status post bladder resection with ileal conduit in [**2591**] who has a history of nephrolithiasis and multiple urinary tract infections who now presents with fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting and a recent urine culture positive for gram negative rods.  The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital6 253**] in [**2619-6-27**] for an elective lithotripsy of a left renal stone which was complicated by Corynebacterium urosepsis for which he was treated with ten days of Vancomycin.  During that admission he also had multiple bilateral lower lobe pulmonary emboli and negative lower extremity noninvasive studies. The patient was in his usual state of health until four to five days prior to admission when he experienced fatigue and fevers to 102 degrees.  He presented to his primary care clinic and was started on Levofloxacin by his primary care physician on [**8-17**].  On [**8-18**], he developed severe left flank pain and was sent to the Emergency Department with a fever of 102.7 degrees.  Computerized axial tomography scan showed severe left hydronephrosis with gas requiring urgent decompression.  The patient was given one unit of fresh frozen plasma in order to correct his Coumadin-induced coagulopathy before his interventional radiology procedure, however, he developed a pruritic rash while receiving his fresh frozen plasma, so he only received one out of three proposed units.  At Interventional Radiology he had a temporary inferior vena cava filter placed through his right jugular and a left percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed as well under local anesthesia.  Immediately after the procedure, the patient desaturated to 66% oxygen saturation which then increased to the 90s of 100% FIO2 with a nonrebreather mask.  The patient was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.

Pt was at baseline when was found to have BRB in diaper in the afternoon on the day of admission. The bleeding was first noted at 16:30 and the patient soaked 4 diapers in the course of 1.5 hours. In triage in the ED 99.0 79 122/71 16 98% RA. Throughout ED time, patient was HD stable, HR 104-110 in a. fib, BP 119-140/49-88. Seen to have clots passing from rectum. Tried NG lavage in ED but not successful due to patient non-cooperation. Hct was stable at baseline of 32, INR 3.7. Patient received 5mg SC vitamin K and 1 unit FFP as well as pantoprazole 40mg IV. 
This is an 84 year old woman with CAD status post CABG, admitted recently to an outside hospital with what appeared to be worsening dyspnea on exertion.  She was admitted with unstable angina, complaining of chest pain at rest, dyspnea on exertion, nausea, vomiting. All these symptoms lasted about 24 hours.  She had a mild troponin leak at about 0.5 at the outside hospital.  Symptoms improved with sublingual nitroglycerin. She had an echo at the outside hospital which showed depressed LV function with EF of about 30% and new T wave and apex abnormalities.  She was started on a nesiritide drip, IV nitroglycerin and IV heparin.  Several days later she had a new syncopal episode and was found to be in junctional rhythm with ventricular response of about 70.  At the same time she had guaiac positive stools.  Therefore, IV heparin was discontinued and she was started on dobutamine.  She was also apparently transfused.  At that time her creatinine went up to 3.3 from a baseline of about 2.5.  She received Mucomyst and was transferred here for cardiac cath. Cardiac cath revealed left main coronary artery which appeared okay.  LAD had subtotal occlusion.  OM1 had 80% to 90% stenosis and was stented times two.  RCA was patent. LIMA to LAD was patent.  SVG graft was occluded. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 993**] is a 37 year old male with history of idiopathic pancreatitis who presents from [**Hospital 15207**] with necrotizing pancreatitis.  He initially presented on [**12-29**] with one day history of severe abdominal pain/LLQ pain/epigastric pain radiating to left scrotum.  Also with nausea and dry heaves but no emesis.  Went to ED for evaluation and found to have elevated amylase (424 --> 681) and lipase (1245 --> 1154).  CT scan of abdomen demonstrated significant necrotizing pancreatitis with significant abnormal pleural fluid.  Patient was hypotensive and was on dopamine intially but weaned off after recieving approximately 4L of IVF's over 2 days.  He also become tachycardic to 170's and was treated with lopressor 5mg IV, repeated an unclear number of times.  He also had a recurrent fever (Tm 105) and was hypoxia with O2 sats in low 90's on 6-8L high flow.  He was seen by gastroenterology and treated with aldactone 50 [**Hospital1 **] and lasix for ascites and to improve urine output.  He had been receiving dilaudid 2-4 mg IV Q2H prn for pain.  Because of the worsening CT scan on [**12-31**] and clinical deterioration, patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 27941**] is a 58 year old male with longstanding insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, hyperlipidemia and recently diagnosed pulmonary fibrosis and atrial flutter.  He was admitted on [**11-19**] with light headedness, weakness, hypotension and acute renal failure.  The patient was at [**Hospital6 1114**] on [**9-26**] to [**3476-10-22**].  Per [**Hospital1 1998**] discharge summary, he presented with right sided pleuritic chest pain and abnormal chest x-ray at the PCP's office. CT angiogram was done which was negative for pulmonary embolism but had a mass at the right base with pleural plaques and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. Bronchoscopy with brushings was done, complicated by significant bleeding requiring epinephrine injection.  CT scan was negative for malignancy. Mediastinoscopy was done with lymph node biopsy and pleural biopsy.  Chest tube was placed.  Final pathology was negative for malignancy but with "fibrous pleural lesions." The patient was diuresed with improvement in shortness of breath. Obstructive sleep apnea was diagnosed as well and bi-pap was initiated with increased oxygen saturations at night. Other issues at [**Hospital6 1114**] included acute renal failure, post CT angiogram; creatinine up to high 2's; renal function improved with aggressive intravenous fluids.  He also had knee pain, consistent with gout, treated with intra- articular steroids.  He developed a flutter with right ventricular rhythm and was treated with Coumadin and Verapamil.

This is a 75 year old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia who was admitted to an outside hospital on [**2511-12-25**] with respiratory distress. Reportedly, the patient had been short of breath at home for several days with productive cough, yellow sputum, and low- grade temperature.  The patient did not report any chest pain.  She did, however, report nausea and diarrhea just prior to admission, as well as worsening shortness of breath at home the night prior to admission.  Emergency Medical Services found her to be "cyanotic and mottled," and intubated her in the field.  In the outside hospital Emergency Room, the patient was repleted for presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare and received Solu-Medrol, Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers and Mucomyst nebulizers as well as Levofloxacin.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled and the patient ruled in for an myocardial infarction.  Her troponin was 4.14.  Initially, the patient received Lasix, but attributed hypotension upon receiving intravenous fluids was noted to have increased dyspnea.  She was treated with Lasix and Natrecor which 3 liters diuresis but reported chest pain and was transferred to [**Hospital6 253**] for cardiac catheterization. At the [**Hospital6 253**], the patient had coronary angiography which demonstrated 70 percent lesions in the left anterior descending coronary artery and a 95 percent focal mid lesion in the left circumflex coronary artery as well as 70 percent lesion in the right coronary artery.  The patient received stenting of the mid left circumflex coronary artery with 2.0 times 13 mm pixel bare-metal stent.  After the cardiac catheterization, the patient was extubated but because of respiratory distress, she could not tolerate BiPAP and was reintubated on [**2511-12-30**].  Echocardiogram on [**2511-12-30**], showed overall left ventricular systolic function severely depressed with anterior, apical, septal, inferior and lateral severe hypokinesis/akinesis.  Ejection fraction was less than 20 percent. 
63 yo male with multiple cardiac risk factor including CHF. He has had DOE and angina for 4-5 months. Had + ETT and this led to cath which revealed 3VD. Referred for surgery. 
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of refractory hypertension, PMR, temporal arteritis on chronic prednisone who has been complaining of dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath and orthopnea for many months.  Work up in [**Month (only) 944**] by essentially normal left ventricular ejection fraction.  The patient presented after having increasing shortness of breath.  Her husband called EMS 30 minutes after symptoms began.  EMS found patient very lethargic in obvious respiratory distress, unable to reply whether she was experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, headache or nausea/vomiting.  Vitals at that time showed a respiratory rate of 32.  The patient was taken to the [**Hospital6 1739**] Emergency Department and intubated with pulmonary edema.  The patient was then taken to catheterization and found to have severely compromised left ventricular function with apical dyskinesis and inferior hypokinesis.  O2 saturation was showed to have a significant stepup which was confirmed two times.  Her SVC saturation was 55.  Her PA saturation was 80 on first trial.  On second trial, SVC was 54 and PA saturation was 72%.  A transthoracic echocardiogram done in the lab at that time was unable to demonstrate a VFD.  Intervention was deferred at the time and the patient was sent to CCU for TEE.  Angiography at catheter lab demonstrated a diseased LAD with focal disease, but TIMI-3 flow.  When the patient presented to catheter lab, she was initially hypertensive with a blood pressure of 215/160, but precipitously dropped her blood pressure when nitroglycerin was started.  The patient responded rapidly to dopamine and patient came to the CCU receiving dopamine. PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION TO CCU:  The patient was on vent assisted control, tidal volume of 600, rate of 10, FIO2 of 100%, pressure support of 10 and PEEP of 5.  Her heart rate was 85, blood pressure 119/50, PAP 27/40, respiratory rate of 10, pulse oximetry 100%.  Temperature rectally was 101.2??????.

Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 23560**] is a 58 year old woman with a complicated prolonged hospital course who was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 194**] Service on [**2853-6-18**]. Originally, she was admitted on [**2853-5-29**], to the Vascular left below the knee amputation on [**6-6**].  Her postoperative course was complicated by suicidal ideations requiring a one-to-one sitter.  For a more detailed review of the patient's stay on the Vascular Service, please refer to the Discharge Summary from [**2853-6-11**]. The patient was subsequently transferred to Medical Intensive thought to be a combination of uremia secondary to acute on chronic renal failure and necrotic infection.  In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the EKG showed new inferior ST elevations and the patient subsequently ruled in for an acute myocardial infarction with peak CK of 369, MB of 23 and troponin of 38.5. Preoperative stress MIBI on [**6-2**], had shown moderate defects anteriorly, inferiorly, laterally and apically, with marked diffuse hypokinesis and ejection fraction of 20%.  Dialysis was initiated on [**6-13**] with continued improvement in mental status. The patient was initially treated conservatively for an myocardial infarction with heparin, beta blocker, aspirin, ACE inhibitor.  The patient was taken to the Catheterization Laboratory on [**2853-6-18**].  In the catheterization, the patient was discovered to have three-vessel disease and underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of Obtuse marginal 1 lesion with good results.

She is incontinent of urine/stool at baseline. . In the ED, VS T 101.8 HR 62 BP 111/26 RR 20 POx 98% on 2.5L NC. Patient remained lethargic, and was given 2 amps of D50 and D51/2NS . EKG was obtained without changes from baseline. CXR showed mild pulmonary edema. U/A concerning for UTI and she was given a dose of levofloxacin. Given her fever and MS, LP was considered but the patient's family refused so she was started on Vanc/Ceftriaxone for empiric therapy for meningitis. Blood and urine cultures were sent. In MICU, there was again concern for meningitis, but pt.'s family again refused LP so she was started on Vanc/Ceftriaxone empirically. Her glucoseincreased to 80 with multiple amps of D50. By 10:30pm, her gluocse stabilized. Insulin held overnight. She tolerated breakfast in the am and glucose rose into the 200s. Insulin restarted with sliding scale and she was transitioned to half of her home dose begun (NPH 7 in AM, 1 qpm).

The patient is a 52 year old male, transferred from [**Hospital3 3534**] after a 30 day stay for Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia secondary to infected pacer leads, complicated by a left ventricular thrombus and a left subclavian partial thrombus, ultimately causing septic pulmonary emboli.  The patient was transferred for definitive management and extraction of the pacer and reimplantation given his congenital heart block issues. 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 3967**] is a 88 year old female per OMR with CAD, AF, dCHF, DM2, DVT/PE [**2520**], end-colostomy [**2523**] for perforated diverticulitis, recurrent multi-drug resistant UTI who is admitted for UTI,hypotension and DVT. . Patient has previous hx of left femur fracture in [**2527-2-18**]. She has been living at nursing home since where she has remained farely immobile and spends most of her time in a wheelchair requiring full help in ADL's. At nursing home she was on prophylactic enoxaparin. . Patient's most recent admission at [**Hospital1 18**] was [**Date range (1) 13269**] for UTI. Urine cultures at the time however grew mixed flora and patient was treated based on her previous cultures of [**6-/2527**] which grew E.coli resistant to cipro, bactrim, Pseudomonas resistant to cephalosporin and VRE. She received daptomycin and meropenem and was discharged on meropenem and fosfomycin to rehab for completion of 10 day course.

The patient is a 59-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease (status post inferoposterolateral myocardial infarction in [**2768**]), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who was transferred from [**Hospital3 14979**] to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2772-6-30**] for a cardiac catheterization. In [**2768**], the patient's cardiac catheterization revealed an occluded right coronary artery and circumflex with moderate-to-diffuse disease along the left anterior descending artery. The patient currently has presented with increasing shortness of breath which awoke him from sleep; at which time the patient presented to [**Hospital3 14978**] on [**2772-6-27**].  During the presentation, the patient's BNT was elevated to 459, and the patient's Persantine thallium showed an inferolateral defect; at which time the patient was referred to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization. Cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 186**] showed 60% to 70% ostial left main, left anterior descending artery with 80% and 70% mid, left circumflex to mid, right coronary artery to mid, both collateralized from left.  Ejection fraction was in the high 40s.  There was the presence of mild mitral regurgitation and inferobasal and posterior akinesis.  Wedge was estimated to be approximately 17 mmHg.  No evidence of chest pain, and shortness of breath was substantially better after treatment with Bumex. At this time, the patient was evaluated by Cardiothoracic Surgery Service for a coronary artery bypass graft. 
[**Known patient firstname **] [**Known patient lastname 20613**] is a 69 yo female with a history of cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, diabetes and heart failure who is being transferred from OSH for management of suspected cholecystitis with gallstone in CBD, being transferred for emergent ERCP.  She was admitted to OSH on [**3059-4-6**] with abdominal pain, and quickly became hypotensive.  She underwent an ultrasound exam which showed thickened gallbladder wall and sludge and stones in the GB.  The surgical teams strongly suspected acute cholecystitis. The patient also had a recent HIDA scan which was suggestive of a distal common bile duct obstruction.  She was treated with levaquin and flagyl.  Blood cultures from OSH are NGTD. Cardiology consult at OSH did not feel that the patient having an acute MI.  Her anxiety and pain at OSH were difficult to manage requiring narcotics for pain control and one point required narcan for somnolence; she was also given presedex for pain.  She was treated with dobutamine and lasix gtt, but lasix was stopped due to hypotension. The patient was transferred from OSH on vasopressin and dobutamine.  On arrival,  her SBP was 60, HR 80 and patient was arousable, but not mentating well.  She was not oriented and unable to answer questions regarding history. Review of sytems: unable to obtain secondary to mental status. 
The patient is a 70-year-old gentleman with a history of cadaveric renal transplant in [**2767-5-23**], type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease (status post silent anteroseptal myocardial infarction with a most recent ejection fraction of 40%) who was recently admitted to the Surgery Service at [**Hospital1 69**] from [**8-17**] to [**2769-8-27**].  At this time, he was treated for diverticulitis and acute renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis.  He had been treated with ampicillin, Levaquin, and Flagyl and then discharged to rehabilitation. The patient presented to the Emergency Department on [**9-9**] from rehabilitation for decreased systolic blood pressures in the 80s to 90s with acute renal failure and electrocardiogram changes consistent with positive troponins. The patient had never complained of chest pain or shortness of breath.  Cardiology was curbsided.  Given that his presumed silent myocardial infarction had occurred about two weeks ago (on the 6th) there was no need for any immediate catheterization and no anticoagulation at this time. It was felt that his hypotension was not secondary to cardiogenic shock given his clinical examination with no pulmonary edema and timing of the events. While the patient was in the Emergency Department on this admission, the patient's systolic blood pressure ran in the 80s.  The patient was given two liters of intravenous fluids, two units of packed red blood cells, with systolic blood pressures responding to the 100s.  He was also given 125 mg of Solu-Medrol given the patient's history of prednisone for immunosuppression and thoughts of possible renal insufficiency. The patient had also been complaining of left lower quadrant pain.  An abdominal computed tomography was performed which showed worsening sigmoid diverticulitis.  The General Surgery team consulted at this time. 
The patient is a 70 year old male with a history significant for end stage renal disease secondary to diabetes mellitus, status post cadaveric renal transplant in [**2767-5-23**], hypertension, status post cerebrovascular accident, status post myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15 to 20% and diverticulitis who was admitted to [**Hospital6 1739**] with heart failure, myocardial infarction and renal failure on [**2769-9-9**]. The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and was medically managed. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is an obese older male in moderate respiratory distress on admission.  The patient was awake and following commands, neurologically intact.  The patient had bilateral crackles on lung examination.  Cardiac examination was regular rate and rhythm without murmur or gallop.  The abdomen was obese with a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.  Lower extremities were cool with palpable distal pulses. LABORATORY DATA:  Chest x-ray was significant for pulmonary edema with pleural effusion.  Electrocardiogram was significant for sinus rhythm with inferior Q waves. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was medically managed in the Intensive Care Unit with a prolonged course of renal failure and congestive heart failure.  The patient then developed worsening of diverticular disease with significant diverticulitis requiring a sigmoid colectomy on [**2769-10-14**].  Postoperatively the patient was transferred to the Transplant Surgery Service.  The patient was intubated in respiratory failure with acute renal failure and required aggressive diuresis with Natrecor as well as inotropic support with Dobutamine.  Over the course of the next three weeks, the patient had recovering renal function from acute renal failure and was aggressively diuresed.  Significant infections included Enterobacter central line infection as well as Enterobacter pneumonia.  The patient was treated with Meropenem and will be complete a course of three weeks.  The patient was also empirically treated for Clostridium difficile colitis with a course of Flagyl for ten days. During the postoperative period a tracheostomy was placed and the patient was weaned from the ventilator.  The patient continued to improve with an improvement in mental status. The patient was awake and following commands and pulmonary function, to be off the ventilator on a tracheostomy collar. The patient's creatinine normalized to a level of 0.9.  The patient's gastrointestinal tract recovered and the patient was tolerating tube feeds at goal.  The patient was afebrile with a normal white count by the end of the hospital stay.

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure. A chest x-ray done in the Emergency Department subsequently revealed a left lower lobe pneumonia.  Meanwhile, the patient had an episode of hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s despite a 500-cc intravenous fluid bolus. Dopamine was started briefly until approximately 2 liters to 3 liters of normal saline was infused with a systolic blood pressure increasing to 95.  The patient was on initial intravenous antibiotics of ceftriaxone and azithromycin along with nebulizers. 
This is a 75 year old white female with a past medical history significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension and peripheral vascular disease, who now presents with acute anterior myocardial infarction. The patient presented to her primary care physician yesterday complaining of mild aches between her breasts and dyspnea on exertion.  EKG at that time revealed new onset atrial fibrillation and the patient was sent home with instructions for follow-up with Cardiology today. She presented to [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department at 5 a.m. today with acute respiratory distress with tachypnea to the 30s, decreased blood pressure, diaphoresis and chest pain.  EKG with ST elevations in the anterior leads.  She was soon intubated and taken emergently to the Catheterization Laboratory. There, she was found to have a total occlusion of the mid- left anterior descending, subtotal mid occlusion of the left circumflex, and 95% mid right coronary artery with cardiogenic shock.  Three stents were placed and the patient was started on a dopamine drip secondary to decreased blood pressure.

This is a 66yo man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation on dabigatran, diabetes mellitus (history of poor glycemic control), tobacco abuse, hyperlipidemia, alcohol abuse and prior stroke who presents to the ED by EMS today after a change in his mental status. We are able to obtain limited a history by a combination of sources including the patient's daughter, EMS personnel. The patient has been in his USOH. He is retired and lives at home, and is unmarried. His kids visit him from time to time. His daughter reports that he drinks alcoholic beverages everyday and is an active smoker. Apparently, he had been complaining about asthma symptoms more recently. They spoke with him this morning around 11AM. Later in the afternoon, around 4PM, his son visited with him and they spent some time together, and had a couple of beers for Father's day. After returning from the bathroom, he had a sudden change in his mental status. All of a sudden, he started to scream and complain of difficulty breathing. He seemed confused. EMS was called, and transported him to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Initial ED physical examinations were concerning for a toxic metabolic encephalopathy, and routine bloods were largely unrevealing. He appeared confused and disoriented and was not able to provide any type of a coherent history. Language was not the problem here: his knowledge of English was quite reasonable. Later, it was noticed that he was having difficulty seeing. Neurology was called. A complete review of systems was above, a more thorough ROS was not able to be obtained 
73 yo M with estensive past hx of CAD with multiple interventions as outlined below, renal insufficiency who presented to [**Hospital 1456**] Hospital on [**2-19**] c/o 4 days of progressive angina with exertion, characterized as crushing chest pain, worse than his usual angina sx's, associated with increased DOE. At [**Hospital1 1456**], troponin peak was 0.5, rise in BUN and Cr to 101 and 2.9 respectively. Persantine MIBI on [**2-22**] was performed showing no reversible ischemia. Also on [**2-22**] he developed new onset A. Fib with relative hypotension, was cardioverted, developed subsequent bradycardia with junctional rhythm in the 30's, required temporary transcutaneous pacing and was hypotensive to 60s systolic, started on dopamine, and converted to sinus rhythm in the 80s and improved of BP to 130s/80s. While in recovery from the propofol anesthesia he reportedly developed SVT in the 120s, controlled with cardizem and started on amiodarone drip. On [**2-23**] in the afternoon, pt went into junctional rhythm in the 50's, given atropine x1. He subsequently developed chest pain, given SL NTG x 3, no MSO4 given. New ST depressions and T wave inversions noted. Started on heparin drip with some groin bleeding and hematuria. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab. Here, CO 2.84, CI 1.36, PCwp 48, RA 34, AO 92/48/58, PA 80/32/48, RV 80/23/36. Angio showed occluded LMCA, LIMA to LAD patent, RCA occluded, SCG-OM2 patent with 40% restenosis, SCG-OM1 and SVG-PDA occluded, no angio intervetion performed, started on dobutamine drip, nitro drip, given 100mg lasix IV. 
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with PMH of tachy-brady syndrome, mitral regurgitation, and CML, presents with 4-5 days of worsening SOB, wt gain, and LE edema. He went to his PCP's office today for evaluation and was found to be in rapid afib with HR in the 120s-130s. His PCP did an EKG which confirmed rapid afib, frequent ectopy, and new ST depressions. He was felt to have crackles on exam and was given 20mg PO lasix. The patient was sent to the ED for further evaluation. . In the ED, his VS were T 97.5, BP 134/37, HR 124, RR 30, sats 93% on RA and 96% on 3L. He was given a full dose ASA and 10mg IV diltiazem with no change in his HR. He received a total of 30mg IV diltiazem which eventually brought his HR down to the 90s, but it caused transient hypotension as well, with SBP in the 80s. He was given IVF to improve his BP after the diltiazem. He was also given 30mg PO diltiazem to attempt to keep his rate under control. CXR was performed which revealed slightly worsening pulmonary edema and loss of the R heart border, concerning for fluid vs. consolidation. His O2 sats continued to be in the low 90s on 3L so he was bumped up to 6L by nc. He continued to have frequent ectopy and was sent to the floor with his HR still in the 100s. . On arrival to the floor, his HR was in the 110s and his O2 sat was 89% on 5L by nc. He was felt by his RN to be awake, alert and appropriate, asking for food. Approximately 1-2 hours after arrival, his sats began to drop to the low 80s on 5L by nc. His O2 sats were difficult to monitor given his frequent ectopy, so he was put on a face mask with 10L O2. He was difficult to arouse and was somewhat disoriented. An ABG was performed which was 7.45/33/59, with a lactate of 1.4. He was placed on a NRB with improvement in his sats to the mid 90s. Repeat cardiac enzymes were sent. A foley catheter was placed with 400cc of UOP immediately. He was given 10mg IV lasix and 5mg IV lopressor. His BP remained in the low 100s and his HR came down to the 90s transiently. Repeat CXR showed worsening pulmonary edema, but no frank infiltrate. His mental status did improve somewhat and he was able to converse with me to confirm his symptoms, but he remained tachypneic with a RR in the 30s. . He was transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring. On arrival to CCU his BP was 100/60, HR 100-115, RR 30, Pox 95% on NRB. He was mentating well and had no complaints. We discussed intubation and cardiovesion, however pt wanted to wait a few days. Given his BL BP is around 100/60 we opted to give another dose of lopressor 5 mg IV. His BP dropped to 87/65. A heparin drip was also started. . Of note, the patient was recently admitted in late [**Month (only) 946**] to early [**Month (only) 541**] for chest pressure. He was r/o by three sets, a CXR was normal and his CP was thought to be related to anxiety. He continued to have arrythmyia c/w his tachy-brady syndrome. His BB was held and he was seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7870**] who did not feel a PCM was indicated at this time. His TSH was slighlty elevated but there was concern over med complicane so his prior dose was resumed. Prior to this, in mid [**Month (only) 946**], the patient was admitted for syncope and hypoxia and required a MICU stay, but no intubation. He had a holter in [**Month (only) 946**] that showed asymptomatic ectopic atrial beats and 25 isolated VPBs with 6 couplets and two 3-beat runs of VT, rate 110 BPM. 
The patient is an 83 yo M who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED from Provident NH on [**3212-7-19**], after being found partially out of bed, likely after a fall. Scrapes were noted on his R arm, leg, and abdomen.  The patient was noted to be drowsy, and he was unable to move the R side of his body.  At baseline, the patient was able to transfer from bed to chair, walk with a cane, and speak fluently.  During the episode, his finger stick glucose was 381. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of possible stroke and management of hyperglycemia. In the ED, the patient was hemodynamically stable, but was noted to have a WBC 15.1, glucose of 443, anion gap of 18, Cr of 1.5 (1.3 in [**5-15**]), and CK ~24,000.  CT head was negative for bleed or mass. The patient was initially admitted to the Stroke service.  After MRI/A showed no evidence of a stroke, the patient was transferred to the MICU for further management of DKA and rhabdomyolosis. In the MICU, the patient was aggressively hydrated for treatment of DKA and rhabdomyolysis.  Given concern for infected foot ulcers, he was started on Vanco/Unasyn.  He was followed closely by Neurology. Etiology of R hemiparesis was thought to be related to hyperglycemia, with concern that metabolic derangements caused "reactivation" of old stroke. MRI did not show evidence of an acute stroke. By [**7-21**], the patient was transitioned to SC insulin. CKs have trended downward.  On [**7-22**], the patient was transfered to the medical service. 
This is a 51 year old female with Down syndrome, dementia, seizure disorder and paraparesis, and aphasic since cervical cord surgery, who has been living in a nursing home and attending day care.  At day care, ten days prior to her transfer to the [**Hospital1 341**], the patient had a witnessed seizure involving the upper extremities lasting for fifteen minutes. The patient was shifted to the [**Hospital6 33**] where she was found to have respiratory distress.  Chest x-ray showed right infiltrate which was consistent with aspiration.  The patient was admitted to Intensive Care Unit and started on antiepileptics.  She became toxic at very low doses of Dilantin and then on Tegretol and was successfully put on Trileptal.  The dose of Trileptal was titrated up in relation to the occurrence of myoclonus. The patient was started on a course of intravenous Clindamycin and Tequin and supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation between 96 and 98% and physiotherapy, pulmonary toilette and inhalers.  Blood cultures were negative and sputum cultures grew out Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to Tequin, Gentamicin, Bactrim, Tetracycline and Vancomycin. On [**3456-10-24**], the patient developed mild congestive heart failure and was diuresed with Lasix 40 mg p.o.  The patient continued to be lethargic without return to her previous mental status maintaining inadequate oral intake of pureed diet and needing supplemental oxygen. Laboratories showed an increase in TSH and the dose of Synthroid was increased to 0.15 mg q.d.  The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] further management. 
The patient is a 58 year-old African American female with a past medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure and morbid obesity who was admitted to the MICU at the [**Hospital1 186**] [**Hospital Ward Name 510**] from home with a one day history of fever and mental status changes.  She had been home for only one day after a five and a half month rehab stay at Towers [**Doctor Last Name **] Rehabilitation hospital.  She presented to the Emergency Department with what was a one day course of fever and mental status changes.  She was difficult to arouse and was lethargic.  The patient presented with a temperature of 102.7 degrees Fahrenheit, respiratory rate 34 and an O2 saturation of 71%.  She was given oxygen nonrebreather and her O2 sats responded to 95%.  She had a chest x-ray done, which was poor quality, but showed an enlarged heat with evidence of a left lung base infiltrate versus atelectasis.  She had a CAT scan of the head, which showed prominence to the right side of the midline gyrus.  She was treated with nebulizers and was given one dose of Ceftriaxone 2 grams intravenous.  On hospital day one the patient's mental status improved and she was began on Levofloxacin 250 mg intravenous q 48.  Upon further questioning she denies dysuria prior to admission, but did report increased urinary frequency.  The patient also had a vague history of hemoptysis over the last two weeks and she reported one episode of hemoptysis while in the Emergency Room.  She also reported a history of blood per rectum for which she was given a colonoscopy in the past, which demonstrated no lesions or etiology of bleeding source.  This colonoscopy was done in [**3309-5-7**]. 
84 year old male with hx of HTN, CVA, cirrhosis, known ascites, presents s/p fall. Patient says that he got up from his couch, felt unsteady, and fell on his right shoulder and back. Says he may have felt a little dizzy prior to falling, but is not sure. The fall was unwitnessed. Patient doesn't think that he hit his head or lost consciousness, but son reported that there was LOC. He had had a beer and a sip of brandy prior to getting up off the couch.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 23028**] is a 75 year old male with known coronary disease, recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] with unstable angina. He ruled in for an acute myocardial infarction at that time and underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease. Prior to cath, was loaded with Plavix. He subsequently underwent cardiac surgical evaluation and coronary revascularization surgery was delayed secondary to Plavix load. He was eventually discharged on medical therapy. Unfortunately, he presented one day after discharge with rest angina. He was admitted for further evaluation and treatment. 
The patient is a 70 year old man, status post myocardial infarction in [**3311**], who presents with increased shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion.  The patient had cardiac catheterization with 100% left anterior descending occlusion, left circumflex 90% occlusion, OM1 90% occlusion.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is an 81y/o gentleman with Parkinson's Disease, CAD s/p CABG, sCHF (LVEF 25%), AFib on coumadin, and AICD who presented with hypotension, was found to be in VT, and is being transferred to the CCU due to recurrent VT after ablation today. . Of note, he was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 14845**] for pacer firing, and was started on Amiodarone 400mg daily.  Due to nausea and loose stools, his dose was decreased to 200mg daily on [**4-27**]. . Per [**Hospital1 1498**] admission note, on this admission he initially presented from home yesterday ([**5-21**]) with a caregiver for low BP (80/60) and elevated HR (140-145).  He had felt fatigued for the past 1.5 days, with baseline level of dyspnea.  Somewhat decreased PO intake.  In the ED, initial vitals were T 96.8, HR 144, BP 82/61, RR 18, and SpO2 100% on RA. He triggered for tachycardia and initial EKG was concerning for VT at 145 bpm. He was given NS 500 ml. CXR showed moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.  Labs were significant for Hct 33.9 near recent baseline, INR subtherapeutic at 1.6, Cr 1.2 near baseline, largely unremarkable electrolytes, Digoxin 0.5, and Troponin 0.07 up from prior values 0.02-0.03.  EP was consulted and he was pace terminated with ramp.  He was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1498**] EP service for continued management. . In the EP lab, he was found to have various morphologies of VT and underwent ablation.  After the procedure, he was found to be unarousable even off sedation, with right-gaze.  Code Stroke was called and he underwent CTA head/CT brain which did not suggest acute process. . He had 4 episodes of VT after his ablation: 1) In CT scanner. ATP did not pace him out-->externally defibrillated. 2) Outside CC3 elevator. Received Amio 150 bolus.-->externally defibrillated again. [No bed was available in the CCU so he was taken to EP lab holding area in the meantime.] 3) EP lab holding area. Lidocaine 100 bolus given. -->ATP-terminated. 4) EP lab holding area. Lidocaine drip started.-->defibrillated with his device. . On arrival to the CCU, patient is intubated, sedated.  Is on a Lidocaine drip; had been on low-dose Phenylephrine while in the EP lab holding area but this was discontinued. In ICU, pt was extubated on [**2677-5-23**] without complications.  He weaned off of lidocaine and has remained out of vtach.  Since extubation, pt has been experiencing some hypokinesia, and confusion, likely secondary to parkinsons.  Neuro is following and recommended continuing with home parkinsons meds. Pt was also on heparin drip. restarted coumadin on [**2677-5-23**] and INR is now 3.2.  Pt was also diuresed with IV lasix in ICU and was net negative 1L during stay there.  This AM, his cr bumped from 1.1 to 1.8, likely from overdiuresis.  Pt also has bicarb of 17 this am with gap of 20. On transfer, pt's vitals are stable 98.3, 80, 148/72, 18, 97% 2L.  Pt is oriented, but hypokinetic and hypophonic. 
46 yo M with sleep apnea, GERD, asthma, no known hx of liver failure who presents hematemesis with bright red blood. He states 2 days prior to admission, he had BRBPR and dark stools and felt pre-syncopal while sitting on a toilet as if things were "graying out". He however did not have any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting at this time. He then went to work the day after and continued his daily desk job at an investment firm and did okay throughout the day. He after dinner then exactly at 9:10 pm began vomiting up a sink full of blood. He then felt extremely pre-syncopal in teh bathroom and may have had a period of syncope in the bathroom. His wife found him lying on the bathroom floor awake and called 911. He then got up and layed down on his bed. EMS arrived at that time and he walked down the stairs and then was brought to the ED. His vitals on arrival were 98.8, 111, 108/64, 100% on RA. He then had 1.5L of bloody vomitus in the ED. His initial hct was 22 and he was given 2U of PRBC and 2L of NS and his hct increased to only 25. He was transferred up to the ICU urgently and GI plans doing a stat EGD. . He states that he does not drink, no tobacco, does not use any NSAIDS/ASA products. He does not have any hx of liver disease. Stable GERD with diet control and prevacid. 
88 year-old right-handed man with a history of reported coronary artery disease s/p CABG, dyslipidemia, and lymphoma, who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital3 **] after presentation with vision loss and falls.  The history is obtained from the patient, who has some difficulty relaying the details, and available documentation. The patient reports that he was in his usual health until ~3 weeks ago.  One day, while opening his eyes after showering, he found that he could not see from his right eye. The patient states that vision in his left eye was preserved.  He had difficulty reaching for objects in the right side of his field of vision.  The patient also states that he had several falls at that time, which he also attributed to his visual loss. However, over the following day, he reports that the vision in his right eye improved.  It remained "blurred" and did not entirely return to baseline.  He could see objects in front of the eye and could reportedly discern color.  He reports that he was assessed by his internist for these difficulties, and it was presumed that he had a "stroke."  Interestingly, he states this evening that he did not undergo imaging of his head at that time and no further evaluation or management was pursued. At the time of the event above, he had developed a building, sharp, right-sided headache, located retro-orbitally and involving the frontal and occipital regions.  It does not seem to radiate elsewhere.  He states that he has had the pain daily since that time, lasting for the majority of each day.  Though he has had occasional associated nocturnal awakening, he denies changes with position or Valsalva.  He states that he also has associated neck discomfort, but denies a history of trauma or manipulation. According to available documentation, he was "last seen normal" at ~9 pm on Wednesday evening.  However, he awoke on Thursday morning at ~7 am and noted worsening "blurred" vision in his right eye.  Though he usually walked with a walker, he was having worsening trouble with ambulation; the patient states tonight that he had fallen.  Family was apparently concerned that he was confused and "usually sharper" than his current state.  Blood pressure was 124/92, pulse 84.  His pupils were "pinpoint."  He was brought [**Hospital6 298**].  [**Hospital3 **] physicians were concerned by the presence of "medial rectus weakness" on the right side.  There was no evidence of atrial fibrillation on EKG. CXR showed no pneumonia.  A head CT, which I reviewed here, showed atrophy and a poorly defined low density region in the left parieto-occipital region, ~2 cm in diameter.  There was no hemorrhage.  He was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. Review of Systems: Has had diarrhea for the past 4 months.  Family has told him that his speech is dysarthric, though he denies incomprehension. He denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, focal weakness, numbness, tingling. 
This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, status post a stent to the right coronary artery three years ago, several bilateral lower extremity peripheral vessel disease, hypothyroidism, polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], chronic atrial fibrillation and chronic urinary tract infections who was admitted on [**2731-11-30**] to [**Hospital6 4949**] with acute respiratory distress, fever and hypotension after an episode of substernal chest pressure, nausea and vomiting.  The patient was brought to the Emergency Room where she acutely decompensated.  At the outside hospital, over one month course the patient was started on Dopamine from [**11-30**] to [**12-3**] was acutely febrile, had a white blood count of 34 and was intubated shortly after admission.  The patient had been on Ciprofloxacin as an outpatient for chronic urinary tract infection.  It was felt at that time that the patient had sepsis due to urinary tract infection verses pneumonia.  She was also anuric on presentation.  The patient was started on Vancomycin, Tequin and Ceftazidime.  She had improvement with decrease in her white blood count to 14 however, she continued to have fevers of 101 to 102 during the hospital course without ever isolating the source. The patient's antibiotic regimen was changed to Zosyn, Gatafloxacin and Diflucan for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] urinary tract infection.  She was also started on Solu Medrol on [**12-8**] for four days for unclear reasons. She became less ventilatory dependent and tolerated pressure support of 5 with a PEEP of 0.  She was actively diuresed with daily Lasix.  On [**12-15**] all the antibiotics were discontinued. On [**12-17**] the patient was extubated however, several hours later was re-intubated for tachycardia and tachypnea.  Was restarted on Dopamine and Dobutamine on [**12-17**] through [**12-20**]. She was unable to diurese secondary to hypotension.  An echocardiogram one on [**12-21**] showed an EF of 55 to 65%, moderate AI and MR.  Bilateral atrial enlargement. For sedation the patient received Ativan and Morphine on a p.r.n. basis. Upon family request the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1426**] for further management. 
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30 to 35%, who presents with respiratory failure to the Emergency Department by people at a local grocery store when they noted the patient's absence for several days. Per patient report, the patient had undergone a syncopal episode with loss of consciousness and head trauma three days prior to admission.  When the patient awoke, she was reportedly unable to move, and remained down on the ground for approximately three days, where she was found by her the event, however, denied fevers, chills, chest pain, and shortness of breath at the time.  She was hypothermic on presentation. 
71 y.o M patient who has CKD on HD (MWF)with a baseline creatinine of 3.0-3.2 now with gangreneous ulcer of LLE. He was seen at Dr.[**Name (NI) 1701**] clinic [**2781-6-9**], he was recommeded to be admitted for angiogram with possible intervention for revascularization in am. The ulcers started in [**Month (only) **]/08, patient had been on Augmentin for 2 weeks, that improved the looks of his L foot. Patient had R fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass graft '[**71**], CABG x 5 '[**75**]. Patient is legally blind. Patient denies any fever, chills, or generalized body malaise. 
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, status post angioplasty and stenting of left subclavian artery in [**3430**]. She was admitted to [**Hospital6 3057**] on [**3434-12-2**] for evaluation of left lower extremity pain.  She underwent an angiogram which revealed (1) right common iliac artery to common femoral vein arteriovenous fistula; (2) occluded right superficial femoral artery with reconstituted above-knee popliteal, mid popliteal stenosis, and 3-vessel runoff; (3) occluded left common femoral artery to popliteal graft with reconstituted left below-knee popliteal with stenosis of distal left popliteal into peroneal trunk, stenosis of left anterior tibial origin with very small anterior tibial/posterior tibial in left calf.  The patient also developed pain in her left arm and hand which subsequently progressed to a pulseless hand two days prior to admission.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] to further evaluate the left arm. 
The patient is a 43 yo woman with h/o morbid obesity, COPD, OSA, and recent PE on Coumadin, who presents with a two-week history of worsening dyspnea and productive cough.  The patient states that her symptoms began at the end of [**Month (only) 400**], when she "caught a cold" from her mother.  She has a history of asthma, and she states that she subsequently developed increasing shortness of breath, wheezing, and a cough productive of clear-brown sputum. She increased the duration of her nebulizations but states that this did not help her symptoms.  She also states that she has been experiencing subjective fevers, loose stools, and increasing lower and upper extremity edema for the past week. She also admits to PND and increasing DOE.  She is now only able to walk a few steps before becoming short of breath.  She was prescribed Lasix 20 mg daily at her rehab facility, as needed for peripheral edema, but she hasn't taken this since being discharged from rehab 3 weeks ago.  She thus presented to the ED for further evaluation. . In the ED, the patient's initial VS were T 98.6, BP 162/106, P 111, R 24-30, O2 83% on 5L (she normally wears 5L at home).  She was placed on BiPap, and her O2 sats increased to 100%.  She had diffuse expiratory wheezes on physical exam but no peripheral edema.  CXR showed cardiomegaly, and EKG did not show evidence of ST-T wave abnormalities.  She was given Prednisone 60 mg PO, Magnesium 2 g IV, 3 Combivent nebulizations, Ceftriaxone, and Azithromycin.  She was then started on a heparin gtt at 1200U/h for possible PE, given the fact that she was likely over the weight limit for the CT scanner.  She was then admitted to the MICU for further workup and evaluation.  At the time of transfer, her VS were BP 142/79, P 85, R 18, O2 97% on BiPAP. . On the floor, the patient continues to complain of shortness of breath and states that she has to go to the bathroom. Otherwise, she has no new complaints. .

Pt is a 75F with oxygen depended COPD and T2DM on insulin, who was treated at OSH with levaquin from [**Date range (1) 25381**] for [**Date range (1) 25382**] pneumonia. She was discharged home and was doing well until yesterday afternoon when she began experiencing sudden left sided abdominal pain with nausea/vomiting and bloody diarrhea. She was evaluated at OSH ED, where on presentation she was afebrile, with SBPs 170s and HR 71. WBC was elevated at 24.4, with 78% PMNs, 8% Bands. LFTs were normal, lactate 2.8. KUB showed no evidence of free air, CT ab/pelvis showed fluid loops in the small bowel and colon with wall thickening transverse and descending colon, and atherosclerotic calcifications throughout the abdominal aorta with apparent decreased flow throughout the celiac axis. The surgery and ID services were consulted, and were concerned for ischemic vs. infectious colitis (given her recent levaquin use for pna). Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she received 100 mg stress dose steroids, IV levaquin and flagyl x 1 this morning, and zosyn IV x1 this afternoon. 
Patient is a 75yoF with a history of COPD on home 02 and chronic prednisone, DM2, HTN who was recently hospitalized in [**Month (only) 213**]-[**2941-8-3**] for ischemic colitis s/p total colectomy with end ileostomy and chronic tracheostomy due to perioperative respiratory failure.  She presents with increased watery ostomy ouput, nausea/vomiting, and a UTI. . She was rehabbing at [**Hospital1 **], when according to her daughter, she developed nausea and intermittent vomiting on [**2941-9-5**], and subsequent decreased PO intake.  Her ostomy output increased to about 600-800cc daily since [**2941-9-6**], assuming a watery consistency. Urine output trailed off though creatinine remained at baseline around 0.7. She was empirically placed on IV flagyl on [**9-8**] though the initial C dif assay was negative. Otherwise, patient has denied fevers, chills, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, dysuria or hematuria. No malaaise or arthralgias. . Of note, she developed a resistant ESBL E coli UTI at rehab on [**2941-9-6**], and has not received treatment thus far due to concern regarding cephalosporin/carbopenem cross reactivity. Her foley was last changed on [**2941-9-5**].  Also, she has progressive anemia with HCT 23-24 in rehab requiring a unit PRBC on [**9-8**] with imrpovement of HCT to 25.

71M transferred from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital where he was admitted on [**7-25**] from home for fevers.  Admit Wc was 8 and there was a question of retrocardiac infiltrate by CXR. Blood cultures grew GPC in clusters.  Last HD was [**7-27**]. Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] has had L foot ulcers since [**1-13**]. He developed left first toe gangrene.  He underwent revascularization of the left lower extremity on [**2781-6-15**].  This included a femoral endarterectomy and transluminal angioplasties.  His dry gangrene has been stable and we have been allowing it to demarcate before amputation. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 25404**] is a 69 year-old male admitted to the Cardiac Service on [**3257-1-22**] for an electrophysiology consult prior to elective coronary artery bypass graft that was scheduled for [**3257-1-24**].  He had been previously admitted to the [**Hospital1 186**] early [**Month (only) 1082**] and had a catheterization on [**3257-1-8**], which showed 50 to 60% left main disease, normal left anterior descending coronary artery, patent left circumflex stent, subtotal AV groove, circumoral occlusion as well as right coronary artery total occlusion, but filled by collateral.  There is evidence of pulmonary hypertension. His EF was measured at 50%.  He was seen by electrophysiology at that time for cardioversion of his chronic atrial fibrillation.  At that time he sustained a 35 beat run of ventricular tachycardia during that cardioversion effort. EPS done this a.m. on [**3257-1-23**] showed areas needing cryotherapy for coronary artery bypass graft.  The patient also went into a complete heart block with junctional escape of 40 beats per minute with EPS and a partial ablation.  He had temporary pacing wires placed and his being placed prior to coronary artery bypass graft in the a.m.  He was stable at presentation with no pain or symptoms.  He denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, groin pain.  No headache, nausea or vomiting. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were 60 ventricular paced, 141/66 with a mean arteriole pressure of 89, respiratory rate 16 with a room air saturation of 97%.  Oral temperature was 97.7 degrees Fahrenheit.  He was in no acute disease.  He was in reverse Trendelenburg.  His mucous membranes are moist. His extraocular movements intact.  His pupils were equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.  His trachea was midline.  There was no evidence of carotid bruit.  His neck was supple.  His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezes, rhonchi or crackles.  Heart was regular, brady.  there was no murmur.  There was no ventricular heave.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities were notable for no clubbing, cyanosis or edema or calf tenderness.  He had palpable pulses distally.  Dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse bilaterally.  Neurologically, he was alert and oriented times three.  He was in good spirits.  He had a nonfocal examination. 
67 M with a history of spina bifida complicated by paraplegia, hydrocephalus with a VP shunt, colitis s/p colostomy, stage III decub on the buttocks, barrett's esophagus, 2 prior cardiac caths with normal coronaries (last in [**2723**]), who presents from an OSH for cardiac catheterization after an abnormal stress test.

He was ruled out for an MI negative cardiac enzymes. A stress test completed on [**2728-8-31**] revealed a reversible anteroseptal apical wall defect and a fixed inferolateral wall defect with an EF of 32%. He was placed on a nitroglycerin drip (2cc/hr, 12mcg/min), clopidogrel 75mg QD (started on [**2728-9-1**] without loading dose) held in the morning prior to cath, and aspirin. . He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath that revealed 60% distal LAD lesion, OM2 w/ 50% lesion, and no obstructive disease in LMCA and RCA. The LAD lesion was stented with a BMS. The cath was notable for difficult access in the right groin and eventually the left groin was used. He was admitted from the cath lab to the [**Hospital1 1498**] service on [**Hospital Ward Name 120**] 3, but shortly after arriving to the floor he developed a large hematoma in the right groin. His BP was noted to have dropped from 140s systolic on arrival to the floor to 100s. HR was stable in the 60s-70s. Pressure was held for more than 1 hour. An central line in the left groin was placed. The arterial sheath in the left groin was left in for a-line readings. A stat Hct from the a-line was 29; last Hct from OSH was 33.8. The pt was given 1U PRBC and transferred to the CCU for further monitoring. 
This is a 78 year-old male with a history of meningoma and cerebral edema with an uncle herniation admitted on [**3315-2-19**] with cerebellar ataxia. He was started on Decadron and also Azithromycin for question chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation/pneumonia.  He was discharge to rehab with planned neurology surgery on [**3315-3-13**].

65 yo F w/ h/o dilated, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, transferred from [**Hospital6 16958**] s/p VF arrest [**2-21**] thought [**1-17**] aspiration in setting of an EF of 20-25% and mod-severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 25434**]D placement.  Review of OSH reveals pt was at ENT office for management otitis externa, suffered witnessed arrest, CPR initiated with EMS giving 3 shocks, epi, atropine, and lido gtt followed by amiodarone gtt. Admitted to OSH ICU, intubated, treated for pulmonary edema and aspiration PNA w/zosyn (course completed). Echo showed EF 20%, no AICD. Neurology was consulted for hypoxic brain injury and she required NG tube placement for feeds [**1-17**] mental status but was able to tolerate honey thickend liquids/pureed diet at time of transfer.  Pt was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for [**Hospital1 **]-V pacemaker/ICD placement. . On admission to the [**Hospital1 18**] cardiology floor, the patient was unable to recall the details of the events leading to her hospital course.  She was continued on metoprolol, lasix 40mg p.o to prevent volume overload in setting of low EF and dilated cardiomyopathy.  Her outpatient cardiologist and PCP were [**Name (NI) 647**] to attempt to obtain her most recent catheterization records, but none were able to be located.  She received a cardiac MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for scar, which showed effective LVEF of 28%. Echo showed LVEF severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %). . Of note, she had been receiving oral ciprofloxacin for management of otitis externa, which were started prior to [**2-21**] although exact date unclear. She was switched to topical cipro on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] as was having continued drainage. There is some concern for QTc prolongation in the setting of prolonged use of ciprofloxacin. In order to determine whether patient suffered drug induced torsades de pointes which deteriorated into VF, she was transferred to the CCU for ciprofloxacin challenge. . The patient was given Ciprofloxacin in the CCU with a prolongation of her QT but without reucrrence of VF.  QT prolongation resolved by the following morning.  She underwent electrical mapping in the EP lab on [**3-9**], where they were unable to induce VT, and was transferred back to the floor to await her ICD placement on [**3-10**]. . On arrival to the floor, the patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other complaints. . REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient reports significant left ear and left facial pain for the last several days associated with drainage and worse with movement of the external ear.  Denies fevers/chills. Pt also reports becoming "thinner" and losing weight in the past several months but cannot quantify the amount of weight loss. She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

She limits how much she drinks since she has dysuria related to her UTI. She has had less energy and has been sleeping more over the past several weeks. The pt denies f/c s, CP, SOB, dizziness. . In the ED, the pts vitals were: T 97.5 P 60 BP 144/55 R 18 Sat 96%RA. EKG revealed NSR, LAD, inverted T in III, Q in III, and upright T waves in anterior leads (this is similar to [**6-28**] EKG but changed from [**12-31**] EKG in which there were TWI in I, AVL, and anterior leads, and T was upright in III). The pt was noted to have 5/5 strength on dorsi/ plantar flexion bilaterally, but [**1-30**] strength on hip flexion bilaterally. She had no saddle anesthesia and had good rectal tone. Neurology was consulted and recommended L spine/C spine. While at MRI, the pts K returned at 7.2 without peaked T waves on EKG. MRI was not completed and the pt was given Insulin 10 U IV x1, 1 amp D50, 1 amp NaHCO3, and 30 gram of Kayexalate. Her glucose dropped to 50 so the pt received another amp of D50. The pt was also found to have a continued urinary tract infection on UA, so she was given Levofloxacin 500 mg po x1. Prior to transfer to the floor, the pts K was down to 6.0. . ROS: The pt denies n/v, CP, SOB. She has some baseline DOE which has not worsened. She denies dizziness/lightheadedness. She has had a chronic UTI for nearly 8 mos treated with a variety of abx including levoflox, bactrim, without relief.

She received a nebulizer and was transported to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1924**]. Here she complains of shortness of breath and sore throat. ROS notable for intentional weight gain as above, chronic psoriatic rash, no abdominal symptoms, no other neurologic symptoms, ROS otherwise in 13 other systems and negative. 
Past medical history is also significant for chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and peripheral vascular disease.  He presents in congestive heart failure, most likely secondary to recent myocardial infarction.  The patient was admitted on [**6-21**] for right second toe open amputation, status post surgical procedure approximately on [**2632-6-22**], the patient was found dysphoretic, unresponsive, heartrate in the 120s, hypertensive, with blood pressure of 220/110, hypoxic and electrocardiogram showing ST elevations, consistent with acute myocardial infarction.  At that time the patient was given oxygen, aspirin, Nitroglycerin, Lopressor.  A catheterization was delayed because of resolution of ST changes with treatment.  The patient was supposed to go to the Catheterization Laboratory on [**6-26**], however, due to development of congestive heart failure, it was postponed and the patient was transferred to CCU for management.  The patient was transferred to CCU at approximately 1500 hours. He received 160 mg of Lasix and found to have already emptied one liter of fluid.  He states that he has not had any history of chest pain, palpitations or shortness of breath. No history of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no nausea, no vomiting.  He did have a history of cough with clear sputum. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7658**] is an 82 year old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease confirmed by stress test in [**2630-1-28**] showing inferior ischemia.  Past medical history also includes chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and peripheral vascular disease.  He presents with congestive heart failure, most likely secondary to recent myocardial infarction.  The patient was admitted on [**6-21**] for right second toe open amputation, status post surgical procedure.  On [**2632-6-22**], the patient was found diaphoretic, unresponsive, heartrate rhythm was in the 120s, hypertensive, with blood pressure of 220/110, hypoxic and electrocardiogram showing ST elevations, consistent with acute myocardial infarction.  At that time the patient was given oxygen, aspirin, Nitroglycerin, and Lopressor.  A catheterization was delayed because of resolution of ST changes with treatment.  The patient was then scheduled for catheterization on [**6-26**], but spiked a 101.4 temperature. He was also found to be experiencing congestive heart failure which lead to transfer to the CCU for management.  The patient was transferred to CCU at approximately 1500 hours. Earlier that morning he had received 160 mg of Lasix intravenously and found to have already emptied one liter of fluid.  He states that he has not had any history of chest pain, palpitations or shortness of breath.  No history of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no nausea, no vomiting.  He did have a history of cough with clear sputum. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination it was found that Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7658**] was moderately dehydrated evidenced by a mottled tongue, both pupils were equally round and reactive to light and accommodation.  There was no lymphadenopathy noted.  His heartsounds were muffled, notable S3 noted, no murmur, he did have a hepatojugular reflex, jugular vein measuring 7 cm above the right atrium.  In his lungs there were positive bibasilar crackles, no rhonchi and no wheezing. His abdomen was soft, nontender with no palpable masses.  He, however, did have sacral edema.  Extremities, his right leg showed mild erythema, positive swelling, positive tenderness. His right foot showed evidence of a second right toe amputation, no purulent discharge noted at that time.  Both heels showed minor ulcerations. LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent laboratory data revealed the patient had a white blood cell count of 12.4, hematocrit of 35.2 and platelet count of 121.  His creatinine kinase was 342 MB 4, troponin I of .20.  His echocardiogram was found to have an ejection fraction of 35 to 40%, left atrium and left ventricle were normal, left ventricle wall motion mid anteroseptal hypokinesis, basal inferior hypokinesis, aorta normal, mitral valve normal, trivial mitral regurgitation, no pericardial effusions.  His electrocardiogram was found to have sinus bradycardia at the old inferior infarct, anterolateral ST-T wave changes.  Chest x-ray was shown to have cardiac enlargement, moderate to severe congestive heart failure with pulmonary vascular engorgement, interstitial edema, small bilateral pleural effusion, left greater than right. HOSPITAL COURSE:  Stents were placed in the right coronary artery and the patient was placed on post-catheterization protocol medications.  He was continued on Aspirin, Atorvastatin, oxygen saturation, heparin at 1500 units/hour and Nitroglycerin drip.  He received three more doses of 80 mg of intravenous Lasix and was found to have diuresed 5 liters over the whole course.  He was given his Lasix and Lipitor 10 mg per post catheterization protocol.  He was also placed on low dose Lopressor at approximately 25 mg b.i.d. Pulmonary - The patient's pulmonary status initially showed pleural effusion, first in the right and then later in the left.  The patient was placed on Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia during unresponsive episode post surgery, and the patient's oxygen saturation was maintained above 94%.  Most recent chest x-ray showed no heart failure, no signs of pneumonia. Infectious disease - The patient was empirically treated for fever spike, most likely secondary to skin infection.  He was continued on Vancomycin and Levaquin which was renally dosed at 150 mg. Finally, we are awaiting Vascular Surgery to let us know how long he is supposed to stay on Vancomycin and Levaquin.  He is currently on day #14 of both.  The patient was also placed on Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia coverage. Renal - The patient has a history of renal insufficiency, 
83 year-old male nursing home resident with DM, CRI, CHF, CAD and PVD on aspirin and Plavix, history of CVA, presents to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with 3-4 episodes of coffee ground emesis and possible aspiration with one of the episodes of vomiting.

Started on Levofloxacin, but developed a rash with infusion according to ED note. Infusion was stopped and patient was instead given Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin and Flagyl for community-acquired/aspiration pneumonia.  Urine cloudy. ROS:  denies fever, chills, chest pain, palpitations, c/o cough x1mo, denies abd pain, diarrhea, c/o dysuria and constipation 
This is a 62-year-old male with known peripheral vascular disease and diabetes type 2 along with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30% that presented on [**2838-1-6**], for chronic ischemic changes in his right leg with a right foot ulcer. He had been having this for some time and had increase in difficulty in walking and was only able to ambulate short distances due to pain, especially worse in his right leg and his calf. He had also had this ulcer for several months now that was nonhealing in nature. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was with stable vital signs in no apparent distress. He had no neck bruits. He was in regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen was obese and he was nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds, was soft and nontender throughout. His right foot was noted to be cool with a right heel ulcer that appeared slightly necrotic in nature. It did not have any gross pus or significant erythema around it but it had been nonhealing for some time. His signals were faintly dopplerable in the right foot, but he did have good femoral pulses at this time in the bilateral groins. HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2838-1-6**], the patient was brought to the operating room on the day of admission and underwent the right iliofemoral endarterectomy with Dacron patch, right common iliac artery stent graft, right external iliac artery stent graft and a right SFA angioplasty x2. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was able to be extubated after the procedure, however, he did require emergent hemodialysis afterwards and was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit. The dialysis was done here because he needed a high level of monitoring during this with a history of congestive heart failure. He remained in the intensive care unit until postoperative day 2 when he was able to receive a floor bed. There, he progressed well and had another round of hemodialysis and was noted to be fit for discharge on [**2838-1-10**], postoperative day #4. He is stable at this time with plans to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and to call to schedule an appointment. He was followed closely by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 798**] of nephrology who plans to maintain him on his Monday, Wednesday, Friday dialysis schedule. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1.

Per report during the CTA, while lying flat and receiving the contrast, he became more acutely short of breath with increasingly labored breathing, tachypneic to 30, and desaturating to 86% on 3L NC. Expiratory wheezes and crackles bilaterally were appreciated. He was given duonebs, 40mg IV lasix, and started on a nitro drip at 0.42 mcg/kg/min. 1 SL NTG was also given. An EKG showed atrial flutter with 4:1 conduction but no ischemic changes. He was subsequently saturating 80% on FM and so was started on BiPAP, a foley was placed, and he was admitted to the ICU. Vital signs at the time of transfer were hr 57 bp 135/55 80% on FM, 99%/BiPAP. On arrival to the MICU the patient appeared to be in no acute distress and was breathing comfortably with sats of 93% on 5L NC. 
Information was obtained from discharge summaries and the patient.  The patient is a reliable historian. The patient is a 61-year-old white male with extensive cardiac history consisting of coronary artery disease, ischemic and alcohol cardiomyopathy, who over the last four months has been in hospitals and rehabilitation for cardiac respiratory problems and has developed foot and leg ulcerations which have not resolved with conservative treatment. The patient admitted to left greater than right leg claudications since his mid 30s but has been wheelchair-bound since [**Month (only) 115**] of last year.  The patient has been hospitalized in our institution from [**2671-1-7**], to [**2671-1-11**], for congestive heart failure which has been compensated and then on [**1-13**] to [**2671-1-17**], for urinary tract infection which is treated.  The patient returned for intravenous antibiotics, wound care and vascular evaluation. ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Combivent 2 puffs q.6 hours, Lisinopril 5 mg q.d., Lasix 20 mg q.d., Thiamine 100 mg q.d., Folic Acid 100 mg q.d., Multivitamin 1 tab q.d., Zantac 150 mg b.i.d., Flovent 110 mcg 2 puffs b.i.d., Desipramine 30 mg at h.s., Zoloft 200 mg q.d., Neurontin 300 mg b.i.d., Isordil 10 mg t.i.d., Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d., Aspirin 81 mg q.d. 
The patient is a 62-year-old Caucasian gentleman with a history of 3-vessel disease, peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of 25%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presented to the Emergency Department with depression and question of suicidal ideation. He had been seen previously the day before after falling from his wheelchair.  Imaging at that time was negative, and he was sent home.  During his Emergency Department evaluation, he reported nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath.  His last drink (per patient) was the day before.  In the Emergency Department he became more confused, tachycardic to the 120s, and hypertensive with systolic blood pressures between 180 to 200.  Laboratories in the Emergency Department were notable for a hematocrit of 27.6 (down from a previous baseline of 41), with guaiac-positive melanic stools on rectal examination, and a nasogastric lavage notable for coffee-grounds. A continued workup in the Emergency Department was notable for a chest x-ray with a right lower lobe infiltrate.  An electrocardiogram revealed increased ST depressions over baseline in V4 through V6 with the patient tachycardic. At that time, he was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Gastroenterology was consulted with Protonix 40 mg by mouth twice per day started.  A central line was placed, and he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells.  In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, an ultrasound-guided thoracentesis was done on the right pleural effusion and was negative for empyema; however, he became increasingly hypoxic and was finally intubated on [**2671-9-29**]. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was done which showed gastritis, but no other source of bleeding.  He had received two units of packed red blood cells, and his hematocrit stabilized.  His Medical Intensive Care Unit course was further complicated for a new right middle lobe infiltrate for which he was started on vancomycin.  He was unable to be extubated until [**10-8**] secondary to congestive heart failure and multilobar pneumonia. On [**10-8**], he was transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the medicine floor. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 24924**] is a 50 year-old gentleman with history significant for obesity and CHD who presents with chief complaint of abdominal and scrotal swelling and pain.  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 24924**] stopped taking his Lasix several months ago, as he did not appreciate the frequency with which it caused him to urinate.  Since that time he has noted gradually increasing swelling in his lower abdomen.  The region of swelling has appeared irritated and hard to Mr. [**Known patient lastname 24924**] at times; he has used Vitamin E lotion, which sometimes helps.  During the last several weeks, the area has become increasingly irritated, hard, and painful, and during the last two nights the swelling extended to his R scrotal sac > L. He has felt slightly feverish during the last several weeks, with occasional mild nausea.  He also notes increased shortness of breath during the last several months, with no acute worsening.  He denies chest pain, orthopnea, or PND.  He sleeps on 2 pillows at night, a requirement that has not changed. Of note, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 24924**] had a surgery on his R groin approximately 20 years ago at the [**Location (un) **] Hospital.  He recalls that he had injured a blood vessel while straddling a fence, followed by erectile dysfunction.  He had what sounds like a vascular graft bypass repair to restore blood flow to the penis, followed by resolution of his dysfunction. On ROS, the patient denies chills, abdominal pain other than superficially at the irritated region, changes in appetite, constipation, or diarrhea, dysuria, changes in vision, hearing, any coriza or sore throat.  He notes seeing some blood in his stool one week ago, which he attributes to his chronic hemorrhoids. 
52 y.o. male with morbid obesity, type II diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea and CHF who contact[**Name (NI) **] his PCP this morning to say that he was not feeling well.  At that time he mentioned feeling increasingly short of breath for approximately 3 days with generalized malaise.  It is unclear whether he was requiring increased oxygen.  At baseline he uses 2-5 L NC and is prescribed CPAP but is non-compliant.  His PCP called an ambulance to transport him to the ED. Of note the patient was recently admitted to the MICU on [**3127-9-24**] when he presented with hypoxia (80% on RA) and required BIPAP.  At that time it was thought that his hypoxia was secondary to his obesity related lung disease.  He was extremely aggitated secondary to his hypercarbia and signed himself out of the ICU AMA after only a few hours. . In the ED his vitals were temp 99.4, HR 88, BP 138/88, RR 36 with an O2 sat of 88% on RA.  He was noted to be extremely aggitated and had difficulty responding to questions.  He denied chest pain, fevers, chills, cough, sputum production or increasing oxygen requirement.  He reported pain in abdomen but was unable to describe the pain further and points to a site beneath his panus.  He denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, BRBPR. He denied any dysuria or increased urinary frequency. He did report increasing "shakiness" which worsened with his worsening respiratory status.  In the ED he received one dose of ativan 0.5 mg and was placed on BIPAP with an FiO2 of 0.5, pressure support of 15 and a PEEP of 5. . On arrival to the ICU patient was increasingly aggiated and his O2 sats were in the low 90s on BIPAP with 100% FiO2.  Shortly on arrival the patient desatted to the low 80s requiring emergent intubation.  ABG taken shortly prior to intubation was pH 7.07, PCO2 141, O2 122. 
Patient is a 52 yo m with recent hypercarbic hypoxic failure s/p tracheostomy on mechanical ventilation, insulin dependent diabetes, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and chf who presents with fever x 2-3 days with no obvious source. Patient was recently admitted with hypercarbic hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubuation and subsequent tracheostomy.  Found to have MRSA pna refractory to 24 d of treatment-- then switched to linezolid.  During his last hospital course, he was found to be in renal failure thought to be from ATN as it improved with improved bp.  He was discharged on linezolid, and continued at rehab ([**11-9**])scheduled to end [**11-16**].  Of note, picc line was changed to midline [**11-12**] with picc line tip cx negative.  He was started on cefepime, iv flagyl, po vanco, in addition to the linezolid all during the 5 day rehab stay. 
This is a 60 year old male patient with known murmur since childhood diagnosed with aortic stenosis two months prior to admission. He presented to the Emergency Department on the morning of [**9-18**] with complaints of chest pain off and on for three days prior to admission and chest pain [**1-29**], nonradiating, upon admission. He also reports some shortness of breath with minimal exertion and one episode of syncope. He denies nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, palpitations or dizziness. He was cathed on [**2820-9-21**] with findings of severe aortic stenosis with aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2, AV gradient 44.8 and one vessel coronary artery disease with LAD 80 percent, left main 30 percent, left circumflex 50 percent, RCA 30 percent. At this time, he is referred to the Cardiac Surgery Service and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] consult for consideration of CABG/AVR. 
This is an 80 year old male with history of coronary disease s/p CABG with a patent LIMA-LAD per cath [**2536**] on plavix, peripheral [**Year (4 digits) 1092**] disease s/p popliteal to posterior tibial graft on right lower extremity, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, presenting with new onset of bright red blood per rectum.  Mr [**Known patient lastname 24937**] developed acute onset of bright red blood this AM prior to making it to the bathroom - he had no abdominal pain or cramping, but daughter reported that he felt weak and looked pale.  He passed about 200 ccs of blood in the toilet. EMS arrived on the scene and apparently had a difficult pressure to appreciate; however consequently BP was noted in the 160s. He's never had hematochezia before.  Does take plavix and coumadin; INR was 3.9.  Usually INRs are within range of [**12-23**].  No recent history of motrin, aspirin, ibuprofen.  Had colonoscopy in [**2539**] which showed just external hemorrhoids with no other lesions. Transferred to MICU for further workup.  GI evaluated and plan on scoping in AM (endoscopy and colonoscopy). 
Chief Complaint:  SOB Reason for MICU transfer:  hypotension 81 year old male with h/o CHF (EF 20%), CAD s/p CABG in [**2531**], afib on warfarin, VT s/p [**Year (4 digits) 3883**] placement, GI bleed secondary to ?NSAID use, peripheral [**Year (4 digits) 1092**] disease s/p right SFA stent last week, ?dementia, presented with SOB. In the ED, initial VS were:  08:02 0 97.8 83 92/74 18 98%.  He triggered for BP 60s. Physical exam was notable for red blood on rectal examination.  Labs were notable for Hct 26 (at discharge [**5-15**] was 27.5), INR 2, Cr 1.9 (baseline 1.5). Also trop 0.61 with ECG showing no changes by report.   BNP 5900, Lactate 2.8. Patient was started on peripheral dopa but was tachy to 130s and switched changed to peripheral norepinephrine. On arrival to the MICU, patient is comfortable and conversant. He [**Month/Year (2) **] any pain and has no acute complaints.  His norepinephrine was decreased from .1 to 0.6 mcg/kg/hr. There was initial concern for upper GI bleed.  Pt reports dark brown stools with drops of blood at home, and reports state 1x 500cc melanotic stool in the MICU.  GI was [**Month/Year (2) 4161**], and stool was dark red, more consistent with lower GI/diverticular bleed. EGD was not performed because of high risk cardiac status and higher suspicion for lower GI bleed.  Baseline HCT 27-28, on admission HCT 26, rec'd 1U PRBCs, now 29, stable since admission. Pt has a complex cardiac history and severe peripheral [**Month/Year (2) 1092**] disease.  He has afib on warfarin. Had SFA stent placed last week, started plavix.  Also started 10 day course of TMP/SMZ post-procedure.  Also has [**Month/Year (2) 19606**], with EF 20%, mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and RV dysfunction, on [**2541-5-22**] TTE. Cardiology [**Year (4 digits) 4161**], no acute intervention recommended.  Pt will require lifetime anti-platelet therapy.  Per [**Year (4 digits) 1092**] surgery, plavix 30 days followed by aspirin for life.  He has CAD s/p CABG x 4 in [**12/2531**], and VT s/p dual-chamber [**Year (4 digits) 3883**] placement.  On admission troponin 0.61 --> 0.47 --> 0.56. Unsure of patient's baseline MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] [**5-23**], became combative, tried to leave.  Touched base with daughter and health care proxy, [**Name (NI) **], see social history for details.  Does not understand reason for admission or circumstances that brought him to the hospital. ROS negative except as per HPI. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 24937**] is an 81 y/o M with extensive past cardiac history including CAD (s/p CABG, prior PCIs with stenting), ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 20% and NYHA class III CHF (s/p [**Known patient lastname 3883**] placement), DM, HLD, HTN, A.fib (on Coumadin), PVD (chronic lower extremity ulcers) who presented with chest pain. The patient was at [**Hospital 99**] Rehab and at 02:10 AM was noted to have acute onset substernal chest pressure without radiation, [**6-30**] in intensity, BP 106 mmHg systolic at that time. EMS called and received report that patient had an episodic HR of 160 bpm without symptoms (unverified). Received nitro SL with improvement in pain. Also got ASA. On arrival, CP was [**12-30**] and substernal without dyspnea. No nausea, palpitations or diaphoresis. Denied shortness of breath or leg swelling. Of note, the patient was recently admitted here [**Date range (1) 24953**] with hypotension. No clear etiology identified during that admission but suspected to be cardiac. An echo showed a reduction in LVEF to 20% from ~30%. There were intermittent NSVT episodes. Also had slowly downtrending crit related to possible GIB. Mildly anemic and received 1 unit PRBCs. No scope performed but scope in [**1-1**] showed moderate gastritis, duodenal ulcer. He has known diverticuli. Mr. [**Known patient lastname 24937**] saw his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], on the day PTA where he was noted to be doing well. An [**Last Name (STitle) 3883**] interrogation did reveal on VF episode requiring shock. In the ED, initial VS were 98.3 110 106/62 16 94% 2L Nasal Cannula. Labs revealed hct of 27.0, lactate of 5.7, Cr 2.0 (baseline 1.3), BNP 11,422 (baseline ~5,000), trop 0.04 (c/w prior). ECG showed a.fib @ 114, LAD, occassional PVCs and IVCD, non-specific ST-changes with peaked T-waves (similar to previous). CXR without acute process. Guiac (+) with maroon stool in vault. The patient received vanc/levo/flagyl in the ED due to concern for sepsis. On arrival to the [**Last Name (STitle) **] initial VS were 97/55 109 100%2L. Patient is mentating well and [**Last Name (STitle) **] any CP/palp/SOB. Reports feeling cold. No signs of active infection and broad spectrum abx not continued in [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Can re-start if becoming febrile. 
Pt is a 75M with h/o CAD s/p CABG in [**3218**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to D1, SVG to RCA), DMII and critical AS who was scheduled for cardiac cath and aortic valve replacement two days ago ([**3237-6-15**]) and found to have elevated PCWP and severe TR/MR [**Last Name (Titles) 24956**]. He is transferred to CCU for volume status to be optimized before repeat AVR. . Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] in [**3237-4-18**] with dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. He was also experiencing episodes of unsteady gait [**1-20**] verigo. He was found to have severe aortic stenosis on echo during that admission (valve area <0.8cm2)and recommended to return at the end of [**Month (only) **] for aortic valve replacement. He was also diagnosed with a comm acquired pneumonia and completed a course of abx. After discharge, pt went to rehab for 2 weeks and then returned home where he continued to have vertigo and fatigue. He came in on [**6-11**] for scheduled cath pre-op and per pt showed that CABG vessels were patent (need to confirm this on official report). He was taken to the OR yesterday and per report found to have unexpected wide open with dilated RV on TEE. Surgery aborted procedure and he was returned to ICU. Reported PA pressures were 80-90. . 
Patient is a 75 year old male with PMH significant for CAD s/p CABG in [**3218**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to D1 and SVG to RCA), DM2 and critical AS s/p balloon valvuloplasty [**6-29**] with valve area improvement from 0.6 to 0.74.  He was recently discharged from the hospital on [**7-1**].  He reports feeling well and gaining strength the first week after discharge but for the past week has been getting dizzy and shortness of breath with minimal activity.  Visting nurse has noted approximately 14 lbs weight gain since discharge three weeks ago.  He got dizzy while tying his shoes today which finally prompted him to come to ER at OSH where he was noted to have pulmonary edema on exam, CE -ve x 1. He was tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of his decompensated heart failure secondary to his severe aortic stenosis. 
History of Present Illness:  Pt is a 70 year old woman with a PMHx significant for CBD stones and strictures and stents admitted for abdominal pain and planned ERCP. For the past 2 weeks she has not felt well with increased abdominal pain, worse after meals. No bloody stools. No N/V. She has been constipated intermittently. She describes the pain as sharp, and localizes it to her epigastric region.  She had fevers to 101 at home with chills.  She was taken by her daughter to [**Hospital3 **] where she had rigors and a temp of 99.  Her WBCs were found to be 22,000. Creat was slightly elevated at 1.4 in the setting of presumed dehydration. T Bili was 0.26 and LFTs were nl except for Alk Phos elevated to 139. She was given Levo and Flagyl and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP planned for tomorrow. . As for her CBD history, she underwent ERCP and stenting in [**Month (only) 1082**] in [**State 4500**] initially for acute CBD obstruction. Then she had more symptoms and underwent an ERCP in [**Month (only) 946**] of this year and the CBD was dilated with a suggestion of a filling defect or a stricture in its distal portion on initial cholangiogram and a villious like polyp was found in the distal CBD which corresponded to the stricture on cholangiogram/flouroscopy. This was biopsied and brushings were also taken and was found to be negatice for malignant cells.  A biliary stent was placed successfully in the in the CBD across the stricture.  In [**Month (only) 541**], she had another ERCP with replacement of the plastic stent with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] biliary stent after baloon dilation.  Brushings from this ERCP yielded "atypical ductal cells and atypical columnar cells in groups and singly. While this may represent reactive changes, a neoplasm cannot be entirely excluded." . In the ED she was given Vicodin and admitted. 
This is a 74 year old woman who presented to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 614**] on [**11-15**] with frontal headache and neck pain. She has a history of C4 fracture in [**2537-8-5**]. Since discharge she has had multiple episodes of fall and head injury although she was not evaluated for this. She has not experienced any change in vision, muscle weakness, loss of sensation or altered coordination.  She was admitted to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 614**].  During her admission, she experienced a fever to 102 and work up was started. Cultures were pending at the time of admission.  A CT was performed which demonstrated subacute on chronic SDH. She was transfered to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**] for further work up. 
This is a 74-year-old female retired psychologist with a history of presumed coronary artery disease (no history of cardiac catheterization, but hypokinetic mid-to-basal inferior and inferolateral walls and distal septal wall on echocardiogram on [**2537-12-2**]), subdural hematoma s/p left craniotomy and evacuation on [**2537-11-22**], known infrarenal AAA, and moderate mitral regurgitation who presents with left arm and shoulder heaviness, shortness of breath, and headache over the last 2 weeks, worsening today. The patient initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 614**], where she was borderline tachycardic to the 90s and hypotensive to the 90s sBP. It is unclear whether she was hypoxic prior to administration of a few liters oxygen.  EKG showed sinus rhythm with STD in V4-V6 and TWF inferiorly and laterally; there was also submillimter STE in aVR.  These changes were similar but more severe than the STTW changes noted on EKG dated [**2537-11-23**].  TnT 0.657 and BNP>[**Numeric Identifier **]. After discussion with the patient's neurosurgeon and initiation of heparin, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Upon evaluation at the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she remained hypotensive and borderline tachycardic.  Physical exam notable for poor breath sounds but R>L basilar crackles.  JVP elevated to 12cmH20. Regular rhythm with II/VI holosystolic murmur at left sternal border and apex.  Repeat EKG revealed improving STD in V4-V6. CTA was performed and was negative for aortic dissection or PE, but did show moderate-sized pleural effusions larger than prior with the suggestion of right-heart strain.  Na 140, K 4.4, BUN/pCr 20/1.1.  TnT here 0.68.  CT showed small left SDH and right frontal subdural hypodense collection, slightly smaller than prior, with no new hemorrhage.  Bedside echocardiogram showed large pleural effusions with slightly worsening left ventricular systolic function compared with 11/[**2537**]. She transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and was cath today which showed significant CAD RCA, LAD and wide open ischemic MR. She was very hypotensive and IABP was attempted but was unable to be placed. She was on max dopa and levo added for support. She was seen by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] and the plan was made for her to go to the OR for emergent CABG/MVR. 
25 year old woman with history of anemia, GERD (H. pylori), Bell's palsy, BRBPR, and several episodes of malaria who was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 24996**] for newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy presents today as a direct admit for worsening chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion for close monitoring via placement of a swan ganz catheter. The patient was relatively healthy until about four years ago (after she had had her most recent miscarriage) when she began to notice some fatigue.  Her exercise tolerance began to slowly decrease from that point - when she was able to walk >4 miles, to about 2 years ago when she was able to walk up a couple of flights of stairs to the past few months when she isn't very active so is unsure about how far she can walk before fatiguing. She began to notice a real decline in [**Month (only) 202**] of this year, and also began to notice chest pain/tightness and shortness of breath.  Over the next months this chest pain has been present all the time, but increases in intensity nearly every day, usually at night.  Over the past several days she has been unable to sleep secondary to the pain.  It is substernal, sharp and radiates to her back via her left side; it is associated with palpitations, and has a pleuritic component. She also notes lightheadedness and dizzyness especially with standing.  She denies diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting.  She has some abdominal cramping and has a history of GERD and gastritis to which she atrributes these symptoms.  She denies fever, weight loss, travel to places other [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Country 6527**] in the past year, recent viral syndromes, alcohol use, drug use.  Other positive ROS include: recent [**3-4**] week 2 pillow orthopnea, air hunger at night - she will wake up gasping for air and has taken to keeping her window open at night, increased urination in the mornings. She denies recent episodes of inactivity (long plane or car trips), and denies recent OCP use. 
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of CAD, CHF EF 45%, and gastric ca who is s/p fall 2 weeks ago that is post-op from ORIF of R shoulder for a displaced 2 part proximal humerus fracture. Pt fell 2 weeks ago sustaining both a right intertrochanteric hip fracture which was fixed at [**Hospital 1456**] Hospital and a Right shoulder fracture. She was discharged to rehab and was noted while in rehab to have further displacement of her proximal humerus fracture. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] saw her [**2726-5-12**] for evaluation deonstrating new displacement, she was scheduled for ORIF of the humerus on [**2726-5-17**]. Pt transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] secondary to hypertension to 210/... early in the operation treated with 80mg of propofol, 20mg labetolol, and titration of the sevoflurane. BPs improved to 120/..... In the [**Hospital Ward Name 328**] ICU, the patient was intubated and ventilated on SIMV and remained hemodynamically stable with SBP ranged between 90s to 160s on propofol. Extubated without difficulty at 9am. Post extubation her SBPs ranged in the 150 to 170s. Currently she denies headache, shortness of breath, pain with breathing, chest pains, vomiting, abdominal pains. She does note mild nausea at this time. 
46 year old female status post living-related donor renal transplant (6 yrs ago), IDDM since age 11 with triopathy, hypertension, and recent total vaginal hysterectomy with left oopherectomy, presented with acute onset right upper quadrant pain, nausea/vomiting, and fevers for a few hours. She was febrile to 101 on admission, hypertensive, wbc 19 (90% polys, 6% bands), and creatinine elevated to 2.9 (baseline low 2's). Urinalysis revealed >50 wbcs and positive nitrite and leukocyte esterase. She was started on renal dose levaquin for pyelonephritis x one dose (250 mg IV)in the ED. 
45 year old male with history of CHF woke up this morning vomiting black/red vomitus with chest pain.  Also having tan diarrhea.  He says he has had episodes similar to this in the past.  He initially presented to [**Hospital 8029**] Hospital.  There he was given ASA, NTG for his chest pain, EKG was unchanged, got Reglan, Morphine.  His cardiac enzymes came back positive so he was transfered here for further evaluation.  He had 1 unit PRBCs hanging on arrival to ED.  On arrival BP 165/98 and pulse 72. In the ED he was given 40mg IV protonix and 10mg SC Vitamin K. He notes that he has had increasing LE edema over several weeks. He currently notes upper abdominal pain.  He has back pain consistent with his baseline where he sustained an injury.  He denies nausea or chest pain at this time.  He says he is pretty sleepy all the time and is not currently worse than normal. He was admitted in [**2663-3-17**] with nausea and vomiting an EGD was performed as he was having some coffee ground emesis.  The EGD showed 4 AVMs that were cauterized, a duodenal polyp with normal pathology, and a small [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear.

Tox screen positive for cocaine. 
83 yo female w/ hx of PE in [**2520**] - anticoagulated on coumadin, CHF, HTN, hyperlipidemia, who presents with BRBPR. Patient first noticed bright red blood per rectum on evening of [**1-21**] and then again on am of [**1-22**]. She has had rectal bleeding [**12-22**] x per week for the last several months and though it was due to hemorrhoids. She was concerned as the bleeding was increased in quantity over the last two days so she called her PCP who sent her to the ED. Patient had also noted some mild nausea and crmping and mild LLQ pain and cramping. No vomiting or hematemesis. Patient had a colonscopy in [**2519**] which showed int and ext hemorrhoids, also had a polypectomy which demonstrated a benign adenoma. . Vitals in the ED: T 97.6, HR 59, BP 145/60 RR 20 sat 100% ra. On exam was found to have frank blood in rectal vault. Given her LLQ pain, an abd u/s was done to r/o AAA - scan was negative. While in the ED she had an episode of chest pain. No EKG changes, CE were neg x 3. CP ultimately relieved by SLN x 1. Per patient, she has a history of intermittent chest pain at home for which she takes [**12-22**] SL nitro every 1-3 weeks. Given her history of PE, patient also underwent a V/Q scan, which was negative. She also has intermittent shortness of breath which she attributes to her CHF, although at present is not dyspneic. She has had no cough or fevers. CXR was negative. At home she sleeps with her head elevated.

67yo male with h/o liver transplant [**3045**], severe OSA, pulmonary hypertension, and progressively worsening dyspnea over the last two weeks, admitted for diuresis after elective cardiac cath revealed biventricular elevated filling pressures, and now transferred to CCU in setting of acute on chronic respiratory acidosis requiring treatment with BiPAP. . Patient has had mild dyspnea on exertion at baseline for approx. last 1-2 years, but over past several weeks has noted progressively worsening dyspnea.  He has been unable to eat for the last few days seocndary to dyspnea while eating. Recent work-up by his pulmonologist, including PFTs, indicated severe restrictive pulmonary dysfunction with reduced lung volumes, but normal DLCO when calculated for lung volumes.  His pulmonologist also felt there may be a component of diastolic heart failure contributing to his worsening dyspnea, and he was referred for an elective right cardiac cath which was performed earlier today.  Cath revealed severely elevated biventricular filling pressures, as well as severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with only moderate elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance. PCWP was 38, PASP was 96. After cath, patient was admitted to the cardiology service for diuresis, as it was felt his dyspnea was primarily related to cardiac etiology vs. a pulmonary etiology. He received furosemide 40mg IV once (home dose furosemide 20mg PO daily). On arrival to floor, he appeared lethargic and was difficult to arouse. An ABG revealed a respiratory acidosis: 7.23/70/73/31. Of note, he had taken Benadryl 75mg PO at home prior to the procedure, and also received Fentanyl 25 mcg while in the the cath lab.  Respiratory therapy [**Name (NI) 647**], and patient transferred to CCU for BiPAP.  On arrival to CCU, vitals were: 95.5 100 176/86 32 100% on 5L NC.  He had been started on a nitro gtt in the cath lab after SBPs noted to be elevated to 200s, and after arrival in CCU his nitro gtt was titrated to keep SBP <160. Patient denied any chest pain, abdominal pain or nausea.  He was unable to fully answer questions secondary to his lethargic state, and a full review of systems could not be obtained.  Per medical records, no prior history of stroke, TIA, DVT, or known PE.  No recent fevers, chills, or rigors. No history of asthma or COPD, but patient does have h/o smoking 1-1.5 PPD for 45 years.  He has a h/o OSA and has been non-adherent to using CPAP in the past.  However per family report he has been using CPAP consistently at night over past several months, and has also been using for several hours a day. .

This elderly lady has a history of very severe peripheral vascular disease. She is status post a left axillary bifemoral graft and right femoral peroneal vein graft. She previously had a jump graft from the distal left axillary graft to the profunda femoris artery in [**3159**]. The entire graft occluded about a month and a half ago when she underwent a thrombectomy in the left groin. The left groin wound became infected and opened. The graft was exposed. She developed gram-negative Pseudomonas infection with bacteremia, is now having removal of the infected portion of the graft. Both her legs are entirely dependent on her axillary bifemoral graft and right femoral peroneal bypass so the graft must be replaced. 
Pt is 83 y/o F with h/o severe peripheral [**Month/Day/Year 1092**] disease s/p multiple [**Month/Day/Year 1092**] surgeries who presents with complaints of abd pain and diarrhea over the past few days.

This is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft), also with a history of congestive heart failure, type 1 diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypertension, who initially presented to the [**Hospital3 **] clearance because of a C2 fracture back in [**2966-12-6**]; status post a mechanical fall. She was cleared for surgery and switched from Coumadin to heparin at the time but requested to go home and have her surgery electively scheduled for [**2967-6-26**]. had a transoral resection of her odontoid and associated second soft tissues. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells and was extubated and given high-dose narcotics for pain management. On [**6-29**], she had a hypercarbic respiratory failure with an arterial blood gas demonstrating 7.02/99/134.  She then had two episodes of bradycardia secondary to vagal stimuli, and a pulseless electrical activity/asystole arrest.  She was brought back from both codes, and Electrophysiology was consulted. Electrophysiology placed a pacer wire (temporary).  She was also maintained on broad spectrum antibiotics for lower extremity cellulitis. On [**7-7**], she was transferred from the Surgery Service to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management of renal failure as well as difficulty to wean.  Her Medical Intensive Care Unit course was complicated by worsening mental status and ongoing acute renal failure. Her mental status was questionably attributed to narcosis versus uremia, and her narcotics were held at this time.  On [**7-10**], a CT scan of her head was obtained for just ongoing mental status changes.  A massive cerebral hemorrhage was noted at the time obstructing the fourth ventricle. Neurosurgery was consulted and a ventriculostomy drain was placed at the bedside.  However, the patient remained in neurogenic shock and continued to demonstrate unresponsiveness by all objective clinical measures.  She remained pressor-dependent to keep her mean arterial pressure greater than 70. Her code status was changed to do not resuscitate/do not intubate on [**2967-7-12**].  She remained in neurogenic shock. Her apnea test was positive for corneal reflexes and pupillary reflexes were absent. At 3:45 p.m., on [**7-12**], the patient was found to be unresponsiveness following a cardiac arrest.  She expired at this time.  The family denied postmortem examinations.

This is an 85-year-old male with an extensive cardiac history significant for aortic valve replacement, coronary artery bypass graft, peripheral vascular disease (status post femoral-popliteal bypass), required removal of the pacemaker in [**3117**], and type 2 diabetes mellitus who was transferred to [**Hospital1 341**] from an outside hospital for placement of a new pacemaker for intermittent bradycardia consistent with Mobitz type 2. The patient was admitted to the outside hospital on [**Month (only) 354**] The patient also has a history of pancreatitis, and his amylase and lipase were increased on admission.  The patient was reported to have made a rapid recovery, and his diet was advanced on [**10-10**]; and he reportedly tolerated a soft die [**Doctor First Name **] [**10-11**].  Cardiology was consulted and recommended further intervention for heart block. On admission, the patient experienced [**4-27**] to [**7-28**] left chest pressure.  It was different from his previous anginal and pancreatic pain.  He denied radiation to the back or extremities.  There was no improvement with sublingual nitroglycerin times three.  He was given morphine which resulted in nausea and vomiting.  A nitroglycerin drip was started by the nurse [**First Name (Titles) 150**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] improvement. Electrocardiogram remained unchanged without ST changes, Q waves, or inversions.  His blood pressures in the bilateral upper extremities were equal.  Cardiac enzymes were negative. A chest x-ray was unchanged from his previous study.  His amylase and lipase were still noted to be evaluated. Otherwise, the patient stated that his gastrointestinal discomfort was improved.  He was tolerating solids and had regular bowel movements.  He denied shortness of breath, fevers, and chills. 
The patient is an 82 year old female with no known prior history of coronary artery disease, with a history of lung, breast and colon carcinoma, who presented to [**Hospital 25848**] Hospital with a CK of 3,243.  The patient was in her usual state of health prior to her presentation to that hospital until three days prior when she developed dyspnea on exertion.  Her symptoms developed into dyspnea at rest, and she was noted to have an O2 saturation of 83%.  The patient denied any chest pain at that time. At the outside hospital, her EKG showed ST elevations in V2 through V6, with Q waves present.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] at which time she had a heart rate of 87, a blood pressure of 128/80 and an O2 saturation of 97 on five liters.  She got aspirin, nitro paste, Lopressor intravenously, intravenous Lasix, and a heparin drip. She was then taken to the Catheterization Laboratory on arrival at [**Hospital1 69**] which showed a total occlusion of her proximal left anterior descending, total occlusion of her left circumflex, 60% proximal right coronary artery and a 30% obtuse marginal coronary artery.  She had minimal right to left collaterals and left to left collaterals. Her right heart catheterization showed a wedge pressure of 27 and a PA-saturation of 49%.  Her ejection fraction was 15% with anterior and inferior septal akinesis with an apical thrombus present.  An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed secondary to cardiogenic shock.  She was going to be evaluated by Cardiothoracic Surgery for whether she is an operable candidate. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 904**] is a 66 year old man with CKD (baseline Cr 1.7-2), CAD, chronic back pain and recent hospitalization after a fall with altered mental status and acute on chronic renal failure who presents from home with weakness. Patient was discharged from rehab two weeks ago. Was initially doing well at home, but started having difficulty getting up and being active for a week. Per report, increased confusion, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 681**] in nature, over the last couple of days. VNA came to his home yesterday and drew labs which were notable for a elevated creatinine of 3.59 and hyperkalemia. He was brought to the ED for further evaluation and management. . In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.3 HR78 BP113/55 RR16 O2 sat95% RA. Initial ED labs were otherwise notable for K of 7.4, creatinine of 6.4 and BUN of 106. EKG with peaked T waves. Patient received kayexelate, calcium gluconate, bicarb, 10 units of insulin and 1 amp D50 with minimal improvement of K to 4.9 (after an interval increase to 8.8). Renal was consulted and recommended renal u/s, more D50 with bicarb, and placement of an HD line for emergent dialysis. Three hours into his ED visit an EKG was done, which was remarkable for ST elevations in the inferior leads, II, III, aVF. Initial cardiac markers were notable for troponin 3.70, CK 3965 and MB 82. Repeat troponin 3 hours later was 4.03. He was given aspirin 81, but given guaic positive stool heparin and plavix was held. Cardiology was notified and deferred catheterization secondary to time elapsed and his multiple other co-morbidities. Other notable labs from the ED included an initial WBC was 15 with 93% neutrophils. UA was notably dirty with >50 WBCs and a lactate of 2.2. Patient had a pH of 7.23 with an anion gap of 18. Patient's blood pressures dropped to 80s/50s, he received 3 liters of fluid in boluses and he was started on dopamine and neo. Pressures improved to 110s. Patient's sat's started to drop and he was showing signs of increased WOB. He was subsequently intubated with rocuronium and etomidate. LIJ HD catheter was placed. He was given a dose of Vancomycin and CTX for presumed urosepsis. . VS prior to transfer were afebrile, HR129 BP113/74 O2 sat 100% on vent. In the MICU, patient was intubated. Patient underwent beside echo with akinesis of inferior wall, EF of about 40%. . Review of systems: Unable to obtain given to patient's altered mental status. 
89 year-old female with history of duodenal bleed presents with painless BRBPR x 2. History obtained from patient and son. She lives at home with VNA and 24 live in aide. The aide noted frank blood in the patient's diaper. The patient/son reported no symptoms during this incident. He had verified this with the patient's aide and visiting nurse.

[**Age over 90 **] yoF russian speaking only with history of HTN, HL, TIA who was in her USOH until 4 days ago when she started having subjective fever, non-prodcutive cough, headache, runny nose. She was seen by PCP on tuesday and prescribed Z-Pac for bronchitis.  After being started on Z-pack patient had episodes of nausea, NB/NB vomting episodes. No appetite.  No abdominal pain or diarrhea.  VNA visited patient today noted to have O2 sats in mid 80s on RA and convinced patient to go to the ED.  In the ED she was noted to be hypoxic to 80s also complained of chest pressure which was non-exertional.   Vitals were T:98.4F, HR:74, BP:122/55, RR:16, O2:98% on 4L NC.  CXR was notable for likely R sided PNA, and signs of volume overload with bilateral pleural effusions and vascular congestion. Labs were notable for a WBC of 16.8, stable renal dysfunction with a Cr of 1.3, a proBNP of 10K, and a Tn-T of 0.13. She continued to have low O2 sats therefore she was started on BIPAP but swiched back when her sats came back to normal. She was given aspirin, IV heparin, nitroglycerin for possible NSTAMI.  She was also started on ceftirzone and azithromycin for PNA. She was seen by our cardiology service and found to have volume overloaded and pneumonia.  She was determined not to have NSEMI based on her EKG. She was given 20mg IV lasix in the prior to being admitted to CCU for further monitoring. . Currently in the CCU patient complains fo headaches but denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, chills, night sweats, abdominal pain, diarrhea.

This is 71-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic abdominal pain (status post esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2594-5-20**] showing gastritis), depression, hypothyroidism, and hypertension who presented with abdominal pain to the Emergency Department on [**2594-5-24**] associated with nausea, vomiting, decreased oral intake, and decreased urine output. Laboratories at the time of Emergency Department presentation were notable for a lipase of greater than 6000, amylase of 1321, elevated white blood cell count at 14.9 (with 7% bands).  Blood glucose was 136.  LDH of 1156 and AST of 866. Vital signs on presentation were temperature of 99.9, heart rate of 125, blood pressure of 145/98, respirations of 18, pulse oximetry of 95% on room air.  A CT scan of the abdomen showed moderate peripancreatic and perigallbladder fat stranding, and a small amount of gas in the gallbladder.  The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit after receiving ceftriaxone 2 g, Flagyl 500 mg, and levofloxacin 500 mg, as well as Demerol and intravenous morphine for pain control in the Emergency Department.  The patient also received fluid resuscitation with 5 liters of normal saline. The patient was presumed to have gallstones pancreatitis, and an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed on [**5-25**] showing frank pus at the major papilla, cholangitis, successful extraction of sludge and stone fragments, and a sphincterotomy was performed. Following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, the plan was to take the patient for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but surgery was delayed secondary to congestive heart failure treated with Lasix, and rapid atrial fibrillation (treated with a diltiazem drip).  Status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, the patient developed respiratory distress and a new oxygen requirement which was considered to be pulmonary edema but was also noted to have an elevated creatinine. Cardiology was consulted on [**5-27**] and recommended continuing with Lopressor and Lasix.  An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of greater than 55%.  As part of the congestive heart failure evaluation, a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed on [**5-27**] showing a central venous pressure of 16, a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 28, and a cardiac output of 6.6. Because of the elevated creatinine and difficulty diuresing the patient, the Renal Service was consulted on [**5-27**] as well for management of fluid overload. Recommendations from the Renal Service were to continue Lasix with electrolyte repletion, renal dosing of medications, and to add D-5 water for hypernatremia.  A renal ultrasound showed no renal artery stenosis or hydronephrosis. Between [**5-25**] and [**5-29**], the patient was treated with ampicillin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole.  On [**5-29**], the patient was transferred to the Surgery floor at which time the antibiotics were discontinued, and the patient began tolerating a clear liquid diet.  On [**5-30**], the patient was transferred to the Medicine Service for management of medical issues.

Details of this procedure are dictated in a separate operative note.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the post anesthesia care unit.  He was subsequently transferred to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit where he was monitored with a central venous pressure line.  He did have some mental status changes on postoperative day #1 in which she became severely combative, confused and agitated.  He had a slight temporary decrease in his O2 saturation that was subsequently evaluated with a blood gas which revealed a pO2 of 67.  The patient was then placed on a nonrebreather and a repeat gas revealed a pO2 of 139.  Despite this, the patient still has severe mental status changes and remained combative.  He had to get a copious amount of Haldol to control him and had to be placed on 1 to 1 monitoring. He remained confused and overnight had a decreased urine output that responded quite well with Lasix.  He improved slightly on postoperative day #2, but still required large 
Patient is a 66 year old woman with a history of CAD (status post MI in [**2784**] and [**2789**]), dilated cardiomyopathy, and CHF (EF 20-25% in [**2784**], 50% in [**2789**], 35% in setting of moderate to severe MR), who presented for a scheduled ECHO appointment today with two weeks of increasing shortness of breath.  Patient had been hospitalized in [**2792-10-21**] for a CHF exacerbation, but the symptoms, currently, are not nearly as severe.  She endorses 8 pillow orthopnea, PND, and decreased ability to sleep over the past several weeks.  She denies any chest pain, palpitations, or abdominal pain.  She endorses an infrequent cough, productive of green sputum.  She denies any recent weight gain or pedal edema. She also denies altering her diet over the holidays, as her daughter prepares her meals and is "careful not to use too much salt."  She states that her exercise tolerance has not changed markedly since [**Month (only) **].  She can climb one flight of stairs, but only does so once a night.  She can go to the supermarket and push a cart through the aisles. Patient is a direct transfer from outpatient clinic and is scheduled to be evaluated for an AICD or mitral valve replacement, after patient diuresed. On review, patient denies any previous sick contacts, hemoptysis, fevers, chills, or rigors. 
66 y/o female with known [**Month/Day/Year **] artery disease and moderate MR. Admitted for congestive heart failure. Work-up at that time revealed severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] artery disease. She was thus referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1275**] for surgical management. 
(Per chart, family, nursing home staff)  67 year old woman with multiple vascular risk factors s/p CABG and porcine MVR in [**12-27**], recent left leg cellulitis, now found unresponsive at nursing home at about 10:15 a.m. today. Per her daughter she has been intermittently confused since the left leg cellulitis a week ago, but she has been conversant and interactive.  Today at around 10 a.m. she was  speaking with her daughter on the phone and complained that she felt very short of breath, and she also sounded confused.  She hung up and about 10-15 minutes later the physical therapist found her sitting unresponsive in her chair. She had been incontinent of urine, which is unusual for her. Per the nurse on her unit she was not weak on one side, did not have a facial droop, but had her eyes half open and was moaning, and did not respond to their voices or touch. BG was 130's.  EMS arrived and reportedly noted a right hemiparesis.  She was brought to [**Hospital6 16810**], where she was described to be "aphasic," not following commands, but withdrawing all four extremities to noxious stimuli.  No further details of the neurologic exam are available.  Her blood pressure was 161/79 and HR was 51, RR 20 and she was afebrile at 99.6.  She did not have a gag and was intubated for airway protection.  She received a total of 4 mg of Ativan surrounding the intubation but there is no report of any improvement in her mental status with this.  She had a head CT which reportedly showed a subacute right frontoparietal infarct. Per records she was not given tPA due to her recent cardiac surgery. She did receive 600 mg ASA PR. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  There has reportedly been no change in her status since her initial presentation. Review of systems:  She was recently discharged on [**2-5**] after an admission from rehab for fever and altered mental status, found to have left leg cellulitis and likely C.diff.  She complained of SOB while on the phone with her daughter this morning. Otherwise, as above. 
The patient is a 67 year old man with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, status post bilateral above the knee amputation, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, abdominal aortic aneurysm, who presented with a two day history of cough, and one day of nausea and vomiting without producing any sputum.  The patient also noted feeling hot and experiencing diaphoresis.  He awoke on the day of admission and ate a normal breakfast and felt nauseated and vomited once.  He was [**Doctor Last Name 347**], he denied hematemesis, hemoptysis, diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum, melena or abdominal pain or dysuria. The patient called his primary care physician and was referred to an outside hospital where he was evaluated and found to have increased creatinine to 2.1, baseline in the high 1.0 range, and a potassium of 6.2.  He also had increased amylase and lipase of 188 and 368.  His CPK was 88 and troponin I was 0.9.  At the outside hospital, he subsequently became hypotensive into the 70s systolic and tachycardic into the 120s.  He was placed on Dopamine and transported to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management.  Symptoms were felt to be secondary to pancreatitis with acute on chronic renal failure and hyperkalemia.  Chest x-ray was clear and electrocardiogram was without changes. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 21597**] is a 68 year old man with a history of severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting, Type 2 diabetes, status post bilateral above the knee amputations as well as many other comorbid conditions, who is transferred from [**Hospital6 2863**] for management of congestive heart failure and cardiac catheterization.  The patient was recently admitted to the [**Hospital 1753**] Hospital for congestive heart failure exacerbation and received an automatic implanted cardioverter defibrillator on [**1-2**].  He was diuresed during that admission and transferred to the [**Hospital3 3534**] for rehabilitation.  He was readmitted to [**Hospital6 2863**] on [**1-22**], for placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter and cardiac catheterization via brachial approach to assess graft patency and his remaining native vasculature.  His catheterization was complicated by inaccessible vessels, although a left circumflex artery with an 80% occlusion was identified for possible intervention. 
This is a 67-year-old female with multiple medical problems including a complicated cardiac history, who presents from the outside hospital status post MI for cardiac catheterization.  The patient was in the Emergency Department at [**Hospital3 1181**] for evaluation and treatment of a left foot cellulitis that the patient has had for approximately one month.  While in the Emergency Department, the patient developed chest pain. This was associated with EKG changes.  The patient was admitted and continued to have EKG changes on the morning of admission, although she was chest pain free at that time. On [**3374-10-8**] at 14:10, the patient had an episode of nausea and vomiting being associated with desaturation.  On exam, she had diffuse crackles.  Systolic blood pressure was in the 200s, and the ABG was 7.20/40/63.  At that time, the patient was intubated and given 180 mg of IV Lasix. Chest x-ray at the outside hospital prior to intubation showed cardiomegaly with blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  There was peripheral vascular redistribution, prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.  Outside hospital laboratories the morning of admission revealed a sodium of 140, potassium 4.3, chloride 101, bicarb 28, BUN 89, creatinine 2.1, glucose 132, calcium 9.3, phosphorus 4.4, CK 219, CK MB 9.3, troponin 4.2, hematocrit 34.3, white blood cell count 7.5, platelets 171, and INR of 1.0. Following this bump in cardiac enzymes, the patient was started on Heparin drip and a 2B3A inhibitor.  She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization. On cardiac catheterization on arrival at [**Hospital1 341**], the patient's grafts were all patent.  Cath numbers included right atrial pressure 9, right ventricular pressure of 55/7.  PA mean 36.  Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 14, cardiac output 3.62, and cardiac index of 2.20. ECG shows sinus rhythm with poor R-wave progression, [**Street Address(2) 4727**] elevation in V1 and [**Street Address(2) 4727**] depression in leads V4 through V6 and II. 
The patient is a 67-year-old female with multiple medical problems and a complicated medical history who presented to an outside hospital status post myocardial infarction for cardiac catheterization. She was initially seen in the Emergency Department at [**Hospital3 1181**] and was evaluated and treated for left foot cellulitis the patient had for approximately one month.  While in the Emergency Department, the patient developed chest pain associated with electrocardiogram changes.  She was admitted and continued to have electrocardiogram changes on the morning of admission; although, she was chest pain free at that time. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] has a known history of dilated cardiomyopathy, with an EF of 20%. Previous workup at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital in [**2588**] showed a large area of infarct involving the apex, anteroseptal and inferobasal wall on Cardiolite study. Viability studies at that time revealed no viability in the apex and anteroseptal wall but there was viability in the inferior wall. An echocardiogram in [**2589**] showed an LVEF of 20% with mild mitral and tricsupid regurgitation. During this past year the patient has been experiencing chest pressure that occurs with exertion such as during sexual intercourse or when he is emotionally stressed (ex. when he is gambling).  His chest pain is relieved with nitroglycerin.  The pain does not radiate to his arm or jaw.  He denies any DOE, but does get SOB when he lays himself flat or on his left side.  He sleeps with 2 pillows at night.  Denies lower extremity edema, palpitations, dizziness, difficulty with erection, or claudication. 
This 77-year-old white male has a known history of coronary artery disease.  He is status post MI and stent to the RPDA in [**4-4**].  He presented to an outside hospital with CHF and a troponin of 0.4.  He complained of dyspnea on exertion, but denied angina, syncope, or diaphoresis.  He has had occasional chest tightness and lightheadedness.  He was transferred here for cardiac catheterization. 
The patient is an 83y/o gentleman with a past medical history of aortic stenosis s/p bioprosthetic AVR, PAF on coumadin s/p TURP approximately 3 weeks ago presenting with hematuria. The patient reports that 1 week prior to presentation he passed 2 large blood clots with urination with small amount of bleeding. He had no further episodes of gross hematuria until this am. This am he reported an inability to urinate since 3AM with gross blood and clots. The patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where he underwent foley placement with continuous bladder irrigation for several hours and reported heamturia cleared. INR 1.6. He was sent home on bactrim and foley in place with Urology follow up schedule for [**4-4**]. . The patient represented to ED with recurrent hematuria from foley, continued pain and decreased urine output. On arrival to ED, initial vitals: T 97.7 HR 83 BP 145/62 98% on RA. He was found to have a HCT of 23.2. T&S sent. He was given ceftriaxone 1gm IV, morphine 4mg IVX2, diluadid 1mg IV. Urology was consulted and the a rouche catheter was placed with subsequent successful irrigation. INR found to be 3.1 and Cr 1.8. 2U PRBC ordered. . On arrival to the medical floor, the patient reports pain at foley catheter site. Denies CP/SOB. Foley in place irrigative dark pink urine. 
The pt. is a 75 year-old female with a history of COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus and colonic adenocarcinoma who presented from [**Hospital **] Rehab with shortness of breath and chest pain.  The pt. herself is a poor historian and the history is per the nursing notes from rehab and the pt's. son and daughter. [**Name (NI) **] the nurse's note from rehab, the pt. developed chest pain which radiated to her left arm and desaturated to the low 80's early the morning of admission while being changed.  An EKG was performed at the time which was significant for 3mm up-sloping ST elevations in V1-V3. She was given an aspirin and metoprolol and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. Further discussion with the pt's son and daughter revealed that the pt. had been experiencing fevers approximately 5 to 6 days ago.  She also had a cough productive of yellowish sputum. Apparently she had a chest Xray at the time which was suggestive of pneumonia and she was started on levofloxacin.  She was also started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin on the day PTA. In the emergency department, the pt. reported that the chest pain had resolved without intervention.  Her first set of cardiac enzymes were not elevated. An EKG was performed which showed atrial fibrillation, ST elevations in V1-V3, TWI in V5 and V6 and LBBB.  She was initially saturating at 77% on 5L O2 via nasal cannula and improved to 96-100% on 2L NC and 95% face tent.  Her chest Xray was remarkable for pulmonary edema.  She was given 40mg IV lasix and urinated 1L.  She was also given combivent nebs and one gram of each vancomycin and ceftriaxone. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. On presentation to the MICU, the pt. complained only of some difficulty breathing.  She stated that the reason she came to the hospital was for a "panic attack."  She is unclear on the exact events that caused her to come to the hospital.  She did not complain of fevers, chills, diaphoresis, chest pain, arm pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, melena, BRBPR. 
58 yop male with history of St. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 911**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1276**] [**57**] year ago and known perivalvular leak, followed by echos.

Referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for redo surgery.Admitted on [**8-10**] for heparin bridge after stopping coumadin prior to reoperation. Cardiac cath will be done also. Last dose coumadin [**8-5**]. Had DDD pacer 5 years ago. 
This is a 81 year-old male with a history of systolic and diastolic CHF (EF 25-30%), tachy-brady syndrome awaiting pacemaker, h/o atrial fibillation, CAD s/p stent LAD X 2, stent LCx X 1, DM II, and CRI who presents from rehab with increasing shortness of breath and weight gain. The patient reports he has been in "poor health" since having a partial colectomy in [**State 107**] this past [**Month (only) 944**] for colon CA. Since then, he has experienced a 15 lb weight gain with worsening SOB. He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] between [**2-2**] - [**2-17**] for cough and was found to have a MRSA presumed hospital acquired pneumonia. He was treated with a 14 day course of vancomycin and ceftriaxone. During the hospital course, the pt was diagnosed with tachy-brady syndrome as well as sotalol toxicity in the setting of ARF, and EP was consulted who planned on pacemaker placement once his ID issues had further resolved and discontinued sotalol. Hospital course was also c/b a L brachial vein DVT and was started on lovenox. He was discharged to rehab where he was switched to IV lasix for diuresis and followed by the renal team for worsening Cr up to 1.5; however, on review of OMR it appears pt's Cr had been at 1.5 prior to discharge. Per rehab notes, pt's weight was 208 lbs on [**3-5**] and had increased to 212 lbs on [**3-7**] with a concordant increase in O2 requirement, sating 91% on 5L NC. His lasix was increased from 40 mg IV bid to 80 mg IV bid with reported poor urinary output. The pt reports he has difficulty ambulating to the restroom without shortness of breath. Denies CP, lightheadedness. Endorses palpitations on the night prior to presentation. In the ED, initial vitals were T:96.4 HR:105 BP:122/68 RR:21 O2Sat:100% NRB, weaned down to 96% 3L NC. EKG showed no new ischemic changes, CXR revealed worsening R and L sided pleural effusions, R > L. He was given vancomycin 1 gm IV X 1, ceftriaxone 2 gm IV X 1, azithromycin 500 mg IV X 1 for possible HAP, started on lasix gtt @ 4 cc/hr and was admitted for further evaluation and management. 
The patient was seen in consultation for an incisional ventral hernia secondary to a laparotomy for a left colectomy for bleeding, diverticulosis.  The patient is a 70-year-old gentleman with multiple medical problems, who had a left colectomy in [**2871**] for recurrent bleeding diverticulosis in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. He had an uneventful postoperative course, but developed a symptomatic bulge over the past two years.  He has had multiple other medical issues including difficulty with diabetes and blood sugar control and pulmonary issues.  He has had intermittent abdominal discomfort with crampy pain with increasing in the bulging in the ventral area as more recently. 
79M w/ PMH sig for Parkinson's, DM2 who now p/w appx 3 wk h/o progressively increasing SOB, intermittently productive cough, fatigue, and generalized malaise.  The patient was in his USOH until appx 3 wks ago when his wife noticed progressively increasing DOE which began to limit his activities of daily living.  For example, he became extremely tired and dyspneic by just walking a few feet to the bathroom.  His wife also noted that he began to mouth-breathe for the first time.  Then 2 wks PTA, he developed a cough, intermittently productive of clear phlegm w/ occasional yellow-mucoid streaks. ROS o/w remarkable for long-standing constipation, urinary urgency (most notable at night - 4 to 6 times) x 3 days, and elevated blood sugars over the past month.  He denies ever having any recent nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, chills, anorexia, chest pain, sick contacts, recent travel, lower ext edema, decreased urine output, increased abdominal girth, change in weight. 
This is a 59 year-old woman with no history of coronary artery disease with a recent echocardiogram done at an outside hospital with ejection fraction of 50% and moderate aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation who presented on [**7-16**] with fever and drainage from a breast implant that was placed two weeks ago after a mastectomy for breast cancer.  The patient was transferred to the floor and subsequently was noted to have an increase in the creatinine from 1.0 to 1.8, which the renal team confirmed was secondary to volume depletion and prerenal azotemia.  Therefore the patient was volume resuscitated with approximately 9 liters of fluid over the next two to three days with improvement of her creatinine to 1.4. On the [**6-19**] the patient was noted to be in respiratory distress on physical examination and chest x-ray revealed pulmonary edema.  The patient was intubated and transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.  The patient was diuresed approximately 3 liters and an attempt was made to try and wean her from the ventilator, which was unsuccessful. At this time she was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit Service.  In review of her history, which was obtained from her cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10089**] from [**Hospital6 1578**], in 10/99 the patient was admitted at [**Hospital3 **] for worsening pulmonary edema.  She was diuresed and a cardiac catheterization was done, which revealed clean coronary arteries.  Echocardiogram at that time showed a normal ejection fraction and she was discharged without a diagnosis. 
This is a 65 year old female with known coronary artery disease.  She presented to [**Hospital3 6187**] Emergency Room on [**2568-11-7**] with chest pain and shortness of breath.  The patient experienced progressive shortness of breath and hypoxia and required intubation. Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema.  The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit and treated for congestive heart failure with Lasix and Nitroglycerin.  On hospital day #2 the patient ruled in for myocardial infarction by enzymes.  The patient experienced a ventricular fibrillation arrest, was cardioverted times one to sinus rhythm and was transferred to [**Hospital6 253**] for cardiac catheterization. 
This is a 77-year-old female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (on home oxygen) who presented to the Emergency Room on [**6-21**] with a chief complaint of increased cough, decreased oral intake, and weakness for several days. Her home [**Hospital6 403**] had noted a decreased blood pressure this same period as well as weakness, and inability to ambulate, and decreased functional ability.  She was brought to the Emergency Room for evaluation of this. 
80yo F with h/o chronic lung disease from h/o lymphoma and XRT to the chest area in [**2757**], in remission since [**2758**], RLL pneumonia in [**3-/2761**] and recurrent pseudomonas and MRSA PNAs presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 614**] with respiratory distress now transferred to MICU here for further workup. She was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2761-5-2**] for hypotension and hypoxia, found to have pulmonary edema vs. pneumonia and dehydration. She was started on azithromycin and cefepime on [**2761-5-2**]. CTA of the chest ruled out a PE but did show a possible narrowing of the previously stented left main bronchus concerning for endobronchial mass, LAD, or esophageal mass impinging on the airways. She was evaluated by speech and swallow who recommended thin liquids and soft solids and suggested GI workup of esophageal dysfunction which was deferred to o/p workup.  She was taken off CFP after three days because she was stable and finished a 5 day course of azithromycin prior to being discharged to home on [**2761-5-8**]. Her son emailed her PCP [**5-12**] and reported that since leaving the hospital she had had poor po intake, coughing non-stop, and poor uop. The PCP faxed her [**Name Initial (PRE) **] prescription for guaifensin with codeine which she had been on before and recommended earlier followup. She then vomited yesterday and was weak. Her son brought her to [**Name (NI) 614**]. She was initially admitted to the floor even though her lactate was 5 and 86% on 2L NC with bandemia on her differential. They thought possibly aspiration PNA. Was doing ok til this am when they tried to get her up to commode where she had pre-syncope but when took [**Name (NI) 23102**] sounded like vaso-vagal syncope. Started on IVF but because extremely crackly throughout did CXR and was not fluid overloaded.  She was transferred to ICU was placed on NRB and was given lasix and moved to MICU. At first tried to take her off NRB but was low 90s/high 80s on 6L. ABG: 7.2/72/66. So started bipap. Tachycardic in 110s, temp 100.1. BP 100/80. Mentating ok but ABG abnormalities persisted so intubated. Peri-intubation was hypotensive and receiving 3rd Liter NS now. Creatinine is only 1, calcium corrected is 12 with known history of lymphoma. Has also a port from chemotherapy as well as subclavian placed at [**Location (un) 614**]. Had abdominal pain prior to intubation and with lactate elevation they wanted to do abd CT but did not get to it. In addition they wanted a chest CT to eval for PE and re-eval the esophagus and LAD seen previously but did not get to that either. They did place an NGT at [**Location (un) **] with lots of resistence and unclear if in right place per the attending at the OSH. CXR read there pending. . En route received Fentanyl bolus. Also put out about 60mL urine on the way over. On the floor, patient was initially 100% on 350X16 60% and 5 of peep. BP was 108/80 on 7mcg/min levophed. She was not completely sedated and with palpation of the abdomen had grimacing but did not answer questions or follow commands. . Review of systems: Unable given intubated but per son no diarrhea, fevers, abdominal pain. Positive for [**Location (un) **] and profound weakness (able to walk with walker normally and yesterday could not at all). 
86 yo M with a history of COPD, CAD, CHF, and remote history of "duodenal ulcers" presents with DOE for several weeks and and worsening nonfocal weakness x 3 days, and his found to have guaiac positive stool and anemia at [**Hospital3 7481**]hospital today, and is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. Patient reports 3 days of weakness, but denies other symptoms including nausea, vomiting, chest pain, abdominal pain and LOC. He has been hospitalized twice this year for pneumonia, and since that time has worse DOE, which has somewhat worsened over the last 3 days. He has been taking alleve 2 tablets daily for arthritis x 1 week, and is also taking steroids for a recent COPD exacerbation without any PUD prophylaxis. He denies melena or hematochezia, but also reports he does not frequently look at his stool. Also of note patient has been recently started on antibiotics (unsure what type) for MRSA RLE infection.  He has never had an upper endoscopy, and had a "normal" colonoscopy [**2-14**] years ago. . At OSH patient was found to have BRBPR, and coffee grounds from NGT which cleared with lavage. Hct was found to be 22, and there was an isolated BP of 92/41, but was otherwise normotensive. Patient received 2 U PRBC, 2 mg of IV morphine, and given one dose of protonix 40 mg IV prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. . At the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, repeat Hct was found to be 28. On exam, rectal exam revealed melanotic stool without gross blood. NGT output remains small amounts of coffee grounds. Patient was started on PPI drip, and 2 peripheral IVs were placed. Gi was consulted. On transfer, VS were 83, 130/84, 20, 100% 2L. . In the ICU, patient reports feeling overall about the same, but htat dyspnea is slightly better. He continues to deny abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea or vomiting. He still feels weak nonfocally. . Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies cough, or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin changes. 
74 year old female with CAD, dCHF, and CKD presented to an OSH today after calling EMS complaining of severe shortness of breath.  On arrival to the ED the patient was found to be tachycardic to 148, BP 140/58, 81% with EKG concerning for possible VTach.  Patient does have known LBBB at baselie.  The patient was emergently intubated for respiratory failure and was given a 150J shock x1 for possible Vtach though rhythm strips from the OSH were unavailable on transfer.  In addition, the patient was bolused with Amiodarone and started on an amiodarone drip.  A CXR showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates so the patient was also given a dose of ceftriaxone/azithromycin as well as IV lasix for posisble fluid overload.  A bedside TTE was performed which, per report, showed a reduced EF of approximately 30-35% at the OSH as well.  Initial cardiac enzymes were negative.   An ABG shortly after intubation was 7.15/45/66/16/86% and she remained difficult to ventilate requiring 100% FiO2 and PEEP 20.  Given her continued acidosis on the vent, the patient was given 1 Amp of sodium bicarb while in the ED.  Given the patient's complicated presentation, newly reduced EF, and possible cardiogenic shock, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further management and possible intervention. In the MICU, repeat TTE showed global LV systolic dysfunction w/ EF of 30%. Cardiac enzymes were trended and continued to rise, last trop of 0.52, CK of 7559, MBI 1.6. She was initially started on a heparin gtt due to concern for ACS, though this was later thought to be more consistent with a metabolic process/sepsis, and the heparin gtt was discontinued. Also, on review, rhythm was most likely consistent with SVT w/ abberancy, not VT. Amiodarone was discontinued. . Of note, patient had worsening of her chronic kidney disease from a baseline creatinine of 1.5 up to 2.7 thought to be secondary to hypoperfusion. She had a borderline UA at the OSH showing protein and blood without ketones or glucose. Abdominal US was performed to look at kidneys which were unremarkable. . She was also initiated on an insulin gtt due to persistently elevated BS in the 400s and significant AG acidosis on admission, now well controlled with a closed gap. No ketones or glucosuria. . The patient was extubated on day 6 of hospitalization, and developed flash pulmonary edema thereafter.  Was placed on home bipap regimen. Serial chest x-rays showed resolution of infiltrates, although congestion present.  Diuresis was started with diuresis goals of 1 to 1.5 L.  Hydralazine and isosorbide were started.  Echo was repeated on [**6-23**] and EF had improved to 55%.  For CAD the patient was continued on aspirin, statin, and metoprolol 75 mg tid.  The white count improved, trending down from 17.7 to 13. She completed a 7 day course of vanco and zosyn for hospital acquired pneumonia.  All cultured obtained at [**Hospital1 18**] were negative, urine culture from OSH grew out E coli and Klebsiella sensitive to cipro. Patient was afebrile. Following antibiotic course, patient was re-cultured after antibiotics were discontinued.  Stool was sent for c-difficile. The patient had several episodes of afib with RVR.  Beta blockers were titrated up to lopressor 75 mg TID for rate control and amiodarone IV drip was restarted for further nodal block.  Was then switched to PO amiodarone 200 [**Hospital1 **] and was in sinus rhythm.  Acute renal failure also continued to resolve with Cr near baseline (was 1.5).  Was transfered to the floor cardiology service for further management. On review of systems was unattainable due to patient being intubated.

EMS found her in respiratory distress unable to speak, requiring BVM ventilation, gave her Lasix 80 mg IV, nitro patch. She has been in and out of hospitals for the past year, and has been intubated three times over that period. During a [**Month (only) **] hospitalization she was diagnosed with CHF and reportedly had an EF of 30%, though her last documented Echo is of 55%. She has been out of rehab from that hospitalization for 3 weeks, and since arriving home she was started on BiPap at night, a low-salt diet, and has a home health nurse 4 days/week. Over the past 3 days her nurse tracked a 2-lb weight gain. 
This is a 69-year-old Caucasian female with known coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**3446**], ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of 25%, severe mitral regurgitation and diabetes.  She was in her usual state of health until [**3452-9-10**] when she presented to an outside hospital not feeling well, found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation.  She was rate controlled on Diltiazem, started on Coumadin, sent home.  She presented to [**Hospital3 23126**] Hospital on [**3452-10-22**] for elective cardioversion, having started on Sotalol 80 mg po bid the a.m. before.  She was cardioverted times two with return to normal sinus rhythm.  Her procedure was without complications until patient was found in the bed, face down, approximately two hours after cardioversion in V fib arrest.  She was coded and received CPR for 3-4 minutes and returned in normal sinus rhythm after one shock and 1 mg Atropine.  At that time she was started on Dopamine 3 mcg/minute and then Dobutamine was added secondary to hypotension.  These were titrated to 12 and 10 respectively. She was intubated and ventilated.  She had non sustained V tach and Lidocaine was started.  At this time she was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management and possibly an EP study.  On admission she was currently intubated, sedated, comfortable appearing. Upon her arrival her heart rate was in the 130's and Dopamine was 3.5 and Dobutamine was 2.

Pt is very poor historian due to baseline dementia. His wife reports that they ate dinner last night and after he felt "woozy" but was unable to more fully qualify it; he was pointing to his abdomen though. He went to bed at 9pm (early for him) and woke up this morning. He had difficulty putting his pants on, which is different for him, and complained of abdominal pain, possibly in the RUQ, but the history is not very specific. They went to BIDN where he had an RUQ ultrasound which showed pericholecystic fluid that was concerning for GB carcinoma. He was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further w/u. There, he received Cipro/Flagyl and 2L NS. Lowest blood pressure there was 90. In the ED initial vitals: 98.2 88 113/78 12 100%. No abdominal pain here.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 23190**] is a 82 yoM w/ metastatic prostate cancer who presented with confusion and generalized weakness. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer 9 years ago, at which time he received XRT. 6 years ago, given recurrence, he was started on Lupron; Casodex was started last year. He was followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1942**] at [**Hospital1 1998**], and was recently started on a new protocol using an amidogen product for bone metastases. Given severe progressive weakness in both lower extremities and lumbar back pain, he had a lumbar MRI [**3308-3-15**] (ordered by his neurologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 23191**]), which showed a tight stenosis at L4/5 and metastatic lesions at multiple levels, predominalty L5 and S1 with epidural metastases. He was admitted [**Date range (1) 23192**] to [**Hospital1 23193**]. There, he was started on steroids. EMG revealed generalized neuropathy and acute severe L5-S1 radiculopathy bilaterally, consistent with known stenosis/epidural metastases. MRI of cervical and thoracic spine revealed multi-level sclerotic lesions suggesting metastic disease. A bone scane demonstrated muld lumbosacral uptake, along with uptake on left lower rib cage, left femur, and right humerus. He was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23194**] of oncology, who discontinued Casodex (given elevated LFTs) and referred him to radiation oncology for radiation treatments - received [**3308-3-22**] and [**3308-3-23**]. Pt was discharged on [**3308-3-22**] to complete 10 radiation treatments as an outpatient; he also apparently transferred his oncologic care to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23194**] and was planning to follow-up with him as an outpatient. . On [**3-24**], his wife noted that the patient was more confused than usual - having to be reminded about the date or appointments. He also noted generalized weakness, although he cannot localize this to specific extremities. This prompted him to present to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, on [**3-26**] where he was noted to be febrile to 101. He was admitted and on [**3-27**] an MRI of the L spine was obtained showing metastasis. Steroids were increased to 4 mg dexamethasone Q6 and XRT was continued. As he was febrile, a course of levaquin was started for presumed CAP and UTI as he had a positive UA.  He was noted to be in renal failure on [**3-27**] and developed an O2 requirement for which he was diuresed without improvement. He grew staph from his blood and antibiotics were switched to vanco and pip tazo. . On day of transfer to ICU, the patient was noted to be in a.fib with rates in the 130's and hypotensive to 95/63. He continued to be confused. He was noted to have an Aa gradient on his ABG. He was transferred to ICU for further evaluation and management of his hypotension. .

She had been managed as an outpatient during her pregnancy and was on multiple medications including Lasix 40 mg daily, Hydralazine 25 mg daily, Toprol XL 100 mg daily, digoxin 0.5 mg daily and Lovenox 40 mg twice daily subcutaneously.  She also took albuterol on a p.r.n. basis for her asthma.  She has known allergy to penicillin, vancomycin and erythromycin.  She was evaluated upon presentation by the Maternal Fetal Medicine attending on call as well as by Cardiology.  She was found to have symptoms of congestive heart failure as well as decreased fetal movement. Fetal monitoring initially on admission was appropriate for gestational age. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, she was noted to have bilateral lower extremity edema, mildly elevated pressures in the 140 to 150/90 range, and jugular venous distension. HOSPITAL COURSE:  After consultation with Cardiology as well as Anesthesia on call that evening, it was decided to transfer the patient to the ICU for intensive monitoring. Central IV access was obtained.  The patient was carefully diuresed over the next 48 hours.  Symptoms of congestive heart failure gradually abated over the next 48 to 72 hours. The patient was given antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity.  A Neonatology consultation was obtained during the course of the hospitalization. After discussion, it was decided to attempt to obtain 28 weeks gestation and then deliver electively by cesarean section given the decompensation in the third trimester. The patient underwent primary low transverse cesarean section on [**2665-3-20**] at approximately 28 weeks gestation.  The cesarean section was performed on the [**Hospital Ward Name 511**] in the Cardiothoracic Surgical Suite.

Patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2, hypercholesterolemia, who presented to his primary care physician with complaints of chronic nonproductive cough times the past seven months, coinciding with initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy.  He also complained of dizziness, fatigue, and occasional diaphoresis, not related to exertion. He reports that he can walk up two flights of stairs and ride a bike without any shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, chest pain, chest pressure.  Additionally, he denies edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, syncope, presyncope. He was recently on antibiotics for cough with some relief. He had a recent admission in [**2939-6-4**] for a laminectomy. Patient's primary care physician ordered an exercise tolerance test/Myoview to rule out cardiac cause of his cough.  He exercised 18 minutes per standard [**Doctor First Name 298**] protocol. He had a blunted heart rate response and got 0.5 mg of atropine at 16.5 minutes.  He had no complaints of chest pain.  He achieved 74% maximal heart rate.  Myoview imaging revealed anterior ischemia.  Therefore, the patient was sent for cardiac catheterization on [**2939-9-10**]. Catheterization revealed severe diffuse LAD disease with proximal tandem 70% stenosis, subtotally occluded mid vessel, very small apical LAD.  Left ventricular ejection fraction was preserved at 65%.  He underwent successful PTCA, stenting of the LAD with two overlapping Cypher stents.  Additionally, the left main coronary artery was noted to be nonobstructed. Left circumflex was nonobstructed.  OM-1 was large vessel with an eccentric mid 40% stenosis.  RCA showed a 50% mid stenosis. Initially, the patient tolerated coronary catheterization well.  He was transferred to the holding area.  He then developed episode of hypotension to BP of 70s after femoral sheath removal.  He received IV fluid therapy, Integrilin was discontinued, and dopamine drip was started.  He was taken to CT scan to rule out retroperitoneal hematoma.  CT scan revealed a psoas hematoma. 
Pt is a 64y/o WF w/ a PMH of crohn's disease (c/b sigmovaginal fistula s/p ileostomy), CAD (s/p recent anteroseptal MI in [**5-1**]), and a recent admission for VRE/MRSA bacteremia c/b endocarditis who was admitted today after being found to be hypotensive and tachcardic at her [**Hospital **] clinic follow-up. The patient was recently admitted from [**2737-6-30**] to [**2737-8-7**] for management of her sigmo-vaginal fistula.  During this hospitalization, she received a diverting ileostomy but her course was complicated by severe hypotension that was eventually attributed to both VRE/MRSA bacteremia along with adrenal insufficiency.  She required several ICU stay during her last admission and was treated widely with antibiotics.  A TEE during her hospitalization showed some evidence of endocarditis and the patient was eventually d/c to rehab to complete a 6wk course of daptomycin and a prednisone taper (from stress steroids started [**1-28**] adrenal insufficiency).  She finished her daptomycin course last week (1st day [**2737-7-24**]) but was on 10mg of prednisone until the day of admission. On the day of admission, the patient was transported to her f/u ID appointment.  There, she was noted to be tachycardic to 120, hypothermic at 96.5, and with a BP of 100/palp while lying flat. She was sent to the ED for further w/u and treatment.  In the ED, she maintained her SBP between 80-110 with a total of 2L of NS boluses.  She complained of lower abdominal pain initially but this this resolved once her ostomy bag was emptied.  She spiked a temperature to 103 in the ED and was broadly covered with cefepime/daptomycin/flagyl as well as dexamethasone.  She was admitted to the ICU for further managment. In the ICU, she was afebrile and her BP was >90.  She was not tachycardic and denied any abdominal pain, CP, or SOB.  She denied any recent fevers or chills and did not have any nausea. Nursing at her rehab stated that she appeared well this AM and did not voice any complaints.
