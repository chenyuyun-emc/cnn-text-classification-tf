This is a 58-year-old man with a history of chest pain that dates back about 5 years ago.  He reports having about one year of exertional chest pain that ultimately disappeared spontaneously and did not occur until winter.  He was referred for cath on [**2933-3-14**].  Stress test positive for inferior lateral ST depressions but normal perfusion study.  Angiography had revealed a 70% tubular mid LAD lesion, circumflex left without significant disease, OM1 with two poles, the lower pole of 50-60% proximal lesion. The RCA had no flow limiting disease.  The patient underwent direct stenting of mid LAD followed by incomplete closure of RSA with angiocele.  On [**2933-5-27**] second angiography.  90% mid LAD stenosis, OM with 40-50% stenosis in ostium, 70% stenosis in lower pole.  RCA mild disease.  At that time underwent PTCA, LAD using cutting balloon brachytherapy.  In [**Month (only) **] had similar symptoms of chest pain.  Had a cardiac catheterization 95% discrete stenosis involving distal portion of previously placed stent.  The patient underwent successful stenting of mid LAD and restent stenosis.  The patient had recurrence of symptoms in [**Month (only) 354**] with right and left sided chest pain with emotional stress and light exertion.  He is currently referred for coronary artery bypass secondary to his severe and chronic coronary artery disease. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the OR on [**2934-1-1**] at which time an off pump CABG times two vessels was performed.  The LIMA was brought to the LAD and the left radial artery was dissected and brought to the OM2. Postoperatively the patient was on Nitroglycerin and Neo-Synephrine drips.  The patient was taken to the CSRU and extubated.  The patient had an uneventful course in the ICU and was subsequently transferred to the surgical floor in excellent condition.  The patient was started on Plavix and Imdur to decrease radial artery spasm.  Postoperative day #2 he was found to be doing quite well and heart rate was 91. He was subsequently increased on his Lopressor dose.  O2 sats were 98% on three liters.  Foley was discontinued.  On postoperative day #4 the patient was found to have a low hematocrit which came down to 20.2.  He was subsequently transfused with two units of packed red blood cells for post transfusion hematocrit of 26.7.  The patient worked well with physical therapy and was cleared by postoperative day #5. His Lopressor dose was increased again to 50 mg po bid secondary to high heart rate of 90's and blood pressure in the 140's. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Patient was discharged in good condition.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname 8513**] is a 50 yo F w/ h/o Schatzki's ring with multiple food impactions and s/p multiple dilations who, this evening, swallowed some steak and immediately was uncomfortable w/ throat pain and unable to swallow her secretions. . In the ED, she was noted to have no resp distress but with pain in throat and unable to swallow her own saliva. She was given 2mg IV lorazepam and 1mg glucagon to help dilate her esophagus as well as 4mg zofran IV. In the ED, GI and ED attempted EGD under concious sedation but she was given 90cc propofol without adequate sedation achieved and then began to drop her sats to 96% on 4L and have RR to 8. Notable, in the past, she has had to have intubation with EGD. Anaesthesia was consulted and plan was made to intubate and sedate her in the OR for EGD and food retrieval. Vitals on leaving ED to OR were 97.8 76 114/73 20 98% ? on NC. . EGD was noteable for food in stomach antrum and some esophagitis only. . On arrival to the ICU, pt extubated and states her symptoms are entirely resolved. She does state she was in her USOH prior to this episode with the exception of an episode of lightheadedness and tingling around her mouth last weekend which she attributed to dehydration. She drank more ICF and these symptoms quickly resolved. . Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, chest nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, dysuria. 
HPI: The pt is a 69 year-old R-handed male with minimal PMH who presents with new onset R sided weakness, slurred speech, left eye deviation, and right sided field cut.  Per wife at 8:30 pm patient developed 'tunnel vision' which then progressed into a headache.  Patient who has had a history of migraine head aches with what sounds like fortification auras did not think much of it.  He took a Xanax to help him fall asleep which he did so around 10 pm. He then woke up at 11pm and he told wife that he still has headache.  However, no neurologic symptoms were noted at this time.  However, when he woke up at again at 1am and his speech was garbbed and his wife called ambulance and to come to [**Hospital1 **] and code stroke was activated. In the ED, he presented with with eye deviation left eye deviation and right hemiparesis and aphasia. His CT showed left MCA sign and his CTA shows left ICA occlusion( can not rule out carotid dissection) and MCA occlusion. his CTP shows increased mean transit time and reduced cerebral volume and decread CBF. He was given tPA at 323am, but tPA was held due to severe vomiting and headache( also noticed trace blood in the emesis). His exam then worsened at 430am and he had hemiplegia and worsening aphasia. His score is 18. A repeat CT of head and did not show any hematoma. On general review of systems, the wife denies any recent illness, fevers, chills, chest pain, SOB.  No recent trauma 
42 F w/ metastatic Breast Ca (liver, brain, bone, lung) undergoing radiation therapy to the brain (last [**3362-10-26**]), recent chemotherapy (in [**Month (only) **] treated with abraxan), on decadron. She presented to [**Hospital 1456**] hosp last night with N/V, chills, SOB. At [**Hospital1 **] ED her initial vitals were significant for- T 99.9 BP 67/52, pulse 143, RR 20, 02sat 85% on RA -> 98% NRB. She was given 3.5L of NS, decadron 8mg, zosyn 3.375mg , vancomycin 1g and started on levophed (BP refractory to 2L of IVF). Her CXR showed bilateral hilar infiltrates. Her initial labs were significant for a WBC count was 1.1 (60% neut, 30% bands- ANC 660), HCT 39.2, plts 166. A UA showed some protein but otherwise was unimpressive. In the OSH ICU, Her BP was supported by levophed (4mg/min) and continuous IVF. Her 02 sats were 97-100% on an NRB. Her abx. were changed to ceftazidine/cipro/vanc for neutropenic sepsis.  She was continued on Dex 4mg po q6hrs. A KUB was done [**12-25**] N/V, which showed a lack of bowel gas. A Her family req. transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. She was intubated for airway protection and a R subclavian central line was placed ([**3362-10-26**]). 
This is a 72-year old female with a history of non-small-cell lung cancer, status post carboplatin and Taxol for two weeks prior to admission.  She was found on the floor by a neighbor and sent to the Emergency Room. Once she arrived to the Emergency Room she denied headache, dizziness, numbness, or tingling.  A computerized axial tomography scan showed a large area of edema in her central right posterior fossae likely representing a neoplasm; most likely metastasis from her lung cancer.  She also had mild dilation of her third ventricle.  No hemorrhage.  She had increased lethargy.  She was admitted for further workup of this new brain tumor. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denied fever, upper respiratory infection symptoms, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, or bowel complaints. 
80 yo M with h/o CAD s/p 3 vessel CABG, afib, obstructive/restrictive lung dz presents to the medicine service from the SICU after transbronchial biopsy for hilar mass complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure, SOB, and acute hypertension. Patient originally presented for EBUS with transbronchial biopsy of known hilar mass. The procedure was performed without incident. However, the patient's post-procedure course was complicated by hypercarbia and SOB, which necessitated observation in the SICU. His pCO2 was 87 at that time. He was oxygenated with BiPAP eventually weaning him to to 1L NC. His pCO2 decreased to the mid 50s. He maintained his oxygenation throughout. However, during this course, the patient became hypertensive. Given his extensive history of heart disease, the patient was ruled out for MI. The patient also has known afib but had not been anticoagulated given the recent procedure. . On transfer to the floor, the patient was in good spirits. He did not complain of any residual pain, though he did have blood tinged sputum. His BP was stable at 125/42. 
75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**3132**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and Diagonal), PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia who presents from OSH with STEMI on POD#1 s/p left shoulder surgery. He tolerated surgery well then was noted to be tachypneic and hypercarbic last night while on dilaudid PCA. ABG 7.15/61/57 so went to ICU for Bipap. Apparently improved then started vomitting at 5am. EKG at 8am showed NSR, NA, Q in III and aVF, STE II and aVF, <1mm STE V5-V6. TropI elevated to 90. He was sent here for cath. . In the cath lab, LIMA-LAD patent, OM and diag grafts closed, and SVG-OM was diffusely diseased w tight distal lesion. Thrombectomy performed on SVG-OM and dilatation with balloon improved lumen and flow. The distal SVG-OM anastomosis was stented with Vision x3 stents with initially normal flow. Flow then noted to be decreased followed by drop in systemic BP and increased STE inferiorly requiring increasing dopamine. IABP placed for elevated LVEDP to 25 and hypotension. Lasix 40iv given. Patient also with vomiting so anesthesia called for urgent intubation for airway protection. Difficult to oxygenate thereafter with O2 sat 88% which improved with increasing PEEP and suction. . Upon transfer to ICU, patient stable on dopamine 15, IABP at 1:1, and intubated with AC 500/18 FiO2 100% and Peep 10. Sedate so no ROS. 
The patient is an 80-year-old gentleman with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer diagnosed in [**2524-8-13**], status post debulking and gastrojejunostomy surgery as well as radiation and chemotherapy. The patient presents with a 3-day history of dark black stools, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath for one day, and also a 1-day history of mild right upper quadrant pain. The patient has no previous history of melena.  He has no chest pain, weakness, numbness, tingling, or dysuria.  He has chronic constipation and distention.  The patient is on chronic Coumadin therapy for a left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. In the Emergency Department, the patient was hemodynamically stable.  His hematocrit was found to be 25 (down from 34) one month ago.  The patient had a nasogastric lavage which was positive for coffee ground material which did not clear with two liters.  The patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells in the Emergency Department and admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was also admitted from [**7-25**] to [**7-28**] for Klebsiella bacteremia which was treated with a 10-day course of levofloxacin. 
The patient is a 62-year-old female with Parkinsons and dementia over the past year who for the past 4-5 days has been having worsening gait instability and decreased mobility.  She has also had some falls over the past few days which is new for her. Normally the patient is able to complete her ADLS with some assistance (although she does not cook).  In retrospect the family noticed some weakness in left arm and left leg.  Her movement seems to be worse acutely, although she does have some chronic problems as well.  Her movement apparently deteriorated to the point where she could not walk on Monday.  On talking to the PCP the family brought the patient to the ED at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 614**]. She was initially admitted to the hospital for possible stroke/infection work up.  An echo reportedly showed a normal EF and neuro recommended a head and neck CT. The neck CT returned with a left sided C3-C4 subluxation.  The patient was unable to go for the MRI at [**Location (un) 614**] given agitation and IV inflitration. When she was evaluated later in the day it was thought that her left sided weakness had progressed and so she was sent transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further care. 
63 YO F with Parkinson's and dementia (recent baseline oriented times 1) p/w hypotension, hypoxia and AMS from her NH. Conflicting reports about what happened at NH per the ED but as per EMT notes the patient became pale and diaphoretic then unresponsive with episodes of apnea. Her VS when EMTs arrived where 97.1 90/40 98 14 and 88% on RA. She was placed on a NRB with sat of 91%. She remained intermittently responsive with moaning. . Upon arrival to the ED, VS were: 95 102/62 14 95% on unclear amount of oxygen. Paitent was triggered with a BP of 90. Per report her SBP did decrease to the 80s but was responsive to fluids. A bedside u/s showed dilated RV with strain. She was started on a heparin gtt due to c/f PE. Prior to heparin gtt, rectal exam revealed brown guiac positive stool. Given hypotension and recent surgery the ED was also concerned for sepsis so the patient was given cefepime, vanc and levoflox. A foley was placed with cloudy urine and u/a had >50 WBCs. Blood and urine cultures were drawn. Exam was also notable for purulent drainage and staples from his surgery on [**7-7**] so [**Month/Day (4) **] spine was called. Per report, the ED was unable to express any pus but did obtain a CT neck with contrast which did not show a fluid collection. . Given c/f PE and unclear series of events, a CTA along with CT A/P with contrast were completed and was notable for extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli spanning from the distal main pulm art to the distal segmental and subsegmental arteries along with a LLL wedge-shaped lesion c/w an infarct. 
This 63-year-old Chef has been relatively healthy with the exception of chronic migraines and back pain, and hypertension.  He has suffered from other pain problems such as knee pain and neck spondylosis over time.  He has had a history of asthma and melanoma as well. Most notably, however, is that he had a distal gastrectomy with Billroth II reconstruction in [**2524**] for peptic ulcer disease.  He has also had a cholecystectomy in the past as well as a melanoma excision. His [**Last Name 3496**] problem is that of an unrelenting epigastric pain diagnosed as chronic pancreatitis elsewhere.  This has been going on since [**Month (only) **].  Apparently, he has had an endoscopic ultrasound evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8564**] at which time he felt the distal pancreas accessible through the stomach showed evidence of chronic pancreatitis.  Subsequent to that, he was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for another endoscopic ultrasound and [**Male First Name (un) **] was unable to access the pancreatic head due to the Billroth II reconstruction again.  A CT scan has been performed and this shows a hypodensity in the posterior pancreatic head which is worrisome for either a malignancy or a focal pancreatitis problem.  I will note that there is no evidence of ductal dilation of either his bile duct or pancreas duct, however, and the rest of his pancreas tissue looks normal to me.  There is no evidence of a distinct pancreatitis sequelae or destruction. Currently, he is at his wits end with his progressive abdominal pain, which has been with him since [**Month (only) **].  It is epigastric and does not radiate to the back.  It is worse after eating.  He has nausea and vomiting with this.  He has lost 30 pounds over this time.  He is on a fentanyl patch at this point for pain. He has no distinct history of current alcohol abuse.  He said he did drink some alcohol, but not had abusive levels in the past.  He stopped years ago when he felt that alcohol was not a good interaction with his pain pills used for treatment of his migraines and other back pain problems. 
This 81 year old Chinese speaking female came to the ER on [**6-5**] following a single episode of bloody vomiting and one maroon stool. She had been admitted at [**Hospital6 2523**] from the 17th to the 19th for hematemesis. There she was found to have a single gastric ulcer in her lesser curvature, transfused multiple times, given Protonix and famotidine; she was discharged on Protonix in what appears to be good condition. The patient was in her usual state of good health until about 3-4 weeks ago when she developed toothache. She started taking ibuprofen for it at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 5416**] dose. She had several episodes of tarry stools during this period and then had a single episode of bloody vomitus on the the 17th which necessitated her admission at [**Hospital3 **]. Following her discharge, the patient appeared to have done well until the early hours of this morning when she had single maroon stool. This was followed by vomiting of about 1 cup's worth of bright red blood. ER Course: Her blood pressure was 90/50 with a heart rate of 58. Patient underwent gastric lavage with normal saline which immediately returned positive. IV access was obtained. The patient was found to be thrombocytopenic to 36 and platelets were hung; 2 units of PRBCs were typed and held for the patient. She was transferred to the ICU for further management. MICU/ED course:. In [**Name (NI) **] pt was HD stable and Hct was 28. Pt was given 1 L NS and had NG lavage with 1 lieter which failed to clear. Plt count noted to be 36 so pt given 1 bag plt. Pt transferred to MICU. In MICU, pt recieved 2 u PRBC as Hct was 28.2. Repeat Hcts were over 30 until this 10 am [**6-7**] Hct 28.6. Repeat Hct ordered for 6 pm. EGD today showed red blood in fundus and stomach body. Single cratered 9 mm ulcer in insicura of stomach with suggestions of recent bleeding. Few superficial non-bleeding 3 mm ulcers in pylorus Over the last 24 hrs, Patient's hematocrit remained stable @ 29. No melena; no hematemesis. Remained on clears. Patient remained in ICU as no beds on floor. She is to be transfused 1 upRBC today and have a repeat hct check 
The patient is an 81 yo Mandarin-speaking female, who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-10**] after a 4 day admission for evaluation of hematemesis.  On her last admission, the patient had a HCT of 28 on admission.  She received 2 U PRBCs in the ED.  She underwent EGD on [**6-6**]. EGD disclosed "a few superficial non-bleeding 3 mm ulcers in the pylorus and incisura of the stomach.  Red blood was seen in the fundus and stomach body.  The blood was unable to be suctioned or lavaged due to clotting.  A single cratered 9 mm ulcer was found in the incisura of the stomach.  A visible vessel suggested recent bleeding.  Five Epi injections were applied for hemostatis with success.  Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis." The patient was started on an IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  Her ulcers are secondary to NSAID use.  In addition, she was using a Chinese herbal medicine which may cause increased gastric acid secretion. Following her brief MICU stay, the patient was transferred to the floor. She received an additional unit of PRBCs.  Her HCT remained stable, and she was discharged on [**6-10**] with a HCT=33.6. Last evening, the patient felt dizzy, and she was taken to [**Hospital1 8578**].  There she was found to have a SBP ~80.  She was found to have a HCT=24.  She was transferred back to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Per her daughter, the patient denies any episodes of hematemesis or melena since her discharge. In the ED, the patient was hemodynamically stable (BP 100/58, HR 71).  She was administered 1 L NS and 2 U PRBCs.   The patient declined NG lavage.

: Pt is a 40y/o male with a h/o HIV diagnosed in [**3144**], nephrolithiais, and Crohn's disease who was recently seen in the [**Hospital 18**] clinic to establish care. He has been fairly non-compliant with HAART regimens in the past and had been off any regimen for 2-3yrs, with his most recent labs HIV viral load greater than 100,000 and CD4 of 164; he has had no opportunistic infections in the past. His PCP and ID doctors decided to [**Name5 (PTitle) 8584**] off on initiating HAART, but did decide to initiate bactrim prophylaxis, a medication he'd not previously taken. On this medications, he first developed a pruritic rash and was advised to stop the medication but took an additional dose and began to develop nausea, myalgias, palpitations, and a headache, and came into the ED for evaluation. In the ED, he was given bendaryl, ranitidine, steroids, and fluids. He was hypotensive into the 80's and was started on phenylephrine with a good response, but was able to be weaned off over the course of an hour. Once in the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**], he reported feeling much better with the resolution of the majority of [**Last Name (un) 8585**] symptoms. 
This is a 29-year-old female with multiple medical problems including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, anorexia, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and multiple line infections, who was in Hematology Clinic today for parenteral iron treatment and became hypotensive.  She was premedicated with Benadryl, Tylenol, and Pepcid with a subsequent test dose over 15 minutes of IV iron.  One hour later, an infusion of 100 mg of Ferrlecit was infused and five minutes after the infusion started, the patient complained of back pain radiating to her shoulder blades bilaterally and she received 10 mg of Decadron for concern of allergic reaction.  At the time, her blood pressure was 110/70.  It then dropped to 50/palp.  She was placed in Trendelenburg.  She was given IV fluids, 20 mg of Decadron, 50 mg of Benadryl.  Blood pressure was 90/54, and she was sent to the Emergency Room. Family reported that she had a transient rash on her right upper extremity and face.  In the Emergency Room, she was found to be hypothermic at 94 degrees rectally with a fingerstick blood glucose of 20, which came up to 170 after 1 amp of D50.  She had profuse dark stool, which was guaiac negative.  She was given vancomycin and Levaquin for presumed line sepsis, and her blood pressure and heart rate stabilized.  However, of note, she had a recent admission in [**3060-1-5**] for line sepsis at which time a Port-A-Cath was removed and a left subclavian Hickman was placed.  This was removed in [**3060-2-5**],  and a PICC line was placed, which was later discontinued due to concern for upper extremity DVT despite negative ultrasound.  A left subclavian Hickman line was placed in [**3059-3-5**]. Review of systems is positive for nausea and vomiting times three days, fatigue, myalgias, sick contacts. 
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 9443**] is a 58-year-old male with hypertension, coronary artery disease, and AAA who was sent to the emergency department for evaluation of hypotension.

The patient reports that on the morning of admission, he had an episode of dizziness and a feeling that his head was very heavy while he was breathing.  The patient got up to use the bathroom and had a syncopal episode while arising from the toilet.  The patient struck the left side of his head and had loss of consciousness for a few seconds.  The patient then presented to the Emergency Department for further evaluation. The patient reports that the incident at home was not associated with shortness of breath but does report very dull pain / dull pressure sensation in his chest. In the Emergency Department, the patient had several more "episodes" of the dizziness, head heaviness, and flushing. On Telemetry, it was noted that the patient was in paroxysmal AV block with junctional escape during these episodes.  The patient had a normal neurologic examination in the Emergency Department status post fall with loss of consciousness.  ECT in the Emergency Department was bradycardic.  The patient had normal axis and intervals.  He had no ST or T wave changes. Pertinent past medical history reveals his first episode of complete block in [**2830-2-5**].

He completed 14 minutes on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol with the test begin terminated for fatigue.  The patient experienced mild left shoulder discomfort during the stress test but this does not change with exercise.  There were no EKG changes. The patient also had an echocardiogram on [**2830-3-1**], which showed the left and right atrium to be normal in size, normal left ventricular wall thickness and cavity size, left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%, normal AV, normal MB and normal TV. After discharge, the patient had [**Street Address(2) 2023**] depressions during peak exercise in leads II, III, AVF, V4 through V6 during Holter monitoring while running five miles.  The patient had a cardiac catheterization on [**2830-4-24**], to evaluate this. He as found to have a right dominant system with angiographically normal LMCA, left anterior descending and right coronary artery.  The left ventricle end diastolic pressure was mildly elevated at 19 mm of mercury.  The left ventricular ejection fraction was 64%. The patient reports that since his first episode of block, he has had three more similar episodes.  These usually last a few hours and are relieved by lying down. 
59 year old male in [**3305-3-5**] underwent a coronary CT as part of a research protocol which revealed a significant Left Circumflex stenosis. Follow up stress testing did not reveal any perfusion defects. On [**3305-3-10**] he underwent cardiac catheterization where he was found to have an 80% OM2. The RCA was patent and the LAD had a 50% stenosis in the proximal portion.  An attempt to open the OM2 was made, although was unsuccessful as the lesion was calcified. The patient reports that about two months ago he developed new onset angina. He describes mid and upper left sided chest tightness associated with pain in the neck and left arm. This only occurs with exertion, ie. Two flights of stairs. In addition, he has noticed new dyspnea on exertion. These symptoms typically resolve with rest or SL nitroglycerin. Recent stress testing has revealed inferoseptal and posteroseptal ischemia. He was referred for cardiac catheterization. Cardiac catherization revealed multivessel coronary artery disease.

: 81 year old male with Alzheimer's dementia, hypothyroidism, h/o GI bleed, gait abnormality, found in the locked Alzheimer's unit of his nursing home on the night of [**9-30**] with shortness of breath, increased secretions, and O2 sat 70% on RA. He was suctioned and put on O2, and then was taken to the ED. . In the ED, his VS on presentation were T 102.6, HR 120, BP 172/110, O2 sat 85% RA. After repeatedly removing his face mask, he began to appear cyanotic, and was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. His BP dropped to 73/39 after propofol bolus, but recovered to 113/28 with 200cc NS bolus. He received ceftriaxone 2g IV, Flagyl 500mg IV, vancomycin 1g IV, and Tylenol 650mg PR. Patient was DNR and unclear [**Name2 (NI) 828**] status but when he be continued to remain hypoxic, family decided to have him intubated and he was transferred to the MICU for further management. . Brief Hospital Course: Patient was continued on ceftriaxone and vancomycin for empiric coverage of nosocomial pneumonia. He was ruled out for MI with 4 sets of cardiac enzymes but had flat, mildly elevated troponins and CKs, likely secondary to demand ischemia. Complained of intermittent He was extubated on [**10-1**] without complication. Currently satting 92-100% on 3L NC with occasional need for NG suctioning due to poor management of secretions. He received 2 L IVF during his MICU stay and received 20 mg IV lasix just prior to transfer for suggestion of volume overload on exam. Also some concern over patient's swallowing ability. He has been on soft mechanical diet with upright positioning while eating. He has been able to tolerate his po medications. He has also been active, trying to leave unit [**1-26**] to his Alzheimer's and poor short term memory, and has required 1:1 sitter and Posey vest. 
47M with gastric bypass in [**2615**] (s/p 150# wt loss) and recent complaints of fever and cough x one month presented to OSH with cough, fever and found to have melena. Pt states he started developing RUQ and RLQ pain 2 days ago. He had a normal bowel movement this am but his next bowel movement was thick and tarry with visible blood associated with some diaphoresis. Pt then went to OSH ED where hct was noted to be 39. Pt also had a fever and was given Unasyn. Pt remained HD stable but given the melena, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. On arrival to [**Hospital1 **], hct was 31 with an SBP in the 90s. He received one liter of fluids and SBP improved to 140s. NG placed with 20cc of bright red blood and coffee grounds immediately on return. Lavage unsuccessful. Due to a fever to 102.8, pt was given one dose of Vancomycin. GI and surgery were called. In [**Name (NI) **], pt received 4L of NS, 4U of PRBCs and 40mg of IV protonix. . Per family, pt is very noncompliant with diet and takes no medications. He recently saw his PCP complaining of 21 day hx of nonproductive cough, nasal congestion, sinus pressure, ear fullness, coryza, sore throat, and malaise. Pt reports that he has measured his temp at home at 102. He also notes worsening dyspnea on exertion. A CXR was normal and he was started on a Z-pack. . On arrival to MICU, pt was HD stable but having continuous red stool output. He was emergently scoped by GI but visibility was poor [**1-11**] the large amount of bleeding. A pumping vessel was seen and injected with 10cc of epi but the scope was too small for adequate suctioning. The scope was then terminated after the pt vomited a large amount of blood. His BP at the time was noted to be hovering in the 80s-90s so an EGD with a larger scope was deferred. Pt received 9 more units of PRBCs, 2U of FFP along with 1.5 more liters of NS. An a-line was placed and BP found to be normal with SBP in the 150s. A femoral line cordis and right IJ cordis were both attemped and failed due to inability to find the vessel. Due to pt's stable BP and need for further scope, the line was deferred. The decision was then made to intubate for airway protection given the pt's emesis and high risk for aspiration. He was intubated by anesthesia without difficulty. The scope was then reattempted. This time, a large clot was seen at the gastro-enteric junction. The fold was injected with epi several times and then cauterized. The bleeding appeared to stop. . Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9994**] is currently asymptomatic, alert and oriented. He has been extubated and is sipping ice water. He denies abd pain, nausea and current cough/SOB. He has a rectal tube in for liquid melena, as well as a Foley.

Hematology - The patient is on Coumadin for treatment of DVT.  On admission elevated INR was thought to be secondary to inadvertent Coumadin overdosing.  The patient was taking total of 5 milligrams po bid.  His INR was reversed with 6 units of fresh frozen plasma and 10 milligrams of subcutaneous vitamin K.  The patient was also transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells for hematocrit of 35 down from baseline of 42.  Hematology was consulted.  TTP was ruled out by normal sphere. 7.  Neurologic - In patient with elevated INR and change in mental status. There is concern for intracranial bleed. CT scan of the head was negative for hemorrhage.  The patient returned to baseline mental status with fluid repletion. 8.  Infectious Disease - There was initial concern for sepsis secondary to patient's hypotension. The patient was initially empirically treated with Levaquin, Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin.  The patient remained afebrile and responded well to fluid and blood resuscitation so antibiotics were stopped. Currently the patient continues to have diarrhea but it has decreased in frequency.  No headache, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, night sweats. The patient was discharged for further care.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9644**] is a 73-year-old man with a history of a fib on Coumadin (INR 1.7) who presents with left hemiplegia and unresponsiveness, found to have large right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. His exam is notable for absent brainstem reflexes with pinpoint left pupil (right pupil post-surgical), extensor posturing in the UEs, flexion posturing in the LEs, diffuse hyperreflexia, and bilateral upgoing toes. This implies little if any brainstem activity, presumed due to compression by the large ICH. Etiology given the extent of the hemorrhage (lobar) may be amyloid angiopathy. AVM or uncontrolled HTN would be other options.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on his surgical date, [**3296-6-27**].  Went to the operating room and underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 23 mm Perimount Tissue Valve under general anesthesia with an indication of severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.5 cm, peak gradient of 134, and mean gradient of 70 by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**].  His cardiopulmonary bypass time was 153 minutes with a cross-clamp time of 126 minutes. He was transferred out of the operating room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit with a mean arterial pressure of 78, CVP/RA of 15, PAD 17, [**Doctor First Name 1038**] 23, A paced at a rate of 80 per minute.  He was on a Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.5 mg/minute and a propofol drip of 15 mcg/kg/minute.  He was rapidly weaned and extubated on the evening of his postoperative day. He was atrial paced at a rate of 80 throughout the evening of postoperative day.  On postoperative day one, he converted to atrial fibrillation with a max heart rate of 136 treated with intravenous Lopressor for rate control.  He was also started on amiodarone.  He was continued on small Neo-Synephrine drip for blood pressure support.  On postoperative day one, his chest tubes were discontinued. On postoperative day three, his Neo-Synephrine was weaned to off.  His insulin drip was off and amiodarone was changed to p.o. and he was in a sinus rhythm with a rate of 70.  He was transferred 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 23.9, and he was transferred to the inpatient floor. On the morning of [**7-1**], heart rate converted again to atrial fibrillation at a rate of about 140 alternating with sinus bradycardia and premature atrial contractions.  When in sinus rhythm and sinus bradycardia, he had a first degree A-V block with elongated Q-T interval.  On postoperative day number five, [**3296-7-2**], the amiodarone was decreased secondary to sinus bradycardia with EKGs follow QTc, atrial and ventricular pacing wires were discontinued also. He continued to have some short bursts of atrial fibrillation on the morning of [**7-4**], postoperative day six.  He experienced continued rapid atrial fibrillation with a rate of 140, blood pressure of 120-160 systolic.  He received an IV amiodarone bolus, which converted him to a normal sinus rhythm with stable blood pressure.  At this time, it was decided that the patient should be anticoagulated and he was started on a Heparin drip with p.o. Coumadin. He began receiving Coumadin on the 9th, receiving 2 mg of 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 4258**] is a 36 year old male with a past medical history of endocarditis secondary to intravenous drug abuse resulting in tricuspid valve replacement that needed to be removed for infection.

For three weeks the patient with daily episodes of feeling like the room was spinning around her only occurring with standing, relieved with sitting and lying supine associated with gait instability and need to support herself with walls.  No headache, visual changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, diaphoresis, upper or lower extremity weakness.  The patient was prescribed Meclozine by her primary care physician for unclear duration with no benefit.  The patient recently had a CT, which was read as negative a few days prior to admission.  An episode of not being able to stand up from cough without assist.  On the a.m. of admission the patient could not get up from her couch for six hours secondary to inability to lift head off the pillow.  Denies associated weakness of arms, legs, visual symptoms.  When the son arrived he helped her up and she ambulated with the walker.  The patient also reports significant nausea and vomiting over the past several days. On arrival to the Emergency Department the patient had a temperature of 97.3, blood pressure 183/76.  Pulse 99.  She received her Verapamil.  She had no acute complaints in the Emergency Department.  No vertigo, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  No recurrence of difficulty lifting her head.  Son expressed concern about the patient's slurred speech, which at the time of initial examination had resolved. 
83 year-old female with history of breast cancer, bronchoalveolar lung cancer with known brain metastesis.  She presents from home after an unwitnessed fall. The patient was taking a nap sitting up in a chair at home leaning forward on her table. She fell off of her chair towards the right. Her husband immediately helped her off of the floor and called EMS. At that time, she does not report any loss of consciousness. She may have hit her head against the wall. She did not complain of any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or abdominal pain.  Her family did not notice any seizure activity. She denies any recent fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting.  Her appetite has been very poor and she weighs 102 lbs down from her baseline of 118lbs. She has functionally declined over the past month where she is dependent on her family for help transferring to her wheelchair. She is on a decadron taper for her brain metastases, and has had severe muscle atrophy. She does not c/o of any changes in her bowel movements or urination. She does have a feeling of a "tickle" in her throat with a cough, but no hemoptysis. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 41 y/o M with history of recently diagnosed HIV infection (VL > 100,000, CD4 pending), depression/anxiety, and gonococcal infections of pharynx and anus who presents 2 days after discharge from recent admission with recurrent fever up to 103.8. The patient was admitted from [**2-25**] to [**2-28**] with fevers to 102 and acute renal failure. During that admission, his renal failure resolved with IVF, and his fever workup was remarkable for positive ASO titer without symptoms of pharyngitis for which he was discharged on augmentin. He was discharged on [**2-28**] at which time he felt fairly well. He continues to have joint pains diffusely for which he is taking oxycodone and tylenol. The patient has been taking his medications, including augmentin, as prescribed. . The morning prior to this admission pt felt somewhat unwell with "red eyes" and missed his augmentin dose. At that time his temperature was 101.2. He thinks that he took one bactrim pill by mistake as well as 6 ibuprofen but continued to feel poorly. His temperature increased to 103.8 at which time he came to the emergency room. Patient was reported to have a rash, but on interview in the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**], patient denied having any rash but thought his skin was somewhat red from his fever. He admitted to a frontal headache located just supraorbitally which has been ongoing since last week; he also had sinus congestion. He denied cough, ear pain or fullness, visual difficulty, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, nausea or vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, and penile lesions or discharge. He denied neck stiffness as well as numbness/tingling/weakness of the extremities. . In the ED, VS T 102.5 HR 131 BP 110/50 O2 97% RA. His blood pressure did fluctuate from a low of ~ 90 systolic up to 110. He received a total of 7 L of IVF. Lactate was 2.8. Blood cultures were drawn and an LP was performed which showed 3 WBCs (69% polys, 22% lymphs), 0 RBCs, protein 45, glucose 53. He was treated with ceftriaxone 2 g IV X 1, vancomycin 1 g IV X 1, and acyclovir 800 mg IV X 1; for his rash, he was treated with solumedrol 125 mg X 1 and benadryl. Imaging studies revealed normal CXR and CT was negative for incranial hemorrhage or mass effect. . Pt was subsequently admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for borderline hypotension. In the [**Name (NI) 152**], pt was started on azithyromycin for sinusitis. He was continued on ceftriaxone for presumed pneumonia based on RML infiltrate on poor CXR. He had extensive work up for fever during the recent admission and not source has been found at present. His hypotension responded to fluid and [**Last Name (un) 103**] stim was adequate. Pt was subsequently transferred to the floor. 
(Pt is intubated and sedated on arrival to the [**Last Name (LF) 152**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the history is provided by his significant other, [**Name (NI) 397**]). Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 42 year-old male with a history of HIV infection and Lyme disease who presents w/ a diffuse erythematous rash which started today at 11am. The rash was first noticed last week. He went to his PCP's office on [**3197-8-14**] when he first noted the rash. It was described as a generalized, macular papular rash on his torso and extremities. It was thought to be due to dapsone (which was being used for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1088**]) and it was recommended that he d/c dapsone. He had been on dapsone since mid-[**Month (only) 213**]. For PCP prophylaxis, he was then given inhaled pentamidine (on [**8-14**]) without any problems. The patient was advised to use benadryl for symptom relief. The following weekend ([**Date range (1) 9750**]), the patient continued to have what his partner described as an erythematous, "spotty" rash all over his body. It was not itchy, but the patient took benadryl and claritin RTC to help with the rash, without much improvement. He also stopped taking Atripla (his previous HAART medication) and began taking Kaletra and Truvada (the new HAART regimen which had been prescribed by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**3197-8-7**]). He was noted to have intermittent fevers to 101 and "heart palpitations". His partner denied any symptoms of night sweats, chills, SOB, chest pain, cough, URI sx, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea. He was noted to be fatigued and his partner states that the patient "slept for the last 3 days". By Tuesday ([**8-19**]), the patient's rash had resolved and he went to work without any complaints. He was noted to have more energy that evening and slept well. However, upon waking on [**3197-8-20**], he noted to his partner that he felt poorly but tried to go to work. He also told his partner that he was beginning a new medication today for pneumonia but it was unclear what medication this was. The patient then presented to the ER for further evaluation. . In the ER, initial VS were T 98.6, BP 103/51, HR 110, RR 18, sats of 99% on RA. His initial complaint was of an allergic reaction at work -he noted that his skin was warm, dry, flushed and his eyes were red and itchy. He quickly then dropped his BP to 74/41. He was bolused w/ IVF and started on vancomycin. His temp started to rise and he was given ibuprofen. IVF were continually bolused and CTX was given. His SBP remained in the 70s so he was put on dopamine through a peripheral IV while a central line was placed. He was then switched to levophed. He then became hypoxic with increasing O2 requirement and was intubated in the ER using etomidate/succinylcholine. He received a total of 5.5L of NS and had 80cc UOP (a foley had been placed). Dermatology was consulted in the ER and had a ddx of drug hypersensitivity, viral exanthem, or infection. They did not feel that this was SJS. . Per the PCP notes at [**Name9 (PRE) 771**], the patient had stopped Atripla on [**8-9**] due to a rash and had begun on Kaletra/Truvada on [**8-10**]. The rash was felt to be self-limited as it resolved with discontinuation of Atripla. He also noted that he had continued on the dapsone up until [**3197-8-16**]. He commented on resolution of the rash, but did note a HA over the weekend that was [**7-25**]. Given pt's intubated status and conflicting story from his partner, it is unclear what meds the patient was receiving and when he had discontinued others. . Of note, the patient was admitted with a similar chief complaint in [**2-19**]. He presented with fever, acute renal failure, anemia and joint pain. He was diagnosed with acute HIV infection (VL >100,000K, CD4 of 180) and the remainder of the infectious w/u was negative. ASO titer was positive and complement levels were negative, but the patient was treated with a full course of augmentin anyways. Anemia was felt to be due to iron deficiency and outpatient workup was recommended. He then presented 2 days after discharge with fever to 103.8, "red eyes", and rash. He had a lactate of 2.8 at the time. He was initially treated with CTX, vanco and acyclovir, had an LP (neg for meningitis), head CT (neg for bleed), and CXR (no infiltrate). His abx were initially switched to CTX and azithromycin. Lyme antibody was positive so his antibiotics were switched to doxycycline for a 30 day course. He was discharged on cipro eye drops and atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1088**]. 
Patient is a 71-year-old gentleman with one-week and two-day history of headache and fevers to 103 on [**2965-2-16**].  Took several aspirin every three to four hours in combination with his nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and continued to have headache.  Not drinking a lot of water because of nausea.  On the morning of admission he was confused and not much talking and not responding to questions, holding his right head in pain. Four or five days prior to this he had an episode of emesis. No history of head trauma.  No numbness, no weakness reported. 
Patient is a 72-year-old man with past medical history significant for coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes who was transferred from an outside hospital after having a large right-sided MCA stroke in the setting of a cardiac catheterization on [**2834-3-29**], having subsequent cerebral edema with midline shift of 1 cm requiring Mannitol administration. On [**2834-3-28**] Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was admitted to an outside hospital with acute coronary syndrome as he was having intermittent chest pain at rest.  He ruled out for an myocardial infarction and was taken to the catheterization lab on [**2834-3-29**].  During the catheterization all grafts were found and his coronary artery bypass graft was found to be patent, but there was a 70% circumflex stenosis and an 80% stenosis posterolateral branch and circumflex with a 70% stenosis between two lateral left ventricular branches of the circumflex. During catheterization patient became less responsive.  No intervention was performed.  After catheterization patient was noted not to be moving left arm.  Head CT was performed which showed a large right MCA stroke. On [**2834-3-30**] Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was intubated for airway protection given decreased mental status, nausea, vomiting, and a question of aspiration.  Neurologic exam at that time revealed left hemiplegia, eyes deviated to the right, probable field cut and .......... to the left side.  Head CT showed increased edema.  Patient was started on Mannitol as well as antibiotics for a possible pneumonia. From that date until transfer patient remained intubated, and head CT revealed a slightly increasing edema with a 1 cm midline shift as well as a right inferior posterior cerebellar infarct.  Mannitol and Lasix were continued. Patient was also started on tube feeds and given some free water boluses for hypernatremia of 150. He was transferred to [**Hospital6 253**] on [**2834-4-5**], intubated, for further management. 
Pt is a 69f with metastatic renal cell ca, cva, and a recent admission for GIB who presents with one week of fatigue and pallor and was found to anemic at 26.6 (last hct from discharge [**12-2**] was 30). She was recently admitted for [**Date range (1) 9763**] when her pcp found her to have a hct of 24. She had a negative ng lavage, guaiac negative, egd negative, colonoscopy negative, capsule endoscopy negative; her fe studies showed a ferritin > [**2753**], and the thought was that this was related to anemia of chronic disease. She felt better after her admission, with a "rosy" complexion; however, over the next few days she became increasingly pale and fatigued. On the day of presentation, she was confused, going into the wrong room at home, unable to distinguish between dreams/reality; in the ed, she was a&o and said she didn't feel confused, just that her thinking was "slow." She denies recent f/c, ha, focal weakness, lightheadeness, loc, vis changes, chest pain, sob, cough, abd pain, n/v/d/c, back pain, dysuria/hematuria. In the ED, she got 2units prbc and was seen by neurology. 
This is a 70 year old man with history of myotonic dystrophy and recent bronchitis who presents with dyspnea. He reports a nonproductive cough x 3-4 weeks. When it didn't improve, he went to his PCP and was started on azithromycin empirically for bronchitis about 2 weeks ago. He finished his Z-pack, but afterward his cough became worse. Two nights ago, he had difficulty sleeping and didn't use his bipap. He felt better the next morning, but that evening felt short of breath again and was gasping for air. He couldn't tolerate his bipap due to stuffy nose, and then had progressive dyspnea today. It became so bad he decided to come to the ED. . In the ED, he was initially found to be hypoxic room air to 77% initially. A NRB improved him to >90%, but he was switched to CPAP for improved oxygenation, but didn't tolerate it due to discomfort. He desatted to 75% on nonrebreather, and intubation was discussed. On retrial of CPAP, he improved his sats to >99? on 100% FiO2. He was given 500 mg PO levofloxacin and 40 mg IV lasix with 1500 cc urine out through the time he arrived on the floor. He was given 325 mg aspirin and started on a nitroglycerin drip for SBP aroun 200. He was admitted ot the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. 
Patient is an 82-year-old man without a past medical history except for longstanding asthma, who presents to the Emergency Department after having seen his primary care this morning, and noted to have a temperature of 103 F.  Patient reports that he was in his usual state of health last evening, however, but he awoke this morning feeling generally unwell and subsequently had an episode of nausea and vomiting with subjective fevers. Patient denies chills. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for chronic nonproductive cough. Negative for pleuritic chest pain, abdominal pain, dysuria, or frequency, diarrhea, or hematochezia.  He denies sick contacts or travel history.  He has had no hospitalizations since [**2555**] at which time he had resection of a distal pancreatic mass and splenectomy. In the Emergency Department, the patient's temperature was 101.6 with stable vital signs. PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 101.6, blood pressure 126/42, heart rate 67, respirations 18, and saturating 96% on room air.  Generally, the patient was in no acute distress.  HEENT exam was unremarkable.  He had no lymphadenopathy in the cervical or axillary regions.  Heart sounds were normal.  Lung exam was significant for coarse breath sounds.  Abdomen was benign.  Extremities:  He had trace to +1 edema bilaterally. LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 33.5 with 81% neutrophils, 12% bands, 6% lymphocytes, hematocrit 42.8, platelets 545.  Chem-7 was unremarkable.  Lactate was 4.4. Urinalysis was negative. Chest x-ray:  Negative for consolidation or effusion. Blood cultures:  Negative. BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit according to the MUST sepsis protocol.  No infectious source was found.  Patient's white blood cell count continued to trend down on ceftriaxone, which he was continued on for five days after which point he was changed to oral Levaquin for a total of 14-day course. Despite the diagnosis of fever of unknown origin, suspicion for endocarditis was extremely low, and transthoracic echocardiogram was also negative for vegetation.  Patient became afebrile two days after admission and continued to be afebrile throughout his hospital course. Lung nodule:  CT torso was done to evaluate potential abscesses, which could be the source of the patient's fever. Incidentally, it was noted that patient had a spiculated noncalcified pulmonary nodule measuring 1 cm in diameter from the left lung apex.  CT Surgery consulted during this admission, and recommended a repeat CT scan in one month with outpatient followup. Asthma/emphysema:  Patient was continued on his Flovent and Serevent.  He has no record of pulmonary function tests and this will be done as an outpatient. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Sepsis, fever of unknown origin. 2. Pulmonary nodule seen incidentally on CAT scan. FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient was instructed to followup with his primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2856**] in one week.  He was also instructed to have a repeat CAT scan on his chest in one month and this was scheduled for [**2559-2-27**].  He is also to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 173**], Cardiothoracic Surgery after this CT scan.  Lastly, he is to followup to get pulmonary function tests on [**2-21**]. DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  Patient was afebrile and clinically at his baseline. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Serevent 50 mcg one inhalation p.o. q.12h. 2. Flovent two puffs b.i.d. 3.

46 yo M with h/o heavy daily ETOH use, alcoholic hepatis, IVDU, paraplegia, ? h/o pancreatitis, who presented to ED today s/p fall from wheelchair with ? assault. Pt thinks he passed out but does not recall any details. In ED had a neg CT head and CXR and was being dischaged home, when he mentioned to SW that he had SI and wanted detox. The was found to be diaphoretic, tachycardic, tremulous without hallucinations; no LOC or sz. Was given a total of 170 mg IV Valium, thiamine, folate, MVT, 3L IVF and banana bag. Was initially hypothermic in ED (T 94): resolved with warming blanket Was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for observation. On arrival, states he is hurting all over without any particular localizing sxs. 
The patient is a 46 year old female with extensive ductal carcinoma in situ on the right breast, first noted on mammogram on [**3383-5-19**].  The patient underwent right breast biopsy on [**3383-6-13**], which showed ductal carcinoma in situ.  The patient presented for a right mastectomy with a TRAM flap reconstruction.  The patient has no family history of breast cancer. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  1.  Right breast biopsy.  2. Tonsillectomy. 
72yM with h/o mech aortic valve and atrial fibrillation on coumadin as well as history of recurrent bladder cancer (Transitional Ceel), status post TURBT on [**2950-7-31**]. His post op course was complicated by urinary retention requiring Foley replacement [**Date range (1) 9781**] with intermittent hematuria and passage of small clots since. Was admitted to urology service on [**8-18**] for this and underwent cystoscopy, fulguration, clot evacuation, and catheter exchange. Underwent two days of CBI with weaning and then had successful trial of foley removal. He came to the ED today with 3-4h h/o urinary retention, bladder spasms, and gross hematuria/clots. Patient denies other symptoms including fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, SOB, CP. Reports persisent dysuria since proceedure with one episode of urinary incontinence. . Urology saw pt in ED and 20French 3-way foley was placed and hand irrigated x2. CBI initiated but persistent light pink to fruit punch output. Noted to have 6pt Hct drop and ED reporting EKG changes with V3-V6 ST depressions in setting of elevated rates from RVR. Other vitals okay. Pt given benzos, morphine, oxybutin as well as 18L of CBI. Was continuing to have issues with clots and requiring high levels of nursing care so this, combined with Hct drop (although stable on recheck), and EKG changes prompted [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] admission after urology had previously accepted pt to the floor. . On ICU arrival pt in sporadic pain, but excruciating when present. CBI running with bloody fluid in bag. Urology manually irrigated when pt arrived to ICU. Urology potentially planning for OR in AM. Pt feeling okay inbetween pain spasms except for feeling tired. 
73yo male who underwent a restaging TUR bladder tumor on [**2951-5-28**].  The final result indicated carcinoma in situ with invasion into [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 9782**] nests but no muscle invasive disease. There was a question of a lamina propria invasion.  All of these factors point to a losing battle with intravesical immuno and chemotherapy, which we have been doing for over four years. He was therefore scheduled for cystectomy. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9789**] is a 73 year old Caucasian male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia who was in usual state of health until [**3003-7-13**], when he wanted to join a gym. Due to his age, he was requested to have a stress test which showed abnormal results, including regional wall motion abnormalities, severe hypokinesis in the anterior wall, and apex, and anterolateral central septal walls on the echocardiogram.  Due to the result of this echocardiogram, the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization [**7-27**], showing 90% proximal right coronary artery stenosis, diffuse disease in mid-RCA and 40% distal right coronary artery stenosis, 30% proximal left anterior descending stenoses, 90% mid-LAD stenosis and 60% distal left anterior descending stenosis.  There was also 90% stenosis in the diagonal branches.  For these lesions, the patient received PTCA with two stents placed in the right coronary artery, PTCA with Rotablator to the left anterior descending with two stents. During this procedure, the D1 branch was obstructed and required balloon and stenting. The patient tolerated his procedure well and was doing well after his catheterization until [**3003-11-20**], when he presented with a temperature of 101.0 F., to the Emergency Department with right lower quadrant abdominal pain similar to his diverticulitis which he has had before.  While drinking Baricon contrast in preparation for an abdominal CT scan in the Emergency Department, the patient developed 10 on 10 chest pain while he had no history of chest pain ever in the past, with a [**Street Address(2) 2023**] depressions in leads V3 to V6, [**Street Address(2) 7006**] depressions in leads II, III and AVF.  The patient was given an aspirin, 5 mg of intravenous Lopressor, he was heparinized and given three sublingual Nitroglycerin initially with resolution of pain. However, his pain recurred and his ST depressions became more pronounced.  The patient was rushed to the Catheterization Laboratory.  In the Catheterization Laboratory on [**3003-11-20**], the patient was found to have a cardiac output of 4.3, a pulmonary wedge pressure of 22 and a PA pressure of 42/22.  A study of the patient's coronaries showed mild disease of the left main coronary artery.  The left anterior descending had 40% proximal stenosis and 90% in-stent restenosis with a 99% ostial D1 disease.  The left circumflex was without critical disease.  The right coronary artery had a focal 90% in-stent restenosis.  The patient underwent PTCA of these lesions.  During the procedure, the patient became hypotensive requiring Dopamine for pressure support.  He also dropped his oxygen saturation transiently requiring urgent intubation.  This intubation was complicated by a lip laceration.  At this time, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed. Overall, the patient received intervention of a kissing balloon inflation in left anterior descending and D1 with 30% residual stenosis in D1 as well as a balloon in the right coronary artery with zero percent residual stenosis.  The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit following his catheterization for further care. 
She is a 51-year-old woman who was in her usual state of good health until 12:30 the day of admission when she developed an onset of severe headache and brief [**10-5**] minute episode of transient left upper extremity numbness.  The headache occurred while sitting at a desk. She drove herself home and family members then brought her to the [**Hospital6 4555**] where a head CT scan showed subarachnoid hemorrhage with blood in the basal cistern.  She denied nausea, vomiting, photophobia, diplopia, incontinence. 
Source : history is obtained from the patient's aide, [**Doctor First Name **]. Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9820**] is a 78 year old with a h/o stroke in [**2964**], afib on Coumadin, CAD s/p CABG x 2, hypertension, and diabetes, who presents from home with altered mental status.  Patient's aid saw her this morning at 11:30AM and was normal.  She came back around noon, knocked on the door and there was no response.  She then went to a neighbor to get the spare key.  She found her on the couch saying that she was, "good, fine, I'm okay" in Russian but the aid theought she was obviously not fine.  EMS was called and she was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Since arrival, she was intially able to mostly cooperate with the exam, answering questions about her medical history and following commands.  Her heart rate is 89 and SBP 138.  She was 94% on room air.  Head CT was done, which shows a likely right MCA infarct.  Several hours later, she started desaturating and is on a nonrebreather with sats in the 90s.  She then became tachycardic to the 140s, wide complex, appearing to be SVT with abberancy. She has been started on Amiodarone drip.  On exam, she also became more somnolent. At baseline, the aid states that she is independent with most of her ADLs except that she is currently having more memory troubles.  She has some residual left sided weakness from the old stroke but has recovered well. She ambulates with a walker. In review of systems, she has been otherwise doing well. In the ED, she is complaining of some trouble breathing and some chest pain. 
This 63 year old white male has known coronary artery disease, having undergone stents in [**2877**] and [**2881**].  Over the past month he has had postprandial angina and with exercise.  A stress test was positive and catheterization revealed an 80% left main stenosis, triple vessel disease and in-stent stenosis at [**Hospital 9826**].  He was transferred for revascularization. 
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of Crohns who was recently discharged from the ACS service ([**2633-6-28**]) after a five day stay for conservative managment of a small bowel obstruction.  She presents now reporting abdominal pain since early this morning which woke her from sleep.  Pain is diffuse and she cannot tell if abdomen feels distended or not.  She had some nausea and one episodes of emesis this morning, but is no longer nauseous now.  She did have one bowel movement this morning which was loose and passed some flatus.  She has not been eating much in the past several works and reports having no appetite. She also reports an associated twenty pound weight loss. 
This is a 54 year-old female with h/o lung CA s/p resection now with 1 week of dry cough, coryza, fever to 103, and malaise, presented initially to [**Hospital 2893**] where she was given levofloxacin and then transferred here at family's request. Pt is [**Name (NI) 589**] speaking only and refused to speak with hospital interpreter; history is obtained from sister. . In the ED, VS were afebrile, 87, 128/71, 20, 98% NRB; desat to 85% on RA. Received CTX in [**Hospital1 18**] ED and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for high O2 requirement. . ROS: + fever, cough, stuffy nose, muscle aches. - diarrhea. 1 episode of BRBPR, streak on toilet paper, in last week. 
57 year old woman admitted after a fall on her left side the morning of admission. The patient says that she got out of bed, felt some mild palpitations and lightheadedness and then lost consciousness and fell. The patient thinks that she was on the ground for a few seconds and then woke up. The patient was able to crawl back to bed and then ambulate slightly with her walker, but she could not weight bear on her left leg. In the ED, initial vital signs: 98.4 116 164/96 16 96% RA, the patient had a work-up notable for negative head/neck CT and hip films showing a left greater trochanteric fracture. She was evaluated by orthopaedics who plan to operate, but requested work-up of the etiology of her fall prior to surgery. Currently the patient is interviewed and collateral information obtained from sister, the health care proxy. The patient's story has changed several times since admission, but she states she was getting out of bed to her walker, when she had some unbalance, which chronically is an issue related to her left leg, and she fell.

In the ED inital vitals were 98, 80, 90/51, 78/56 sitting up, 16, 100% on RA.  She triggered on arrival to the ER for hypotension.  Her initial exam was notable for evidence of dehydration, bedside ultrasound showed an IVC that collapsed with respiration.  Labs were notable for a Cr of 2.3 (unknown baseline), Ca of 11.1, white count of 13.6 with 79% neutrophils, no bands and urinalysis with small leuk, few bacteria and 4 WBC's.  EKG was NSR at 79bpm, with TWI in III.  Chest x-ray with no infiltrates.  She was given 5L NS and her blood pressures remained in the 90's systolic, zofran for nausea and calcium gluconate for question of over beta blockade.  VS on transfer: 92/48, 86, 21, 96% on RA. . On arrival to the ICU her initial VS were: 97.5, 86, 107/60, 10, 99% on RA.  She currently says that she feels much better, but that her abdomen is sore from the vomiting but otherwise feels well. 
HPI: Ms [**Known patient lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with h/o CHF (diastolic dysfunction), CAD, CKD, PAFib, COPD/asthma who presents with tachypnea and hypoxia.  Pt was brought in by EMS.  Per EMS she was feeling lousy over past few days with progressive SOB and cough starting 1 day prior to presentation. . In the ED she was found to be tachypneic to 40s with sats as low as 80%.  She denied CP.  Her code status was confirmed as full. She was intubated and placed on Midazolam gtt and Fentanyl boluses.  ABG 7.27/50/172/24 intubated on 100% FiO2.  Of note she was last intubated for respiratory failure in [**2680-2-21**] thought to be secondary to PNA, COPD exacerbation, and CHF. . She was initially placed on a nitro gtt.  Her lactate was elevated at 3.8 and a code sepsis was called.  IJ placed with checklist preformed.  She was given CTX 1 gm and Azithromycin IV.  The nitro gtt was stopped.  Her SBP then dropped to the 70's and she was started on Neosynephrine with little effect, changed to levophed.  CVP ranged from [**7-2**].  SVO2 72%.  She received Aspirin, Furosemide 100mg, and Dexamethasone 4MG. First set of cardiac enzymes were negative.  Blood and urine cultures were sent.  UA with occ bacteria, 500 protein, o/w negative.

A 68 year-old female with history of bilateral breast cancer and metastatic kidney cancer, with extensive osseous and pulmonary metastases presented with chronic and acute lower back pain and hip pain.  She has chronic lower pain and b/l hip pain for 2 years.  The pain has gotten worse over the past one month.  The pain was constant and [**9-26**] in intensity.  Any movement would aggravate the pain and only pain med would relieve the pain. Because of the pain, she underwent a CT of abd and pelvis on [**2867-9-7**], which found that dramatic increase in overall tumor burden and  metastatic disease at T11/T12 results in focal spinal instability with a invasion of the spinal canal with nearly 50% canal narrowing and greater than 50% vertebral body involvement. She denied focalized weakness, numbness, fecal or urine incontinence, buttock area numbness, or urine retention.  However, she has constipated over the past one week. Review of Systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies blurry vision, diplopia, loss of vision, photophobia. Denies  sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations, lower extremity edema. Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezes. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, melena, hematemesis, hematochezia. Denies rashes or skin breakdown. No numbness/tingling in extremities. All other systems negative. 
The patient is a 68 year-old female with history of bilateral breast cancer and metastatic kidney cancer, with extensive osseous and pulmonary metastases, who was discharged to NH from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2867-9-22**] after an admission during which she was diagnosed with extensive bony metastasis, and was treated with T9-L1 posterior fusion for unstable T11 metastasis.  Reportedly, she developed fever and was found to have decreased oxygen saturation to 80s at room air at the NH and some confusion and was transferred to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**].  She had denied chest pain, and reported mild sob.  Denied abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria.  Denied calf pain.  She had been minimally mobile at NH and was taking heparin SQ TID for DVT prophylaxis. Her VS in the ED were: 99.6 (Tm:101),124/91, 20, 96% 4L Nasal Cannula. A UA was abnormal.  And she had an elevated WBC to 15. She had a head CT that did not show evidence of acute CVA. Unfortunately due to IV access issues (it could not be determined whether she had a power port), she could not obtain a CT chest with contrast to evaluate for PE.  But was empirically treated with therapeutic dose of lovenox after a D-dimer was found to be mildly elevated.  A chest CXR showed worsening pul edema, but given extensive lung mets, a consolidative process could not be ruled out.  She was empirically started on vancomycin and cefepime for UTI as well as possible pneumonia, and admitted to the floor. Review of Systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies blurry vision, diplopia, loss of vision, photophobia.

He describes initial pain starting 4 days prior to admission. He desribes sharp chest pain located in the center of his chest that occurred while at rest and resolved spontaneously. He has had continued shortness of breath. Then on wednesday (3 days prior to admission) he awakened in the morning with severe pressure in his chest. The pain was severe for approximately an hour and then also resolved. Since then he has had on and off severe dull, very heavy chest pain. It again recurred this morning and has persisted. Other qualities to the pain are that it is better with sitting up and worse with lying flat, does not radiate to the back, and somewhat worse with deep breaths and coughing. During the last few days, he has had brief periods of activity intermittent with dyspnea on exertion. However, today he was so fatigued that he was unable to let his friend into his house. Also he has had a cough for approximately 2-3 days and increasing sputum. Initially the sputum was lime green, but now has bloody streaks (this AM with increased blood).

69 year old woman with a history of breast and renal cell carcinoma  with metastasis into the lungs and bone and recent CVA in [**2867-6-17**]. Pt had been complaining of several days of shortness of breath at her rehab facility which had progressively been getting worse. She had an outpatient CT scan today to evaluate for recollection of recently drained pleural effusion.  CT scan today reveal large right sided pneumothorax, thought to be causing her tachycardia and increased shortness of breath.  Per her son, she has not experienced fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. . In the ED inital vitals were,  97.7 110 92/57 20 90% RA.

She was noted to have RCC mets to the lung in [**2864**]. She has undergone numerous radiation and chemotherapy treatments. She had a CT scan on [**2867-9-7**] which showed cord compression. She had cord stablization surgery on [**9-15**] which was complicated by continued serous drainage from her back and recurrent pleural effusion. Her pleural fluid grew MRSA and she was started on IV vancomycin. It is thought that her previous surgical site is communicating with her pleural fluid and may have been the cause of her pneumothorax. . On the floor, patient states that she is still short of breath but may be her her baseline. She is very tired and would like to be left alone. . Review of systems: (+) Per HPI, back pain at site of previous surgery, + anxiety, did have urinary retention following back surgery - she has had foley removed for 2 days and has been voiding spontaneously though cannot get to the bathroom independently so she is wearing diapers.

65F with history of sciatica and chronic low back pain, presenting to [**Hospital3 10179**] hospital with worsening back pain, now admit to MICU with altered mental status, renal failure and multiple epidural abcesses.  She began to feel ill one week ago when she acutely felt "awful" with low-grade fevers, back pain and thought she had the flu.  She went to the ED, where she was treated with ibuprofen, Vicodin and Tamiflu.  She stayed home for the rest of the week resting her back, until the pain worsened on Friday and she went to see her PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was diagnosed with sciatica and sent home with Percocet.  Over Saturday and Sunday she became increasingly somnolent, sleeping excessively and refusing to eat.  Initially she would still drink water through a straw, but stopped doing that Sunday.  Her husband called the [**Name (NI) **] for advice, and was told to call 911.  She had not complained specifically of headaches and he did not notice photophobia or neck stiffness.  She may have been urinating less, but did not complain of dysuria. EMS arrived to find her supine on the couch complaining of back pain.  In the OSH ED her VS were T 99.6, HR 120, BP 132/68, 91% on RA.   Given ceftriaxone, flagyl, clindamycin, and vancomycin. Episode of transient tachycardia to 120s that resolved with fluids.  Found to have new ARF, a positive UA and leukocytosis to 20K with 14% bands.

The patient is a 71 year old Vietnamese female with a past medical history significant for hypertension who was transferred from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10184**] Hospital in [**State 2704**] for Intensive Care Unit management.  The patient originally presented to the outside hospital on [**7-25**], noting chest heaviness that began that morning. The chest pain progressively worsened throughout the day. She presented to the Emergency Department that afternoon at 2.  Her initial electrocardiogram showed ST elevations in the inferior leads consistent with an acute inferior myocardial infarction.  She also had some bradycardia and hypertension along with transient high-grade heartblock.  She received thrombolytic with reperfusion documented within 30 minutes. Her ST segment elevation resolved and the patient was painfree and kept on intravenous heparin.  Later that evening/early morning at 2 AM she was noted to have acute mental status changes.  Head computerized tomography scan showed intracranial hemorrhage primarily in the third and fourth ventricles extending into the lateral ventricles, resulting in mild hydrocephaly.  She was emergently given fresh frozen plasma and Protamine for heparin reversal. Neurosurgery was consulted and placed a ventriculostomy with drainage tube to monitor her intracranial pressure.  The patient was noted to be comatose and unresponsive at the time of bleed.  She was intubated for airway protection. Throughout the hospitalization she had minimal neurological improvement.  She had occasional movement of her head to the left, positive corneal reflexes, positive Doll's eyes and pupils equal and reactive to light with minimal withdrawal of the pain.  Intracranial pressure was monitored and on [**7-30**] with the intracranial pressure 1315, the ventriculoscopy drain was removed.  The patient's course at the outside hospital was also complicated by low-grade fevers for which she was placed on Ancef.  The family chose to transfer the patient to [**Hospital6 253**] for geographical reasons, as the patient is originally from [**Location (un) 86**] and has multiple family members living in the [**Name (NI) 86**] area.  The patient arrived via ambulance transport and was transferred the evening of [**7-30**]. 
Patient is a 50M who had been suffering with intermittitant disequilibrium 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10190**] is a 50 year old male with grade 1 pilocytic astrocytoma s/p recent suboccipital carniotomy brought to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 **] center due to tachycardia and dyspnea noted by rehab radiology faculty. His post-cramotomy ([**10-5**]) course was complicated by repeat craniotomy ([**10-11**]) for re-bleeding and residual mass as well as by RLL pneumonia (completed 7 day course on Levofloxacin). He was discharged to rehab on dilantin ppx and DVT prophylaxis (heparin 5000 U SC TID, originally written on [**10-5**] on initial admit). Following d/c from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**10-17**] and prior to this admission, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10190**] reports minimal ambulation and activity (without HA, nausea, vomiting, or palpitations) with severe R calf pain and dyspnea while getting physical therapy at rehab that morning. At that time he was noted to have LE swelling, tachycardia, and dyspnea. Bilateral DVT's were discovered on ultrasound ([**10-22**]) and Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10190**] was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. In the ED, vitals were T 97.8 HR 119 BP 129/97 RR 24 SaO2 98%RA. Chest CT confirmed massive bilateral PEs. He was evaluated by his neurosurgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who recommended starting heparin at 1000 units/hour without bolus and repeating a head CT once the patient was therapeutic (PTT 50-70). He also advised avoiding TPA. Vascular was also consulted in case of emergent embolectomy. He was transfered to the MICU. ECHO at that time showed RV free wall hypokinesis and abnormal septal motion with a dilated RV. He remained on [**1-29**] L nc with oxygen sats > 95%. He had an IVC filter placed by the vascular team through a right IJ approach. Head CT (once PTT > 50) showed no acute bleeding. On admission to the ED, his wife noted that his right facial droop and dyarthria have been improving. He has also recently had a corneal abrasion [**1-28**] being unable to close his right eye. On admission to the [**Hospital **] medical service his vitals were T 97.7 HR 105, BP 124/82 R 24 SaO2 97%RA. Physical exam was notable for reduced lung sounds at the bases bilaterally (L>R) with inspiratory wheezes and mild crackles appreciated at the mid right throax and lower left lung base respectively. 
This is a 77-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with complaints of increasing cough, dyspnea and decreased intakes starting approximately three days prior to admission.  Per his wife, he had a temperature of 100?????? in the morning and shaking chills, cough productive of copious yellow sputum. At baseline, has cough productive of white sputum.  He is homebound and has had significant decline in his respiratory status over the past three months.  He becomes quite dyspneic on even minimal ambulation.  He uses 2 liters of oxygen at home, has a 60 pack year history of smoking and quit in [**3023**]. He reports that the severity of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease waxes and wanes and that he does not feel worse the day of admission than during his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations.  He reports a history of multiple chronic obstructive pulmonary disease examinations at other hospitals, but that he has never been intubated before.  In the Emergency Room, he was given 125 mg of intravenous Solu-Medrol and levofloxacin.  In the Emergency Department, he had an electrocardiogram that initially showed sinus tachycardia, but then appeared to be atrial fibrillation in the 170s.  He was given a Diltiazem bolus and started on a Diltiazem drip. 
Patient presents with nearly a 1 week course of nausea, vomiting and worsening abdominal pain, presented to the ER. He received a CAT scan that was consistent with a high-grade small bowel obstruction. The patient preoperatively underwent aggressive resuscitation with IV fluids and electrolyte corrections with potassium and magnesium. Patient's creatinine improved from a creatinine of 3 to 1.7, and the potassium also corrected from 2.7 to 3.1. A central line was placed for resuscitation. The patient consented for exploratory laparotomy, possible bowel resection, possible ostomy. The 
The pt is a 43 yo female w/ [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10201**] [**Last Name (un) 2855**], s/p thymectomy for thymoma in [**2632**] which was found to be metastatic to lung and abdomen.  The pt now presents w/ several weeks of tiredness, several days of dyspnea on exertion, and 1 day of diplopia.  The pt first started feeling tired several wks ago after undergoing 2 biopsies for staging of her thymoma metastes ([**8-23**]).  The tiredness progressed over the next few wks.  Several days ago, the pt then noticed that she became short of breath after walking quickly.  She describes her sensation of dyspnea as "not having enough air" and feeling tired.  Yesterday, she became increasingly short of breath w/ less exertion, e.g. going up stairs, cleaning the kitchen, and talking; she also required 2 pillows to go to sleep last night due to orthopnea.  Yesterday, she also noted that her R eye felt "heavy", i.e. was difficult to open, and that she was seeing double, ie.. 2 objects side-by-side.  The double vision occurred at various times during the day, corresponding to when the pt felt tired, and was worse w/ horizontal gaze and looking at far versus near objects.  The pt denied any associated eye pain and said her L eye felt normal. This morning, the pt's diplopia had resolved, but she continued to be short of breath w/ minimal exertion, e.g. talking in short sentences, so she came to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. . The pt had similar sx of tiredness and diplopia 3y ago (but never dyspnea) and was subsequently diagnosed w/ MG.  At the time of dx, the pt was found to have a thymoma, so per Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 939**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 940**], the pt underwent induction of chemoradiotherapy followed by median sternotomy and anterior thymic resection; she was also found at that time to have metastases to the L pleura. Following the initial surgery in [**2632**], the pt remained asymptomatic.  However, despite subsequent trials of chemotherapy, her metastatic disease continued to progress, spreading to the L lung and possibly L retroperitoneum.  In [**8-23**], the pt underwent several staging biopsies of the metastases in the L lung and a suspicious L suprarenal mass (pathology pending).  Given the extent of the pt's disease, the pt discussed her treatment options w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 940**] and her oncologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 547**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and she has decided to undergo surgery (L extrapleural pneumonectomy w/ additional resection of L suprarenal mass).  Her surgery is scheduled for this Weds, [**2635-11-4**].  Given her current sx, the pt is concerned about how she will be able to handle the surgery, but she and her husband express a strong desire to go ahead with the surgery, either on the scheduled day or as soon as her health would allow. . ROS: Pt noted intermittent palpitations w/ fast walking associated w/ the recent SOB described above.  Pt also notes mild abdominal pain since her bx in [**8-23**]; immediately after the procedure, the pt says she developed an "infection" involving fever and "yellowish stuff" draining from her umbilicus; the fever and discharge have since resolved, but mild pain persists, intermittent and sharp in the epigastric/LLQ area "right under the skin."  Additionally, the pt denies recent depression or anxiety but says that she feels "very sad" whenever she thinks about her children (9y, 11y), because "they are so young and they need me still." . Aside from the sx above, the pt says her health has been good. The pt denies fever (except as above), chills, sick contacts, recent URI, HA, dizziness, difficulty chewing or swallowing, dysarthria, neck pain/stiffness, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain (except as above), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, difficulty voiding, extremity pain/focal weakness/numbness/tingling.

He has been on Plavix 75 mg daily and full dose Aspirin.  However, on Tuesday, 10 days prior to presentation, the patient underwent a lithotripsy for kidney stones with placement of a ureteral stent and foley bag and his Plavix was held.  He is currently 10 days off Plavix with his cardiologist and urologist both aware. . The patient reports his current symptoms began this morning when he developed sudden onset, dull, substernal chest pain while walking at a leisurely pace at an automobile dealership.  The pain was associated with diaphoresis, and subsequently developed nausea while being transported to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  His symptoms were noted to be different than his prior anginal symptoms of epigastric pain.  He presented to a fire station where they gave him full dose aspirin and transported him to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  The patient reports he began developing radiating left arm pain and precordial pain when he reached the ED. Cardiology was consulted and recommended Heparin gtt, Plavix load, and Nitro gtt titrated to pain. Cardiac surgery was consulted for evaluation of coronary artery revascularization. 
Patient is a 51-year-old G0 who presented with postmenopausal bleeding, starting after 12 months of amenorrhea.  A pelvic ultrasound on [**7-18**] of [**3076**] at Valley Medical Group showed two echogenic structures in the lower uterine segment suggesting polyps, normal ovaries, endometrial stripe was 4.5 mm.  An endometrial biopsy on [**3077-7-19**] was inactive endometrium and a pap smear was within normal limits.  A hysteroscopy dilatation and curettage on [**9-10**] showed an atypical polypoid adenomyoma.  Patient elected for definitive treatment. Although there are few cases reported, this is probably a precancerous lesion, so a total abdominal hysterectomy bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was warranted.  Patient was consented.

This is a 76-year-old male with severe coronary artery disease involving three vessels, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2692**], and multiple follow-up catheterizations who presented to [**Hospital1 188**] for elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent of the right coronary artery. Since the patient's 4-vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2692**] he has had recurrent exertional angina that is relieved by rest and nitroglycerin.  He has had six catheterizations since the surgery, but no interventions.  His most recent catheterization was in [**2698-5-8**] that showed an ejection fraction of 73%, mild inferobasal hypokinesis, severe 3-vessel disease with 60% to 80% proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion, and complete distal left anterior descending artery occlusion, diffuse left circumflex disease with middle stenosis of approximately 50%, with 90% stenosis at third obtuse marginal, and significant right coronary artery disease with serial 70% stenoses proximal and midway through the vessel as well as total occlusion of the distal third of the right coronary artery.  These findings represented essentially no change since the prior study performed in [**2696**]. Also, the patient had a stress thallium in [**2698-5-8**] that showed defects in an inferoapical distribution as well as with upper septal defects.  This was worse than the prior test which was performed one year earlier. Therefore, he was admitted for elective catheterization and right coronary artery intervention. During his cardiac catheterization an right coronary artery stent was placed that resulted in a perforation of the middle right coronary artery.  He remained hemodynamically stable. A [**Doctor First Name **]-Med covered stent was placed with filling of the perforation.  Subsequently, a small guide wire perforation was noted in the distal posterior descending artery.  This was treated with reversal of heparin and prolonged balloon inflations. A post procedure echocardiogram was performed that showed no pericardial effusion. The patient was brought to the holding area where approximately half an hour after the procedure he experienced substernal chest pain, and electrocardiogram at that time revealed ST elevations in leads V1 through V3.  He was brought back to the catheterization laboratory where he underwent an additional catheterization.  A total right coronary artery stent occlusion was seen.  A stent thrombectomy was performed with Angio-Jet and proximal and distal stents were placed.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and given the complicated procedure he was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for observation and for monitoring for possible development of tamponade in the setting of coronary vessel rupture.

She states they occur roughly weekly, although she can go for longer periods without one. She states they were worse when she had been simultaneously on chemotherapy until [**2807**], and then presented sometimes as frank syncope. More recently however, she denies any frank syncopal episodoes. She states that sometimes these episodes are accompanied by a band-like headache around her head, she she states that if she gets that headache first, it is a cue for her to sit down. She states that these headaches are different that her migraines, which are preceded by an aura of funny smells and flashing lights.

He also reports having lots of indigestion lately. In the ED, his initial vitals were 97.2 52 130/71 18 99% 2L. Pt had troponin < 0.01 and was sent for nuclear stress test, which showed a reversible, large, moderate severity perfusion defect involving the PDA/OM territory, and he was admitted for PCI. Ultimately, he was evaluated and referred for surgery. 
This is a 60 year old woman with a history of Stage 3A nonsmall cell lung cancer, status post right pneumonectomy whose medical course was further complicated by bronchopleural fistula and development of empyema in the pneumonectomy cavity.  She was also status post rib resection and tube drainage.  She has also had stenosis of her left main stem bronchus for which she had stent placed.  She has had multiple episodes of pneumonia/bronchitis with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the past and most recently with Pseudomonas.  Her course has also been complicated by bronchopleural fistula.  Over the past three days the patient has experienced increasing shortness of breath and secretions.  She denies fevers, chills or chest pains.  She was admitted to computerized tomography scan on [**1-7**] for rigid bronchoscopy.  Following the bronchoscopy in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit she was complaining of increased shortness of breath.  She was treated with nebulizers.  She continued to experience increased secretions and respiratory distress over night and was taken for an urgent rebronchoscopy, both flexible and rigid.  She was found to have a patent left main stem with moderate secretions.  The stent was removed and a biopsy was done around the site to rule out recurrent cancer.  There was also noticed to be a 2 mm right posterior fistula consistent with her bronchopleural fistula.  This was sealed with fibrin glue.  Following the procedure she continued to have large amount of secretions and respiratory distress and was ultimately intubated. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial examination prior to transfer to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit she was sedated but reactive in no acute distress.  She was intubated.  Her vital signs revealed temperature of 98.9??????, heartrate of 108, respiratory rate of 12, and blood pressure 92/61 with an oxygen saturation of 98%.  Her neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.  Her chest had loud upper respiratory sounds but was clear at the left base.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub or gallop and slightly tachycardiac.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities revealed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema. LABORATORY DATA:  Significant laboratory data reveals an admission white blood cell count of 11.9, hematocrit 30.9, and platelets 522.  Chem-7 revealed a sodium of 143, potassium 4.2, chloride 106, bicarbonate 26, BUN 20, creatinine 0.8.  Her arterial blood gases immediately prior to intubation was 7.23/66/64.  Bronchial washings from her initial rigid bronchoscopy showed 3+ polymorphonucleocytes and 4+ gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters with heavy growth of Staphylococcus aureus. HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit where she was watched carefully and sources for her respiratory distress were investigated.  She had a good oxygenation, adequate ventilation and minimal secretions throughout her stay.  It was felt that her failure to wean off of the ventilator may have been related to anxiety.  For this she was given Ativan and Roxicodone as needed as she takes similar medicines at home.  She underwent bronchoscopy on at least a couple of occasions to verify that secretions were adequate and there was no mucous plugging or other explanation for why she might be failing extubation, weaning. These studies revealed no clear reason for why she should be having difficulty weaning from the ventilator.  She was also started on Ceftazidime and Vancomycin given the presence of both Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas in her sputum.  While it is quite likely that these are both colonizers given the heavy secretions, it was thought to treat empirically on the chance that a tracheobronchitis may be contributing to difficulty in weaning her from the ventilator.  From a cardiovascular perspective her cardiac enzymes were cycled to rule out the possibility of myocardial infarction.  She remained with a lowgrade tachycardia throughout her hospital course. Evidently she tends to be tachycardiac at baseline, even at home.  Nevertheless, chest computerized tomography scan was obtained with angiography to rule out pulmonary embolus.  The study was also negative. On [**1-12**], the patient was tolerating minimal ventilatory support and was extubated.  However, after two hours she was clearly in a significant amount of distress, becoming red in the face, very uncomfortable and not moving 
78 yo M with h/o CIDP, HTN, depression p/w one day of altered mental status. Per the pt's daughters he was in his usual state of health last night. He was interactive, conversing with them, functioning at his baseline. However, this morning the pt was found to be behaving oddly. He was found to be sitting on his bed. His speech was garbled and nonsensical. He collapsed, but his daughter slid him down to the floor without him hitting his head. He was incontinent of urine and was moving his hands as if trying to perform some function but no overt T-C movements were noted. EMS was called. . The pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 614**]. There he was found to be afebrile, have SBPs in the 140s-150s, and an irregular HR in the 110s-120s. He was given lopressor 5 mg X2 with control of his HR. Because of increasing agitation he was given ativan 1mg x 3 and 2mg x 1 and haldol 5mg x 2. CT head there was negative. LP demonstrated with WBC 0 and RBC 5, protein 61 and glucose 55. Pt was given acyclovir 800 mg IV X1 and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. . In the ED here pt was found to have temp to 101, 215/108, HR 149, rr 18, sat 98%. Pt given lopressor 5mg IV X2 with better rate control. Given ativan 2 mg IV X1 for agitation. CTX 2 gm IV X1. ASA 325 mg. Neuro evaluated pt and were concerned about sz vs. stroke--recommended MRI/A head/neck for further eval as well as EEG. . Pt transferred to MICU for further management and observation. 
37 yo Egyptian woman with likely myotonic dystrophy and ?left ovarian cancer presenting after cath with right femoral artery thrombosis. Pt was in [**Country 3349**] for last two and a half months and c/o dizziness and lightheadedness, worse when becoming upright from a supine position.  She also had nausea, vomiting, and a 10 pound weight loss.  Pt was diagnosed and treated for E. Histolytica in [**Country 3349**]. She also c/o sharp left sided and epigastric pain. Cardiovascularly, she c/o occassional palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath, all self-resolving.  Pt reports heavy menses, ~40pad over 7 days, with significant pain requiring two bottles of ibuprofen, all unchanged over last several years. Pt has an abnormal EKG with multiple PVC's, and a recent abnormal stress test with decreasing BP upon exercise with possible anginal symptoms.  Echo showed global hypokinesis with slightly decreased EF of 40-50%. Recent GI workup removed two adenomas during colonoscopy, and diagnosed gastritis upon EGD. Recent gyn workup revealed 10 x 8cm left ovarian mass with elevated CA-125.  Pt is begin followed by Ob/Gyn with plans for excision in near future. Recent neuro workup raised question of myotonic dystrophy, which seems likely. Pt was cathed today for abnormal EKG and stress test, finding clean coronaries.  Cath was complicated by right superficial femoral artery thrombosis, s/p lysis. 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 11716**] is a 40 yo female with a history of HIV (last CD4 89 on [**2901-12-13**]) , also with ESRD on hemodialysis s/p left AV fistula in [**2895**] converted to AV graft in [**2897**], with a history of multiple prior infections requiring excision and revision.

64 year old with known moderate 3 vessel coronary artery disease since '[**01**] who has been treated medically since that time, underwent preoperative evaluation for hand surgery where he disclosed he was experiencing exertional chest pain. He was then referred for surgical coronary revascularization with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]. 
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, status post a prolonged hospitalization, discharged on [**2612-7-16**] for recurrent infection of sacral decubitus with osteomyelitis.  The complete an 8-week course). The patient returned to the Emergency Department on the day of admission with a change in mental status.  She had decreased alertness, decreased ability to converse, and decreased oral intake.  The patient also complained of increased pain in her right foot requiring higher doses of In the Emergency Department, the patient's oxygen saturation pressure dropped to 69/34.  The patient was intubated, started on pressors, and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, she was stabilized, extubated, and weaned off pressors.  She was transferred to the floor for a workup of her various medical problems. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 64 year-old gentleman who presents for resection of melanoma.  He originally had a melanoma excised from his back quite awhile ago, which was reported to have had positive margins at an outside facility.  The purpose of this admission was more extensive excision of his back to achieve negative margins as well as to excise inguinal lymph nodes, which have become palpable and have been thought to represent metastatic disease. 
This is a 58 year old gentleman who fell in his home on [**11-14**], with questionable loss of consciousness and was seen at [**Hospital3 7272**].  The patient had an initial trauma evaluation and was noted to have raccoon eyes and left hemotympanum.  He was moving all fours and was hemodynamically stable.  He had a left chest tube placed at [**Hospital1 3546**] for hemothorax.  He was then transferred to the [**Hospital6 253**] for additional evaluation workup. There was no known past medical history, no home medications and no known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or alcohol. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initial vital signs were blood pressure 133/81, heartrate 98, respiratory rate 21, saturation 96% on room air.  On initial examination he had equal, round and reactive pupils, bilateral raccoon eyes and left hemotympanum.  His lungsounds were clear bilaterally with somewhat coarse breathsounds at the left side.  Heart was regular rate, S1 and S2.  On logroll, no areas of tenderness or stepoff were noted along the spine.  He had a soft, nontender, nondistended abdomen.  On rectal there was normal tone and guaiac negative brown stool.  Lower extremities were warm and well perfused, with palpable pulses and no gross deformities.  The left elbow was noted to be tender with no deformity.  He was moving all fours and was oriented times three. LABORATORY DATA:  Initial laboratory work was as follows - Complete blood count, white count 14.8, hematocrit 42.6, platelet count 222.  Chem-7, sodium 144, potassium 4.3, chloride 109, carbon dioxide 26, BUN 16, creatinine 0.7, and glucose 156.  Coagulation screen, PT 12.8, PTT 22.7, INR 1.0, lactate was 2.1.  Serum toxicology screen was positive for opiates as well as benzodiazepines.  Urinalysis was negative. Imaging - Trauma chest x-ray showed left-sided rib fractures at a left chest tube with appropriate positioning, no pneumothorax appreciated.  Coarse appearance of the pulmonary parenchyma which may be due to aspiration versus technique. Pelvis film shows no fractures.  Noncontrast head computerized tomography scan showed extensive subarachnoid bleb within the right frontal lobe sulci and right sylvian fissure.  There was accompanying hemorrhagic contusion in the adjacent portions of the right frontal and temporal lobes. There was a small adjacent subdural near the right pterion. Moderate compression of the right lateral ventricle was noted as well as a few mm of leftward shift at the third ventricle. There was probable hemorrhagic content within the left maxillary sinus and left sphenoid air cell.  The left tympanic cavity and external auditory canal were filled with soft tissue density.  A small amount of emphysema was noted within the left masticator space.  A lesion of the left superior ophthalmic vein was noted.  This finding in addition to some bulging in the left cavernous sinus was suspicious for the presence of a left carotid cavernous fistula. Impression of the computerized tomography scan was extensive intracranial hemorrhage as well as probable skull base fractures with findings suspicious for the presence of a left carotid cavernous fistula.  Computerized tomography scan of the facial bones and base of the skull showed a linear fracture of the mastoid and petrous portions of the left temporal bone.  There was also subtle fracture in the region of the pterygoid plates and left inferior lateral aspect of the sphenoid sinus.  There was a small fracture of the posterior aspect of the left maxillary sinus.  The patient had magnetic resonance imaging scan/magnetic resonance angiography of the head which showed bilateral dilation of the superior ophthalmic veins, but no distinct carotid cavernous fistula.  This study was followed up with four vessel angiogram which was negative.  Other injuries noted during radiologic examination included a left C7 transverse process fracture, a T2 spinous process fracture, and a left maldisplaced acromion fracture. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Trauma Intensive Care Unit with q. one hour neurologic checks.  He was loaded with Dilantin and his blood pressure was closely monitored with a goal systolic below 140.  His coagulation studies were followed with a goal INR below 1.3.  His head bleeds were followed with serial computerized tomography scan.  The amount of intravenous fluids was carefully limited to prevent cerebellar edema.  In the unit he was started on Decadron 6 intravenously q. 6.  He was also started on 
83 year old woman with history of CAD, hypertension, atrial fibrillation on dabigatran, osteoarthritis, hyperlipidemia, thyroid cancer who presents with BRBPR and melena since 1pm today. The patient states she felt "cold and clammy," although without fevers just before starting to have bowel movements at 1pm. She described the bowel movement as dark black with bright red blood filling the toilet bowl. She developed sharp substernal chest pain with radiation to her left shoulder during this first episode; she did not feel it was like her MIs in the distant past. This resolved after two sublingual NTG and patient also has nitroglycerin patch. The patient had another bloody and melanotic bowel movement at 3:30pm, none since. No abdominal pain associated with this, no light headedness or dizzyness, no presyncopal symptoms/syncope, nausea/vomiting. She did feel generally weak. . In the ED, initial VS were T97.7, HR78, BP139/74, RR18, 98% on RA. Two large bore PIVs were placed. The patient did not have any more bloody or melanotic stools, no hematemesis. Labs showed INR 1.9 and Hct 29, down from 45 (prior from [**2795**]). Anoscopy revealed moderate bright red blood in rectal vault without visibly active bleeding, +external hemorrhoids, no internal fissues/polyps. NG lavage initially passed clotted blood (50cc of normal saline input) and eventually cleared with 500cc lavage. NGT kept in. Foley placed. pRBC transfusion started with type and cross. Toxicology was consulted and recommended supportive care because dabigatran can not be reversed except with dialysis. They felt the drug will be excreted fairly rapidly (renally cleared) in patients with normal renal function. PT/PTT will normallly be prolonged. GI was also consulted and given dabigatran as likely precipitating factor and +NG lavage, [**Name (NI) 647**] Heme and recommended PPI 80mg IV bolus and gtt and close Hct monitoring. Heme felt patient should clear dabigatran by 5am given half life, recommended Vitamin K 10mg PO also, given INR 1.9. On transfer to the MICU, VS afebrile, HR88, BP129/87, RR18, O2 sat 95% on RA. . On arrival to the MICU, patient resting comfortably in bed. Endorses fatigue from long afternoon/evening but otherwise denies symptoms. . Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache, cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations currently. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency. 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is an 83 year-old woman with history of recent hospitalization with upper GI bleed found to have gastric AVMs, atrial fibrillation, thyroid cancer s/p thyroidectomy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, and CAD s/p MI presenting with bright red blood per rectum starting this morning.  She awoke from sleep at 1:30 AM to have bowel movement and had bright red blood mixed with dark stool.  Patient had four episodes of BRBPR at home and came to ED.  Pt also noted intermittent epigastric cramping. No nausea, vomiting, hematemesis. . Patient was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**], yesterday [**2796-5-26**] following hospitalization for BRBPR and melena secondary to upper GI bleed while on dabigatran for atrial fibrillation.  Patient was admitted to MICU and received a total of 3 units PRBC for a transfusion goal of 30. She received vitamin K 10 mg PO for elevated INR and was started on PPI.  An EGD showed  multiple AVMs and gastritis and the  AVMs were ablated. The ppi gtt was continued and plans were made for colonoscopy. She underwent colonoscopy which demonstrated no acute source for her bleeding. At discharge, anticoagulation was held. . Patient's hospitalization course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with tachycardia in 110s.  She received metoprolol IV and diltiazem IV and her home oral medications were restarted.  Patient was rate controlled prior to discharge. Patient's anticoagulation was held during admission and at discharge given GI bleed. . In the ED, initial vs were: P 100, BP 100/60 R 16 O2 98% on RA. Patient underwent NG lavage, which initally returned 10 - 15 cc of bright red blood (no coffee grounds) and then ran clear.  Pt was noted to have 50 - 100 cc of bright red blood from rectum, no melena.  Exam was notable for epigastric tenderness.  Patient received 1 L NS and Type & Cross.  She underwent non-contrast CT of abdomen to assess for perforation given recent colonsocopy. Labs were notable for a HCT of 37 (increased from 30 on discharge yesterday).  On transfer HR 77, BP 97/62. . On the floor, patient is complaining of intermittent crampy abdominal pain, but has not has any further episodes of BRBPR since the ED. 
The patient is a 65 year old male who had a cardiac catheterization eight years prior at [**Hospital3 2324**], which reported three vessel disease.  The patient was recommended to have bypass surgery at that time but the patient had a second opinion at the [**Hospital1 341**] and has since been treated medically.  The patient has been doing well since then.  The patient swims three times a week and does not have any symptoms.  The patient does report that he has developed exertional dyspnea and fatigue with activity like mowing his lawn or after climbing two to three flights of stairs.  All these symptoms resolve with rest, and the patient denies having any symptoms at rest and denies any chest discomfort. The patient was scheduled for back surgery at [**Hospital6 11748**] and a stress echocardiogram was done as part of the workup.  He exercised for roughly three minutes and had diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities that were nondiagnostic due to left bundle branch block.  The patient's echocardiogram revealed dilated left ventricle with markedly decreased contractility globally, and his ejection fraction was 35 to 40 percent.  There was concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and dilated left atrium.  There was normal right ventricular size and contractility and mildly dilated aortic root.  With exercise, there was no augmentation of contractility, and ejection fraction remained to be 35 to 40 percent.  The patient denied claudication, orthopnea, lightheadedness.  The patient had a cardiac catheterization which showed the patient had an ejection fraction of 20 to 25 percent without any mitral regurgitation with three vessel disease. 
Code stroke information: 87 y.o. lady with PMH of HTN presented to ER after passing out and having left side weakness after that. She was brought to ER within 45 minutes of presentation. She had no signs of recovery. Code stroke was called. . 80 RHF with HTN and no other known PMH was brought to the ED for evaluation of left sided weakness. Promptly code stroke was called. She was last well seen around 1140 am. Her husband noted around noon, that she was not moving the left side. he noted that she was slurred and not her usual self. He called 911 and she was brought to the ED. In the ED, when she arrived, she was hemiparatic on the left side and the arm was much weaker than the leg. She was slurring her speech. . ICU admission: 80F w/ hx of HTN presented to ED after syncopal episode followed by L-sided weakness and dysarthria. CT head showed no evidence of hemorrhage or acute infarct. Pt was within 3-hour window for tPA, and it was thus administered. After receiving approximately half the tPA dose, she began to have gum bleeding. The tPA was stopped for 10 minutes and then restarted to complete the entire dose. Shortly thereafter the patient's L-sided weakness showed some improvement; dysarthria continued. En route to the SICU, the patient became bradycardic to the 30s, lethargic, and showed worsening L-sided weakness and neglect compared to that demonstrated in the ED. She was given a 1000cc bolus of LR with improvement in heart rate to the 40s/low 50s and mild improvement in her mental status. She underwent a STAT non-contrast head CT, which showed no evidence of hemorrhage. 
83 yo woman with possible h/o monocular left eye melanoma and HTN presents with slurred speech. Her nephew spoke with her this morning and found her speech to be clear. She apparently has been complaining of dizziness on/off for the past two weeks or so but had refused to see her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] friend called her at about 5PM and heard that her speech was slurred and called 911. She was brought to [**Hospital6 **] where she was noted to have coherent but slurred speech and right sided weakness of the face and arm. She denied headache. A NC CT of the head was performed which revealed a left-sided capsular hemorrhage. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation and further management. 
44M with known htn but does not go to a physician x 4y presented wit ha six hour history of chest pain radiating down through his back that was crushing in nature, persisting, without mollifying factors.  Initially went to [**Hospital3 4047**] where CTA demonstrated [**Location (un) 11768**] type B dissection through the external and internal iliacs but perfusion maintained to all organ systems. Arrives here without vasoactive medication, started on labetalol with good result initially, now becoming refractory with continued pain.  HR stable, EKG with twi but otherwise nl, equal bp's bilaterally, no chest pain but back pain, CXR demonstrates no mediastinal widening and no hemothorax. 
85 yo man with H/O angina, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CKD (baseline Cr 1.7-2.1), CAD s/p NSTEMI (s/p rotational atherectomy RCA [**3100**], [**Year (4 digits) **] PCI [**3101**], [**Name (NI) 11771**] PTCA and proximal RCA PCI [**3106**]) moderate-severe mitral regurgitation, who presented with one week of intermittent chest pain. Per patient report, the first episode occurred on Saturday, described as Left shoulder pain into his back, [**6-14**], nonexertional, but associated with mild diaphoresis; no shortness of breath, palpitations, or nausea. Pain lasted less than 20 minutes and resolved with SLNTG x1. Since then, he reportedly had mildly elevated BPs at home, intermittent similar episodes of chest pain (about 1 episode per day) each responding well to SLNTG. On Thursday, patient reports he was using his lawn mower when had increased pain, more than previously, feeling more similar to prior anginal pain, resolving after 2 SLNTG. He called his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2171**], who felt the patient should be directly admitted for cardiac catheterization after receiving pre-procedure hydration overnight on the [**Hospital1 1498**] service. On the day of transfer to the CCU, patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed 3-vessel disease, severe left ventricular diastolic failure with moderately elevated wedge with prominent V waves consistent with significant mitral regurgitation. Patient was found to have significant RCA disease. A bare metal stent was placed in the proximal RCA complicated by wire induced dissection in the RCA managed with two additional BMS. This was further complicated by plaque shift and embolization into a major RV branch with transient inferior ST elevation, nausea, heaves, bradycardia, and chest pain. He was given atropine, which resolved the bradycardia. Patient reports he continued to have retrosternal chest pain after the procedure that lasted 20 minutes. Currently on the floor, patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis, orthopnea, PND. 
Patient is a 50-year-old African-American man with a history of hypertension, insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus, status post upper GI bleed, status post esophagogastroduodenoscopy with Epinephrine injection.

In summary, this is a 38F PMH DM1, CKD (baseline creatinine 1.7), HTN presenting with nausea/vomiting x 1 week and diarrhea x 1 day. During this time she was unable to tolerate po's for last week. There were no associated fevers, chills, abdominal pain, melena, BRBPR, recent travel, uncooked foods, sick contacts, or recent antibiotic use. At outpatient renal clinic, her creatinine was found to be up to 3.7 on routine laboratories [**3019-11-1**] and patient advised to present to ED. . In the ED, laboratories were notable for FSG 464, hyponatremia, anion gap 14, creatinine 3.7, dirty urinalysis with trace ketones. VBG 7.26/36/60 with lactate 1.2, no serum/urine ketones were obtained. Patient given unasyn for urinary tract infection and 1L NS. She was started on insulin gtt and admitted to the MICU. A right IJ was placed for access. . In the MICU, she received an insulin gtt overnight with improvement in her fingersticks to 100-140s. Her serum ketones were negative and her gap was followed and remained stable at 10. She received further IVF with improvement in her creatinine and was switch to home NPH w/ insulin sliding scale once she tolerated po intake. She had no further episodes of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea once she was in the MICU. There was concern for diabetic foot ulcers and she was switched to cipro/vanc. Podiatry was consulted and thought her foot ulcerations were [**12-26**] gout. Foot xrays were obtained, tissue swab was sent for culture/path for gout. Preliminary swab showing GPCs and GPRs at time of transfer. . On arrival to the floor, patient was noting significant improvement in her nausea/vomiting/malaise and was tolerating po with blood glucose <200. . Please see MICU course for further details. 
Mr [**Known patient lastname **] is a 77 y/o African-American male with PMHx of hypertension, gout on colchicine, osteoarthritis, and heavy alcohol consumption who has recently been seen for nausea and diarrhea, and found to have new acute renal failure on his labs. . Per the patient's history, he has had diarrhea off-and on since starting colchicine, but this has been progressively worse over the last 3-4 weeks with frequent bowel movements following meals and also nocturnal bowel movements. He has had no bloody bowel movements, nor melena though he reports them as darkened. He also has had some nausea/vomiting following certain foods that has been increasing in severity/frequency, but it not a consistent feature. No hematemesis. This has also been over the last month. He reports a 30 pound weight loss over the last 4 months with decreased appetite. He has also been having chronic knee pain off and on for at least the last 5 years, either gouty or chronic osteoarthritis (has had a knee replacement in the past). . ROS is otherwise notable for mild dyspnea on exertion that is not acutely new, and right leg>left leg that is old as well. He reports pain on digital rectal exam and pain on bowel movement, some prostatic symptoms of nocturia and frequency, but no dysuria. He has had no fevers, headache, visual changes, or abdominal pain. . In the ED, initial VS:  09:40   97.8 103 61/41 16 99, BP verified and remained low though he was mentating well. He was given 5L of crystalloid with improvement in HR to 60s, though with BPs that were still marginal. Foley catheter was inserted initially with little return, later putting out 300cc of clear urine. CXR was performed without e/o pneumonia. He was guaiac negative in the ED, though recently had been guaiac positive in his PCP's office.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10922**] is an 87 year old woman with history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and previous DVT on warfarin who was BIBA after found down. Her family had been unable to reach her for nearly 24 hours when they went to her house and found her unresponsive in the bathroom, barely breathing. She was intubated in the field for "[**Last Name (un) 5979**]-[**Doctor Last Name **]" respirations, and her initial blood pressures were 60/palp. She was given two liters of fluid with improvement in her blood pressures. . On arrival to the ED, her blood pressure was 73/23. She was given two liters of normal saline, and her blood pressures improved to 96/30. Inital vitals: T36.5C, HR 96, BP 96/30, RR 16. A right-sided groin cordis was placed. She received one dose of levofloxacin and clindamycin for community-acquired and aspiration pneumonia coverage. CT head demonstrated an evolving R MCA stroke, and neurology recommended MICU admission (with stroke consult service following). Neurosurgery was consulted in case cerebral edema would require neurosurgical decompression. She received a total of 6L normal saline. Blood cultures were drawn and urine was sent. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 60 year-old man with a history of CKD (baseline creatinine 1.5-2.0 due to atrophic right kidney [**1-9**] bilateral RAS), 4.2 cm infrarenal AAA, peripheral artery disease, dyslipidemia, HTN, and spinal stenosis who is urgently transferred from the ortho spine service to the MICU on the morning of [**2882-11-19**] for worsening hypotension and hypoxemia.  He was admitted for an elective anterior and posterior L4-S1 fusion which took place on [**2882-11-16**] and [**2882-11-17**].  He tolerated the surgeries well and had a recorded net blood loss of 950cc from the two procedures. Post-operatively, his hematocrit dropped from 34 to 25, and he received 2 units of PRBCs witha bump up to 31, which has since drifted back down to 27.  He has had intermittent hypotension with SBPs dipping into the 70s.  He has developed worsening renal failure with a creatinine now up to 2.4 in the setting of worsening oliguria. His I/O's were 5800/710cc on [**2882-11-17**].  He has also had a gradually worsening hypoxia with a 5L n.c. O2 requirement throughout [**2882-11-18**] (no baseline oxygen requirement). . A medicine consult was obtained on [**2882-11-18**] due to these ongoing issues.  Their assessment was that he was significant volume depleted, and that his hypoxia and low grade temperatures were due to atelectasis.  They recommended holding his antihypertensives (most of which had already been held) and fluid resuscitating him aggressively.  A FENa was calculated to be 0.7%.  Overnight, the patient was triggered for worsening oliguria (30cc over 3 hours), hypotension (80/50 in right arm, 60/40 in left arm), and hypoxia with O2Sat 93% on 5L nc with 70% shovel mask.  The overnight medicine consult resident was called.  An ABG was 7.38/34/53 and an ECG showed new ST segment depressions in V2-V6 raising concern for either ACS or PE.  With these findings, he was transferred to the MICU for further care. Per the ortho resident, the risks of post-operative bleeding (including epidural hematoma) with anticoagulation would be quite high. 
HPI: Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 61 yo M with h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia, PVD, and CKD who presented to [**Location (un) **] at 3 am with chest pain. 1 day PTA, patient experienced a chest tightness and pressure while working at his computer.

This is a 33 year-old male with a history of ITP, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, DM type I, and splenomegaly scheduled for splenectomy in [**Month (only) 1082**] who presents with 3 days of progressive weakness, lightheadedness with exertion and 1 day of jaundice. He was in his USOH until approximately [**2504-11-18**] when he contracted cold-like symptoms with rhinorhea, cough, and malaise. He then ([**2504-12-1**]) presented to his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **], with left lower quadrant pain, which he started noticing when he awoke on [**11-28**] and a CT Abd/Pelv showed stable, marked splenomegaly.  He was given pain meds and scheduled for splenectomy.  Also, of note he was given Pnemoccoal, Meningiococcal, and HIB vaccinations on [**2504-12-2**]. . On Sat [**2504-12-6**] he began noticing fatigue and lightheadedness with exertion which progressively worsened to the point of nearly passing out each time he got up.  His blood sugars were difficult to control, requiring nearly double the dose of insulin.  Urine was brown. He also endorses N/V and is able to hear his heart in his ears. . In the ED,  vitals were 98.9, hr 144, bp 116/73, rr 30, SaO2 98% RA.  He got 2L IVF with 12 U insulin.  Insulin gtt was started as patient noted to have AG of 15 and sugars in 400s.  Admitted to ICU for DKA and hemolytic anemia .

The history between [**3-9**] and [**3-24**], please see the prior Discharge Summary.  This Discharge Summary covers from [**3-25**] through [**4-7**]. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia and underwent induction with Ara-C and idarubicin 7+3.  His main issues were, in summary: 1.  HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY:  The patient demonstrated an ablated marrow which was expected and anticipated after undergoing the chemotherapy.  Follow-up marrow results done to show if there was appropriate recovery of the bone marrow were still pending, though clinical picture suggested that the normal cells have returned; though, the question as to whether there are additional leukemoid cells has not yet been determined. The patient was to follow up in about one week's time to begin his consolidation chemotherapy which was to be done as an outpatient by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. The patient received multiple platelet and blood transfusions as supportive treatment for his ablative process as associated with his chemotherapy. 2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient's primary issue was that he developed a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis infection in his blood which showed positive growth from [**3-24**] through [**3-28**]; thus, five days. From [**3-29**] through [**4-1**], all cultures were subsequently negative.  The patient was treated first with linezolid and then switched to Synercid because the enterococcus was found to be sensitive to that antibiotic, and the concern about linezolid was that it had myelosuppressive effects.  The patient will undergo 14 days of therapy of Synercid, dating from the point at which he was found to have negative blood cultures on [**Month (only) 115**], so that he will have his last day of Synercid (as mentioned before of 600 mg intravenously q.8h.) on [**4-12**]. The patient was also treated with acyclovir 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. for his herpes.  He was covered empirically with other antibiotics as per protocol related to being neutropenic and then having an neutropenic fever until cultures were identified. It should be noted that stool culture also showed vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis; however, his catheter tip remained negative.  Fungal cultures were negative.  The patient was Clostridium difficile negative, and he did not have any vegetations founds on his heart valves by both transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms; making us confident that he did not have endocarditis. The patient was followed by the Infectious Disease Service. The fellow was Syngevony Wadwa, and the attending was [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1421**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 800**]. The patient also had what looked to be a tooth in his right maxillary sinus leading to almost complete obstruction of the (OMU) ostiomeatal unit.  The Ear/Nose/Throat Service performed a removal of that tooth particle and drainage of the sinus, and that was done on [**Last Name (LF) 2928**], [**4-3**], with no complications and minimal blood loss. 2.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient has baseline Addison disease, though he was consistently hypokalemic.  He was maintained with prednisone and hydrocortisone throughout his admission. For a time, he had received hydrocortisone 25 mg intravenously q.8h.   He was then converted to prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 5 mg p.o. q.p.m.   Then, before the surgery, 100 mg intravenously q.8h., down to 50 mg intravenously q.8h., and eventually back down to prednisone 5 mg q.a.m. and 2.5 mg q.p.m. The patient was keep off of his Florinef until the day before discharge when he was started on 0.025 mg p.o. q.d. and then discharged on his regular dose of 0.1 mg p.o. q.d.   He was also supplemented with potassium chloride for his consistent low potassium of 30 mEq of p.o. b.i.d. Because he was unwilling or unable to take the potassium by mouth during the hospital stay, he was given potassium chloride as replacement fluids.   However, again, on discharge, he left with the prescription of potassium chloride 30 mEq p.o. b.i.d. For nausea and vomiting, the patient was given Reglan and carafate which he said did not help him particularly.  He also was given Ativan 1 mg to 2 mg p.o. q.8h. which he was discharged on also with his discharge medications.  He was given a 3-day prescription of that as assistance if he were to feel nauseated.

This is a 60-year-old right-handed gentlemen with coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease who was having difficulty speaking after a left carotid endarterectomy.  The patient has had high grade bilateral carotid stenosis for at least [**4-29**], while he was sitting in a chair, he developed sudden onset of right arm and leg numbness, followed by right arm and leg weakness.  He had also had difficulty speaking.  He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] and underwent a left carotid endarterectomy on [**5-4**] and afterwards began having a severe left-sided headache behind his left eye that could last for hours and was constant.  Never the less, he visits to [**Hospital1 2402**] for continued headache and nausea and vomiting.  During one of his visits, he had contortion of his right face and bilateral arm jerking and was started on Dilantin.  He recovered from that event and was again discharged home. On [**5-19**], he presented yet again for persistent headaches, confusion and inability to talk.  He new what he wanted to say, but could not get the words out.  He was repeating phrases and using incorrect words.  The wife reported an incident before they went to [**Hospital1 2402**] in which he asked her to bring him his Dilantin, but when she brought it, he said "that is not the pills, then went to a dresser draw and pulled out a handkerchief and said this is what he was referring to."  At [**Hospital1 2402**], he was not following commands. Head CT showed a linear hyperintense region in the left central temporal lobe but also other lesions in the left posterior parietal hyperintensity spanning 10 images and slight surrounding hypointensity and a left frontal cortical hypointensity with a small surrounding region of hyperintensity.  There was slight increase focal effacement on the left with hypointensity in the left corona radiata as well.  His blood pressure was 188/69 and was treated with labetalol 40 intravenously.  He was then transferred to the [**Hospital6 253**]. 
This is a 60-year-old man with CAD, PVD who had difficulty speaking after left carotid endarterectomy in [**2969-4-24**].  The patient has had bilateral carotid stenosis.  On [**4-29**] while he was sitting in a chair he developed sudden onset of right arm and leg numbness, followed by right arm and leg weakness.  He also had difficulty speaking.  He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] and underwent a left carotid endarterectomy on [**5-4**] and afterwards began having severe left sided headache behind his left eye that lasted for hours and was constant. Nevertheless, he visited [**Hospital3 **] for continued headaches and nausea and vomiting.  During one of those visits he had a contortion of his right face and bilateral arm jerking and was started on Dilantin with presumptive diagnosis of seizures.  He has recovered from that event when was again discharged home.  On [**5-19**] he again presented with persistent headaches, confusion and inability to talk.  He had difficulty getting his words out.  He had a head CT at [**Hospital3 **] which showed a linear hyperintense region in the left central temporal lobe but also other lesions in the left posterior parietal lobes.  At that time he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**].  MRI of his head showed left MCA/ACA and left MCA/PCA watershed strokes with acute and subacute hemorrhage conversions.  It was thought at that time that he had extended his watershed infarcts after carotid endarterectomy leading to a carotid hyperperfusion syndrome.  The patient was discharged from the neurologic Intensive Care Unit to a rehab facility.  On Thursday, [**2969-6-1**], patient's wife noticed erythema on patient's face.  On [**6-2**] the visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) 8599**] [**Last Name (Titles) 11140**] of a rash on his arms as well.  The patient was noted to be febrile and was admitted to the [**Company 189**] Firm.  In the EW, patient's Dilantin was discontinued and he was given Tegretol instead. 
This is a 65-year-old male patient with a history of hypercholesterolemia, benign prostatic hypertrophy and hypertension who had a positive exercise tolerance test, was admitted for outpatient cardiac catheterization on [**3360-11-14**] which revealed a 50% left main occlusion with three vessel coronary artery disease with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45 to 50%  The patient was discharged home and was admitted on the morning of [**3360-11-20**] for elective coronary artery bypass graft. PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS: 1.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q day. 2.  Zestril 10 mg p.o. q day. 3.  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q day. 4.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q day. The patient was taken to the operating room on [**3360-11-20**] with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1519**] where the patient underwent coronary artery bypass graft times five with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the RPL, sequential to the RPDA, saphenous vein to the OM and saphenous vein to the diag. Postoperatively the patient was transported from the operating room to Cardiac Surgery Recovery Room on intravenous Neo-Synephrine drip in stable condition. On postop day one the patient had been weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation, remained on intravenous Neo-Synephrine drip, was atrially paced via epicardial wires and his chest tubes were removed.  Later in the day on postop day one the patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the Telemetry floor in stable condition.  The patient was begun with physical therapy, started ambulation and progressing with cardiac rehabilitation. The patient remained stable on postop day two and on postop day three the patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 90 to 120.  He was treated with intravenous Lopressor as well as intravenous Diltiazem and eventually given intravenous Amiodarone.  This controlled his ventricular response but he remained in atrial fibrillation. Over the next couple of days the patient remains with a stable blood pressure but was in and out of atrial fibrillation.  His beta-blockers were increased and his Amiodarone was continued.  He was begun on intravenous Heparin and transitioned to Coumadin for anti-coagulation for his persistent postoperative atrial fibrillation.  The patient has had no other postoperative concerns and has otherwise progressed well.  He has remained in the hospital this length of time due to difficulty controlling his ventricular rate and slow increasing of his Coumadin to get his INR to therapeutic. The patient had his intravenous Heparin drip discontinued on postoperative day eight, his INR was therapeutic at that time, had bumped 2.8, he remained in atrial fibrillation however, at that time with rates up to the 130's.  His Lopressor was increased up to 50 mg b.i.d. and he was maintained on Amiodarone. On postop day ten the patient remained in sinus rhythm with a ventricular rate in the 60's on Lopressor and Amiodarone and remained on Coumadin with an INR of 2.8.  On postop day 11, [**3360-12-1**] the patient's INR was 2.2, remained on Coumadin, remained on Metoprolol as well as Amiodarone however, his Metoprolol had been held a couple of times over the past 24 hours due to hypotension. After discussion with the patient's primary cardiologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 121**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] it was determined best to discontinue the Metoprolol due to the patient's intermittent hypotension and discharge him home on Amiodarone for his atrial fibrillation. He has remained in normal sinus rhythm now for approximately 48 hours and is stable to be discharged home. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Most recent vital signs today [**3360-12-1**] are temperature 97, pulse 52 and normal sinus rhythm. Respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 108/50, room air oxygen saturation 97%  Neurologically the patient is alert and oriented with no apparent neurologic deficits.  His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His coronary exam is regular rate and rhythm.  His abdomen is benign.  His incisions are clean, dry and intact. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q day. 2.  Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. q day. 3.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q day.

She vomited times one.  She ate breakfast as usual.  At about 9:30, she was found with her eyes closed and unresponsive by a caretaker.  She was breathing, but not arousable, and EMTs were called to bring her into the emergency department.  While en route to the hospital, the patient vomited an additional time. The caretakers indicated that this episode was unlike past seizures.  Her last [**Doctor Last Name 11188**] mal seizure was in [**Month (only) 202**].  The only recent medicine change was a reduction in her Lamictal dose from 175 mg a day to 150 mg a day.  This change was to decrease her degree of lethargy. In the emergency department, the patient was responsive only to pain and had decreased communication and reduced arousal. Her temperature in the emergency department was 100.2??????F.  A neurology consultation was obtained and they suggested a head CT scan and a toxic metabolic screen.  She was empirically treated with 2 gm of ceftriaxone for meningitis and was hydrated with fluids. 
This is a 37 year old woman with cerebral palsy, status post right femur fracture; status post surgery in [**3339-10-19**], which was complicated by aspiration pneumonia where she went to rehabilitation.

She was given 2 mg of Ativan and afterwards, she became acutely short of breath and was concern for respiration pneumonia.  Room air saturations of 80% with pulse of 120. The patient had the last seizure two to three months ago. She had recently been taking off of her Dilantin because of concern for Dilantin toxicity with nystagmus and was just continued on her Keppra and Lamictal. This patient has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube for dysphagia and is always n.p.o.  She was on Lovenox 30 mg twice a day times six weeks after her right femur fracture and open reduction and internal fixation, which she completed on [**3339-12-17**].  She was non verbal at the time of admission but, per mother, she gets that way after seizures and mother is unable to answer questions about review of systems.  Recent treatment with postoperative presumed aspiration pneumonia with Levofloxacin and Flagyl for ten days.  Chest x-ray showed resolution of that infiltrate on the right lower lobe.  In the Emergency Room, she was given Albuterol neb, Levofloxacin times one, Flagyl times one.  She and no intravenous access. Right internal jugular vein central line was placed. She received some Tylenol 500 cc normal saline bolus and was taken to CT.

Pt is a 67 yo man with hx of paroxysmal Afib, HTN, and hyperlipidemia who is a pt of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11222**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11223**] who presented today for pulmonary vein isolation, procedure complicated by presumed [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 11224**] and cardiac tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis. Per the medical record, he is an otherwise healthy man who had been undergoing therapy for his paroxysmal Afib with propafenone and diltiazem (and maintained on Coumadin), however continued to have symptomatic episodes of Afib with feelings of palpitations and anxiety and decision was made to have pulmonary vein isolation and ablation. He also had sx of upper respiratory congestion in the week prior to presentation. Please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 11225**] note for details re: procedure. Briefly, femoral access was obtained without difficulty. A PFO was identified and wire advanced from RA to LA. It was felt that there was perforation of the posterior left atrium. During the ablation the patient's BP began to decline and he was found to have a large pericardial effusion on ECHO. His SBP reached a nadir of approx 65mmHG (<5min) and he was placed on pressors including phenylephrine, ephedrine, and epinephrine. Once pericardiocentesis was initiated, SBP rose again steadily allowing discontinuation of ephedrine and epinephrine. His heparin was reversed with 50mg of protamine during the procedure. He also received a total of 3500cc of IVFs (LR). A total of approx 950 cc of blood was expressed over 30min and a pericardial drain was placed. A repeat ECHO showed essential complete resolution of pericardial effusion. Upon transfer to the ICU the patient was maintained on phenylephrine which was discontinued on arrival with SBPs in 90s. The patient arrived intubated and sedated with propofol.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname 11357**] [**Known patient lastname **] [**Doctor Last Name 11358**] is a 78y/o lady with asthma, DM2, multiple abdominal surgeries for SBOs after perforated jejunal diverticulim in [**3200**], and falls with recent Colles' fracture who presented to the ED due to cough and dyspnea and is admitted to the MICU due to elevated lactate. . Of note, she was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 11359**] for hypotension after reported fall (unclear etiology, hypotension resolved), as well as altered mental status (presumably related to medications received for her wrist fracture, resolved with Narcan).  Of note, on that presentation she received steroids in the ED because she was wheezy but they were not continued.  She was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] but was transferred to the floor and was discharged home.  No elevated lactate during the previous admission.  No changes were made to her medications. . She reports that since discharge, she has felt quite weak.  She has had gradually worsening shortness of breath and wheezing associted with a cough productive of white sputum.  No fever but has had chills and sweats.  Non-exertional chest tightness associated with the wheezing.  Reports worsened symptoms upon waking up in the AM.

Labs were notable for WBC 15.4 (85.6% PMNs, no bands), Na 130, bicarb 16, and lactate 5.3.  CXR showed no acute process.  She complained of some mild abdominal discomfort so given her h/o SBO's she underwent CT abdomen that also showed no acute process.  She received Vanc/Zosyn, Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs, Insulin 6U for glucose in the 300's, and Tylenol 1g PO.  After 6L normal saline, repeat lactate was 4.5 so she was admitted to the MICU. . On arrival to the MICU, she still feels very short of breath but can speak in full sentences.  Is worried that the Prednisone has made her [**Doctor Last Name 11360**] without helping much, and that it has made her blood sugar out of control.  Denies any fevers.  No rhinorrhea or sinus congestion.  No sick contacts at home.  No recent antibiotics.  She has continued left wrist pain from her fracture.  No more abdomnal pain - she says that the pain she had in the ED was mild dull peri-umbilical pain that she thinks was related to being hungry, as well as swallowing phlegm - and did not feel like the pain she had during SBO's.  No constipation/obstipation.  When asked if she thinks she has had poor PO intake recently, she denies.  Drinks a lot of water. . REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: (+) Per HPI.

Patient reports last walking on Saturday morning going about her usual am routine and then sat down in a chair. She was unable to get up after that and required use of a wheelchair since then. VNA saw her today and noted that she was unable to bear weight and recommended emergent evaluation. She was initially taken to an OSH where she was evaluated by a neurologist there who recommended transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. At baseline, walks with a walker especially at home and uses a wheelchair when she goes outside." Images from OSH L-spine MRI and CT-chest obtained.  In total CTL-Spine MRI all unrevealing. Exam fluctuates. Was dramatically improved on the morning of [**2645-9-23**] with 4-5/5 strength in the lower extremities. When rounding with the attending in the afternoon of the same day she was able to move the legs, but was weaker with left worse than right. It is not clear at this time what might cause such a rapidly fluctuating physical exam. EMG Fellow - [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7582**] - has been curbsided regarding the possibility of this being [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Location (un) **] Myasthenic syndrome. She is discussing the utility of EMG/NCS with her colleagues. An MRI of the pelvis was ordered to look for ancillary mass compressing the lumbosacral plexus. CT-chest at OSH and X-ray show large cavitary lesion in the right chest. Per the patient's PCP the CT was read as worrysome for bronchogenic carcinoma. A BAL was negative for AFB and was culture negative. It was also negative for malignant cytology. T/SICU team is helping by consulting thoracic surgery.

This 88-year-old female with coronary artery disease and left bundle branch block presented with acute onset of dyspnea for 18 hours prior. She was in her usual state of health, fairly sedentary and able to ambulate about one block before developing chest tightness and claudication, until the night before admission when she developed progressive dyspnea at rest and was unable to sleep.  She had a cough, plus-minus fevers, and had to sit upright to breath.  She has a baseline four-pillow orthopnea. She also reported chest tightness on the day of admission similar to anginal pain in the past.  The chest pain peaked at noon on the day of admission.  She called the emergency medical technicians and presented to the Emergency Department.  There she was tachypneic with 30-40 respiratory rate, oxygen saturation 100% on 4 liters face mask, and tachycardiac to 120.  Electrocardiogram showed left bundle branch block.  She was treated with aspirin, Lasix, Heparin, and intravenous Nitroglycerin with mild improvement in her symptoms.  At 10:30 p.m. on the day of admission, she developed acute decompensation with a respiratory rate of 40-50 and poor air movement.  Her saturations remained at 100%.  She was placed on BIPAP 10/5 with eventual respiratory rate decrease to 30 after 10 minutes.  She was then given Albuterol nebulizers and oxygen via face mask with continued improvement and was then admitted to the CCU for further management. 
The patient is an 88 year old female with a history of COPD and coronary artery disease who had a recent long hospitalization for shortness of breath presumed to be secondary to COPD and had chest pain of unclear etiology.  She now presents early this morning after calling EMS in respiratory distress.  EMS noted that she was wheezing, using respiratory accessory muscles and slightly diaphoretic, although oriented.  She was given albuterol and Atrovent nebs with some decrease in her level of distress. Her O2 sats were noted to be 98% at that time.  In the emergency room she was again noted to be wheezing and had worsening PO2 that did not improve with nonrebreather or BiPAP.  The patient had ABG performed which revealed pH of 7.22, PCO2 89, PO2 18 in room air.  The patient was subsequently intubated and admitted to the MICU.

64 y/o with OA of right hip,presents for surgical management of pain. His hematology team was consulted for pre and post operative care. infusion, high risk bleeding, high risk thrombosis . History of Present Illness: 64 y/o male with chronic hepatitis B infection with grade [**2-24**] cirrhosis (presently suppressed), antithrombin III deficiency and superior mesenteric thrombosis [**2635**](managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2760**], on coumadin), thrombocytopenia/macrocytosis, esophageal varices, and hypertension who is POD #0 s/p left total hip replacement with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. . From surgical perspective, blood loss estimated to be 750 cc and procedure was uncomplicated. Patient received 3L LR, 50 mL 25% albumin, 2 mg versed, 8 mg decadron, 250 mcg fentanyl, total of 6 mg dilaudid, 4 g cefazolin. UOP was 240 cc during procedure. . From hematology perspective, patient presented with several days of abdominal pain and bloating in [**2636-3-24**]. He underwent a CT can at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2636-4-14**], which demonstrated a nonocculusive endoluminal thrombus within the superior mesenteric vein with extension into more distal branches and extending into the main portal vein. Work up at the time revealed low Protein C and antithrombin III levels (Antithrombin III 48%, normal range 80 to 120%; Protein C antigen 31%, protein C functional 46%). On [**2636-6-29**], the antithrombin III levels were determined was 54% and the antithrombin antigen was 65%, both below the range of normal. Further testing revealed he was negative for prothrombin gene mutation, factor V Leiden, and anticardiolipin. He was placed on coumadin therapy indefinitely with goal INR of [**1-26**]. . In anticipation of his upcoming surgery, he was recently seen in [**Hospital **] clinic on [**2642-8-12**]. At that time he was informed that hip replacement surgery is associated with a very high risk of developing thrombotic complications. For this reason, he was recommended to stop coumadin 5 days prior to surgery and start a Lovenox bridge (150 mg daily) until the day before his surgery. He had low antithrombin III levels on [**2642-8-12**] (66%), although these levels were all checked while he was still on Coumadin. For this reason, he was recommended to receive ATIII repletion therapy to correct the deficiency prior to having the procedure. IVC filter was also considered for DVT prophylaxis, but he had a relatively contraindication to its use with a prior history of SMV thrombosis, and it was felt that collateral thrombosis could further put that vascular tree at risk. . With regard to his AT3 deficiency, patient received 1 dose before surgery to keep level > 100%. Level at baseline is approximately 55%. . Prior to transfer, HR 84 and BP 144/89. Access 2 piv - 16 guage x 2. Unable to obtain A-line as catheter would not thread.

Initially, pt complained of exterional chest pain and dyspnea but when asked later, he reported only a few seconds of chest pain 1.5 weeks ago that resolved with one SL NTG. Pt states that he presented to the ED today at his son's urging and because he was starting to feel weak. Pt denies abd pain, dysuria, fevers, chills, cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat. He states that he has never had problems with high sugar, no hx of alcohol abuse but one sister does have diabetes. In the ED, he received 2L of NS and 1L of NS with 40mEq of KCl. He also received 10U of insulin x 1 and was started on an insulin drip. Given his initial presentation with chest pain, cardiac enzymes were drawn and troponin was slightly elevated at 0.03. Pt was admitted to the MICU for insulin drip. 
A 60 year old gentleman with HIV (on HAART, CD4 323, VL 500s as of [**9-15**]) transferred from the [**Hospital1 3228**] ED with 4 days of cough, subjective fever and dyspnea found to be hypoxic and placed on a non-rebreather at the time of transfer. . In the ED, initial vs were: 97.5 83 109/60 16 95 NRB. Patient was given NS 1L, albuterol, Ceftriaxone and Azithro with Vanc ordered but not given.  He remained normotensive. . On the floor, the patient is awake but clearly working to breath and difficult to understand because of high flow oxygen.  He confirms the story above and reports that he is feeling better overall after interventions thus far.  He endorses dyspnea with cough but no chest pain, abdominal pain or changes in bowel habits.  He has not taken any medicines in the past 4 days including methadone and HAART.  He is currently without pain. . Of note, the patient reports variable abdominal distention and increased neck girth for the past few months.  He reports of a recent sleep study and a potential "belly test," but is unsure of the specifics.  Review of his recent records reveals an abdominal and chest CT which are reported below. There is no record of sleep study that I could obtain at this time. 
This 64 year old white male developed new onset exertional symptoms one and one half months prior to admission.  He first noticed that he was developing chest discomfort and severe shortness of breath while cutting his lawn.  It would always resolve in five minutes with rest and he contact[**Name (NI) **] his physician and had [**Name Initial (PRE) **] positive stress echocardiogram.  He exercised five minutes on the [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, stopping secondary to fatigue, but he had 2.[**Street Address(2) 11579**] depressions inferiorly in V4 through V6 along with chest pain in early recovery.  An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of greater than 55% with 1+ mitral regurgitation.  With exercise, there was new anterior, septal and apical severe hypokinesis.  He was referred for cardiac catheterization and underwent cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 69**] on [**3322-4-24**], which revealed his left ventricular ejection fraction 60%.  He had hypokinesis in the inferior and posterior basal walls.  He had 2+ mitral regurgitation.  His proximal right coronary artery had 100% stenosis, proximal left anterior descending had a 90% stenosis, diagonal one had a 70% stenosis, proximal circumflex had a 60% stenosis, and he was now admitted for coronary artery bypass graft. 
68M PMH sig for multiple myeloma who presents with respiratory failure from XRT today.  She was noted to be wheezy with O2 sats in the 90's.  His respiratory status continued to decline, and EMS was called; he was intubated en route to [**Hospital1 18**].  Here, a CXR demonstrated a large left pleural effusion, nearly effacing the entire lung.  The patient became briefly hypotensive, down to 75/50; aggressive IVF only increased his bp to the low 80's, so he was placed on a norepinephrine gtt that was eventually stopped as his bp improved over the next few hours.  He had a CT that also demonstrated a large effusion with contralateral mediastinal shift; it was read as concerning for fungal infection.  He received vancomycin and ceftazidime. The patient's family recently discussed his goals of care and overall state with him, and despite his poor prognosis, he wished to be full code and agressive care. . PMH: 1.

80 year old male with h/o Parkinson's, recently admitted for CAP discharged on levofloxacin (also had ARF during last admission), who presents from home via EMS s/p syncopal event and abdominal pain.  His wife reports that this am, he c/o "gassy" abdominal pain and when she pressed on his stomach, it was extremely firm. She gave him something OTC for gas which helped minimally with pain.  She noted that he had a black tarry colored loosely formed BM x1 at home following his syncopal event.  She reports he has not been febrile nor coughing at home.  She denies him having trouble swallowing and states she has not noticed him coughing after eating or drinking.  She does, however, note that she uses a blender for his food.  He denies chest pain to her. He has had no nausea/vomiting, but his wife reports poor PO and decreased UOP x several days.  After the syncopal event and black stool, he was brought to the ED for further evaluation. In ED where initial vitals were T 96.5 HR 100s  BP 80/32 RR 16 O2 sat 100% on RA.  His lactate was originally found to be 3.8 which decreased to 1.3 with IVFs and WBC count was elevated to 14.1 with 88% neutrophils.  CXR revealed large hiatal hernia, and CT abd revealed large hiatal hernia, concern for stomach incarceration versus volvulus and possible TE fistula. He received 500mg IV levofloxacin x1, flagyl 500mg IV x1 and 1U prbcs. ED staff was unable to pass NGT and surgery was consulted for further evaluation of stomach incarceration vs. volvulus.  Pt. has a known paraesophageal hernia which he declined to have repaired in [**8-12**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  An UGI with revealed organoaxial volvulus without e/o obstruction as contrast passed through the stomach.  Additionally, GI was consulted prior to surgery, but given inability to pass NGT and in the setting of possible incarceration vs. volvulus, further endoscopic eval. was postponed. Hct on presentation was found to be 30.8 and he received 1U prbc with f/u hct 11hours later of 29.2. 
This is an 84-year-old gentleman who was seen at an outside hospital who complained abdominal pain.  During that time he also underwent an episode of hypertension and chest pain.  It was found that he had a severe myocardial infarction and an elevation in his troponin.  His abdominal pain was then evaluated.  On admission to that hospital it was found that the patient had a perforated diverticulitis. The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further management.  The patient had a long hospice care which will be detailed subsequently. 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 11594**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with a history of HTN who presents with SOB and fever. She went to her PCP yesterday with complaint of several days of SOB and non productive cough. She did not have wheezes and was not hypoxic. She was given amoxicillin for suspected bronchitis. Tonight she presented to the ED due to progressive respiratory distress. . In the ED, initial vs were: T 101.5 HR 88 BP 160/110 RR24 O2Sat:100. The patient was tachypneic and very wheezy despite no COPD/asthma history. She received nebs and methylprednisolone. A chest X ray showed an opacity so she was given ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. Given poor response to above, she was placed on BiPAP and was noted to have a breif episode of hypotension to the 70s which resolved with 500 cc NS bolus. She was sent for a CTA, which revealed a moderate pericardial effusion showing effusive constrictive pattern but no tamponade. An echo was obtained which showed a moderate pericardial effusion without signs of tampenade. The patient also had a run of SVT to 150s, which converted with adenosine. She also complained of some intermittient abdominal discomfort, but her abdomen was soft and she was guaiac negative. Vitals prior to transfer were: 99 136/78 24 100% on 100% FiO2 BiPAP . On review of systems, she states that she fell out of her bed 3 days ago due to "weakness." She denies hitting her head or hurting herself, but was on the floor for a while before she could get help. She also admits to poor PO intake due to anorexia and chills for the last week.

55 y/o female with progressive chest pain. EKG changes in ER. Sent for Cardiac Cath. 
Briefly, this is a 74-year-old man who has had a history of a stent to his proximal RCA back in [**3434**] after noting new chest pain and a positive exercise stress test.  Since then, he has been feeling fairly well until several months prior to admission when he began to notice significant dyspnea on exertion.  He noticed these symptoms after walking up small hills or after several flights of stairs.  Along with his shortness of breath, he occasionally noted mild chest pressure, although it was significantly less than the pain he had felt prior to his RCA stent.  He also reports feeling extremely fatigued and has not been able to be nearly as active as her normally was.  A nuclear stress test was done [**3441-6-23**].  The patient did develop chest discomfort and the ECG was notable for [**Street Address(2) 11595**] depressions anterolaterally.  For this, he was referred to outpatient cardiac catheterization and on [**3441-6-5**], the patient underwent a coronary angiography that demonstrated a right dominant system with two vessel disease. Th[**Last Name (STitle) 11596**] was normal.  The proximal LAD was normal.  There was a 50% mild LAD lesion.  D3 had a 90% stenosis at its origin. The medium sized septal vessel had no flow limiting disease. There was a 50% ostial left circumflex lesion and diffuse mild disease in the proximal vessel up to 30% before OM1. There was 50% ostial lesion of the RCA.  The proximal RCA had diffuse mild disease up to 40% with 50% lesion.  There was an 80% stenosis of the origin of the PDA.  The ejection fraction was estimated at 68% and no mitral regurgitation or stenosis was noted.  The patient was noted to have mild aortic stenosis.  Given these findings of two vessel coronary artery disease, mild aortic stenosis with a normal ejection fraction and a non hemodynamically significant circumflex disease, the patient underwent rotational atherectomy and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the D3 lesion and successful direct stenting of the mid LAD.  He was subsequently referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for coronary artery bypass grafting.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11623**] is a [**Age over 90 **] -year-old right handed male with no significant medical history who was found on the floor in his home by his wife, around thirty minutes after she had last seen him.  EMTs were called who noted decreased responsiveness and garbled speech, and a left sided weakness.  He was brought to the [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].  An imaging scan was performed which showed an acute right middle cerebral infarct.  He was treated with TPA and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. On examination, he was found to be lethargic, following simple commands, oriented, but not attentive.  He had a right gaze preference, but was able to cross the midline. He had a left flaccid hemiparesis as well as decreased response to left visual threat.  Sensory examination was intact.  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11623**] remained stable and the superior branch of the right middle cerebral artery was seen on repeat perfusion scanning to the patient.  He was transferred to the General Neurology floor on [**3132-4-7**]. There he was found to have a large left subgaleal hematoma as well as left arm hematoma. His chest sounds were clear, heart sounds regular.  Abdomen: soft.  Extremities without edema.  He again, had a right gaze preference, a left field cut, and his strength on the left was improved.  There was a decreased left nasolabial fold, increased tone throughout.  Left upper greater than lower extremity weakness.  Sensory examination was intact to all modalities.  Coordination was intact. A repeat head CT scan showed an evolving right MCA infarct, but no significant mass effect.  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11623**] remained stable.  Physical therapy was started and he was screened for rehabilitation.  An echocardiogram was obtained which showed an ejection fraction of 50% to 55%, moderate dilatation of the left atrium, mild dilatation of the right atrium, and a septal atrial defect.  There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal right ventricular systolic function.  Aortic root is mildly dilated and there were focal calcifications in the aortic root.  There is +1 mitral regurgitation, +3 tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Initially, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11623**] was placed on heparin; however, his hematocrit fell precipitously due to bleeding from his hematoma.  The heparin was stopped and several days later, Coumadin as well as Lovenox were started for prophylactic anticoagulation. 
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with past medical history of right MCA stroke times three years ago with residual left hemiparesis.  He presents with generalized tonic seizure around 15 minutes while at home this evening.  His wife stated that he was in his usual state of good health when he seemed "more tired" than usual.  He took a nap and afterward walked around, although seemed a little groggy.  The patient was then noted to start shaking all over his arms and legs.  EMS was called the patient was observed for 15 minutes.  He was given 5 mg of Valium IVP with resolution of seizure activity.  EMS notes that he was able to move his head afterward when his name was called. The patient was also noted to be in atrial fibrillation which was new.  The patient was incontinent of stool.  On the way to the emergency room the patient started to seize again and again was loaded with Valium 2.5 mg with resolution of seizure.  In the E.D. he was given Ativan 2 mg, fentanyl, lidocaine and succinylcholine and was intubated.  He received ceftriaxone 2 gm empirically, vanco 1 gm, started on an insulin drip.  Prior to sedation the patient was minimally responsive, would attempt to move his right arm, open his eyes to sternal rub.  LP was attempted and was initially unsuccessful.  The patient was admitted to the MICU for further workup of new seizure and loaded with Dilantin. 
asked to eval this 58 year old african american male who is taking ASA 81 mg daily with c/o of HA x 3 days.  CT demonstrates acute on subacute sdh on the right side with MLS 1.2cm.  No obvious mass lesion is noted.  Pt lethargic at present and most of history taken from brother who is at bedside.  Pt was out with family on friday and HA was severe enough that they drove him home.  Brother states that pt did not remember the ride home. There are no reprots of sz or LOC nor of any trauma. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11636**] is a 79 year-old right handed [**Location 7877**] man with a history including left parieto-occipital hemorrhage ([**2732**]) with residual right homonymous hemianopia and aphasia (expressive>receptive), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and seizures who presents with a acute right-sided weakness for whom a code stroke was called. . According to the patient and his family, he was in his usual state of health until 12:30 pm on the day of evaluation.  It is unclear what he was doing at that time; his son denies preceding sexual activity, agitation, and head trauma. However, at that time, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11636**] did notice the sudden onset of right upper extremity weakness.  He sought help from his wife and sat down. Within 10 minutes, he developed right leg weakness.  The weakness might have been associated with sensory change in the right extremities.  The family called for help and he was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaluation.  By the time of his arrival, he was noted to have a right facial droop.  Although he has a baseline aphasia in which he has slightly limited comprehension with word-finding difficulties and non-fluent speech, his speech production seemed to be increasingly impaired.  A fingerstick was 112.  A code stroke was called at 1:20 pm. . A non-contrast CT of the head was already in progress two minutes later at the time of the consult.  The initial NIHSS score was 17 (2 loc questions, 2 right homonymous hemianopia, 2 right facial palsy, 8 complete right hemiplegia, 1 decreased sensation to pinprick in right extremities, 1 aphasia, 1 dysarthria), although baseline is estimated to be an NIHSS score of 5.  The non-contrast CT of the head revealed a left predominantly frontal hemorrhage.  He was not considered a tPA candidate due to the intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

This patient was transferred from the medical service to the surgical service on [**2574-2-10**], postoperatively.  She is a 62 year old female with a history of sarcoidosis with pulmonary involvement and hepatic involvement who was initially admitted to the medical service on [**2574-2-1**], with a five day history of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea and a one day history of epigastric pain. Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed at the time showed a thickened gallbladder with a common bile duct of 1.2 centimeters and elevated liver enzymes.  Of note, her liver enzymes have been elevated in the past.  She underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which showed portal hypertensive gastropathy and compression of the portal vein by the common bile duct without any stones. She was treated with antibiotics and then underwent a MRCP. She continued to have crampy abdominal pain and a CT scan of the abdomen was performed on [**2574-2-3**], which showed ascites and a large ventral hernia. She was seen by the hepatology service at this point regarding operative risks for possible hernia repair.  The hepatology consult suggested 30% risk mortality and also suggested conservative treatment with Actigall, Aldactone and paracentesis. She continued to have emesis and a nasogastric tube was placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 513**] on [**2574-2-4**].  She continued to have high nasogastric output and pain and nausea and then underwent an upper gastrointestinal and small bowel follow through on [**2574-2-9**], which revealed high grade ileal obstruction.  At this point, the decision was made to operate on her and she was subsequently transferred to the surgical service postoperatively.

46yo F with h/o atypical CP, and chest heaviness, COPD and recent diagnosis of "anomalous coronary artery" transferred from OSH for further evaluation and management of her chest pain in the setting of this anomalous vessel.  She reports that over the past 1-2 months, she has developed progressively worsening chest pressure (not described as pain, but rather describes as sensation of "someone sitting on chest" and "suffocating") to the point that it is constantly present.  She notes worsening of the pressure intermittently (every few days) at which time she develops chest pain that radiates to her left arm.  She does not note that this happens at any particular time and reports it seems "random" and can occur both at rest or with exertion.  She does, however, notice it more at night when she is lying flat. She states that the exacerbations (when heaviness becomes pain) are freq. associated with shortness of breath, nausea and diaphoresis.  The chest pain episodes are often self limited, but she reports that she developed anterior, substernal chest pressure today with pain in the left shoulder assoc. w/ the above symptoms today while at rest.  The symptoms did not resolve on their own and, thus, she presented to [**Hospital3 **] ED. . Of note, she was cathed recently at [**Hospital3 **] that did not show flow-limiting coronary artery disease but did reveal anomalous takeoff of one of the coronaries (? RCA). A CTA performed in NH reportedly confirms this). She was supposed to have been cathed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11113**] on Tuesday, but this did not happen for unclear reason. . In the ED at [**Hospital3 **], initial vitals revealed T 97.6 BP 115/72 P 90 R 18 O2sat 98%RA.  EKG revealed NSR at rate of [**Street Address(2) 12431**] depression in V3-V6 as well as II, III, and aVF (reportedly during CP).  She received IV morphine 4mg x2, NTP which improved her CP to her baseline "heaviness", and later reglan for "indigestion".  CXR was performed which was normal per OSH report.  BNP was sent which was 33 where normal range is 5-100.  CEs were reportedly negative, but I do not see the actual results in her tx paperwork.

An esophagogastroduodenoscopy study, upper GI study showed duodenitis, contact bleeding noted and Epinephrine injection into the site of contact bleeding gave successful hemostasis. A colonoscopy done on [**12-3**] that showed non bleeding diverticula in her large bowel and a transthoracic echo that showed a greater than normal AV gradient.  Also an EF of a greater than 55% and she had a chest x-ray that showed an incidental finding of a right hilar mass.  She had a follow-up CT of her chest that showed a hilar mass that was 2.4 cm long on its long axis. HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 69-year-old woman with obesity, prosthetic mechanic AVR on Coumadin, osteoarthritis, four days prior to admission the patient syncopated without head trauma.  After loss of consciousness of short duration, that is, less than 5 minutes, the patient was unable to rise, attributing this to fatigue, and remained prone overnight; overnight she noted bright red blood per rectum plus melena; she did not call EMS out of embarrassment regarding her situation and body habitus.  Later (after approximately 24-36 hours down), answering a phone call from a friend who arranged for ambulance pick-up.  She was taken to [**Hospital3 12880**], noted to have bright red blood per rectum, a hematocrit of 23.5, troponin I of less than 0.3, given a transfusion of packed red blood cells, given normal saline, and was nasogastric tube lavage negative.  She was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] MICU on [**11-27**] and she denied chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, fever, chills, back pain, confusion or recent weight loss.  She has no prior history of bleeds. However, patient is status post aortic valve replacement with mechanical valve, on Coumadin, and had not had a follow-up visit for approximately one year.  Her INR on admission to the [**Hospital1 69**] MICU was approximately 6.  She had a right IJ line placed under ultrasound guidance.  Coumadin was discontinued.  Vitamin K was given.  She received fresh frozen plasma and over a two day period, 11 units of packed red blood cells.  Nasogastric tube study lavage was positive for red blood on [**11-28**]; her hematocrit has been stable at 30 or greater since the morning of [**11-30**].  She had an EGD that showed gastroduodenitis. Contact bleeding was noted and Epinephrine injection gave successful hemostasis.  Gastritis and a large antral clot that went unroofed did not reveal bleeding ulcer were noted. She had an IV contrast bleeding scan that showed no active bleeding source.  She ruled out for MI by EKG and cardiac enzymes.  For her higher than normal AV gradient, it was planned to reevaluate with TEE (transesophageal echo) when patient stable.  Now that patient is stable, she does not want the study performed during this admission siting the stresses of her hospital course.  On pulmonary the patient had some upper airway mucous suctioned in advanced of the EGD procedure.  Because of body habitus and prior history, the patient was a concern for aspiration.  The patient had no complaints of shortness of breath or dyspnea in the hospital. However, she was put on aspiration precautions.  Also, as mentioned under images, there was an incidental finding on chest x-ray, that of a right hilar mass.  A follow-up chest CT showed a hilar mass with a long axis of 2.4 cm in the

[**Name (NI) **] pt increasingly agitated and placed on CIWA scale as there was concern for ETOH withdrawal. CIWA >20 early [**3-17**] am. He received total 8 mg ativan since midnight and 17 mg haldol. Pt gradually more stridorous, Sat 96-98% on rebreather. ENT at bedside 2pm [**3-17**] and examined pt airway (significant obstruction of airway by posterior pharyngeal wall and notable edema). Code blue called, anesthesia fiberoptically intubated pt orally. Pt sats maintained and HD stable. Pt subsequently transferred to SICU for further care. . In the SICU: The patient was started on a CIWA scale, and intermittant ativan, in addition to decadron. Over the following days, the decadron was tapered as was his sedation. A CTA of his neck demonstrated no acute changes and resolving pharygeal edema. he was extubated on [**3-24**], taken off the steroids. Despite discontinuing the steroids, the patient continues to have a significant leukocytosis, was febrile and, as a result, was placed on Vanc/Cipro with cultures taken of blood, urine and wound. Cipro and Vanc were started on the 19th. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 12890**] is a 68 year old man with history of cervical spondylysis and disc degeneration who underwent C4-C7 discectomies and C4-C7 spinal stabilization on [**2589-3-16**].

Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 54 year old gentleman with a history of supraventricular tachycardia, hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia who was transferred from [**Doctor Last Name 1248**] Hospital to [**Hospital6 253**] [**3005-12-12**] for failure to wean from ventilator and persistent fevers.  Please see [**Doctor Last Name 1248**] Hospital discharge summary for further details of his initial presentation and hospital course there. In brief, he presented to [**Doctor Last Name 1248**] Hospital [**3005-11-30**] complaining of shortness of breath for two days following a recent upper respiratory tract infection two weeks prior to admission.  On admission he was tachypneic to the 40s, hypoxic to 93% on 100% nonrebreather, tachycardiac to 180 and hypotensive.  Labs were notable for a white blood count of 5 with 49% neutrophils and 40% bands.  Chest x-ray revealed left lower lobe and possibly right lower lobe infiltrates. Blood cultures grew out six out of six bottles with Streptococcus pneumoniae.  He was begun empirically on Unasyn and the Azithromycin which was subsequently switched to Vancomycin when an organism was identified.  On [**12-3**], he was switched to Penicillin when the organism was found to be pansensitive.  Despite therapy, he continued to spike fevers to 101 to 102 on a daily basis despite subsequent cultures being negative.  He had an exhaustive workup for alternative etiology of his persistent fevers including right upper quadrant ultrasound which was negative for cholecystitis, lower extremity noninvasives which were negative for deep vein thrombosis, chest computerized tomography scan which was negative for empyema.  An echocardiogram was negative for endocarditis.  He did have a head computerized axial tomography scan which revealed sinusitis.  Gram stain and cultures of sputum and nasal swabs revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa and so Levofloxacin was added to his regimen.  On [**12-11**], per Infectious Disease consult recommendation, Penicillin and Levofloxacin were discontinued and he was switched to Ceftazidime and Gentamicin to treat his pneumococcal pneumonia and Pseudomonas sinusitis.  On the day of transfer, he was also started on empirically on Flagyl and p.o. Vancomycin for oppression of Clostridium difficile, however, Clostridium difficile toxin subsequently returned negative.  Despite all of these treatments, he continued to spike fevers on a daily basis. His hospital course at [**Doctor Last Name 1248**] was also notable for respiratory failure.  He was intubated on admission for hypoxic respiratory failure which was felt to be due to his pneumonia, presumably from pneumococcus, although this organism was never cultured from his sputum, only from his blood.  It is not clear whether he was attempted to be weaned from the ventilator, but he required persistent sedation, due to tachypnea to the 50s and desaturation whenever attempts at weaning sedation were made. His tachycardia and hypotension on admission was felt likely due to sepsis.  His hemodynamics stabilized with fluids, Dopamine, and antibiotics by hospital day #3 and he was able to be weaned off of Dopamine at that time.  He ruled out for a myocardial infarction and echocardiogram [**12-9**] revealed ejection fraction of 75% with mild left ventricular hypokinesis. Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital6 1991**] [**3005-12-12**] for persistent fevers and inability to wean from the ventilator. 
The pt is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with a history of AD. lives in a nursing home. Had a witnessed GTC x3 min. EMS called, came back to baseline. EMS noted another GTC x3 min. Ativan 2mg given. At OSH GTC x2, 2mg Ativan and dilantin load given 1g. Intubated for airway protection. Was given two different paralytic. Here seen initially off propofol. Not following commands and intubated. At baseline, pt is able to feed herself and walk with a walker. Is unable to carry on a conversation "she just repeats herself and talks about how much she loves her kids".  4 days prior to admission, she was diagnosed with a URI because of cough and fever for one day to 99.0 (initially thought to be PNA, but had a CXR that did not show an opacification) and put on ABx (? which one).  She was sleepy and eating less until the day prior to admission when she was able to walk with a walker to the dining room.  Per her daughter she was "back to baseline" the day prior to admission but then when her daughter was leaving, pt had an episode of "slurred speech and speaking nonsense". Pt's daughter became concerned, and told the nurses she thought that her mother may have had a stroke.  She then got a phone call that 5 mins after that episode, pt had had a seizure.  EMS called, pt came back to baseline. However, EMS noted another GTC x3 min. Ativan 2mg given. Pt was brought to an OSH where she had two more GTCs.  She was given 2mg Ativan and 1gram of dilantin load given.  Patient was intubated for airway protection and sent to [**Hospital1 18**].  When here, pt was found to have an alcohol level of 129.  When asked about alcohol level, pt's family was shocked, reported that pt has no access to alcohol and has "never liked alcohol, she doesn't drink". . 
Mrs. [**Known patient firstname **] [**Known patient lastname 13086**] is a 86 year old female with a history of breast cancer, DM, HTN, CKD Stage III/IV, PVD, HCC and cirrhosis who presents with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. The pt reports that she has had abdominal pain for weeks, but that on [**4-8**] after eating lunch the pain got so bad "that she couldn't stand it anymore" and was "shooting across the stomach." The pt had never had pain similar to this before. Currently her pain is a constant dull pain that is diffuse. In the ED, the patient's daughter reported that her mother had no fevers at home but had been having chills. On arrival to the floor the pt developed nausea and non-bloody vomiting, but had not had these symptoms prior. Pt's dtr denied any altered mental status. She did report some diarrhea, no melena or constipation. The patient also reports that she has had some dyspnea on exertion recently, unable to relate how long. She currently feels like she is "panting." . In the ED, triage vital signs were: 98.2 66 117/39 16 100% 2L. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed, which was positive for SBP. RUQ ultrasound showed gallbladder wall thickening and possible acute cholecystitis. Foley was placed. Ceftriaxone, flagyl, morphine and zofran were given. Cipro was started originally, but pt began to develop "red blotches" ([**Name8 (MD) **] RN notes) so cipro was stopped. Transplant surgery saw the patient and recommended an ICU bed for monitoring of SBP and broad spectrum abx for SBP and UTI, as well as HIDA scan to further evaluate for cholecytitis. . . On floor, patient began vomiting, reported mild shortness of breath and reports that her abdominal pain is improving. . Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, night sweats. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied cough. Denied chest pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias 
49 yo male with newly diagnosed aorta to RV fistula with longstanding history of VSD and now a ruptured sinus of Valsalva. he has had progressively elevated PA pressures and now presents for surgical repair. 
This very pleasant 29-year-old woman had a temporary loss of consciousness following a fall from a chair.  She also had experienced increasing left-sided headaches for many months. A computed tomography scan of the head was obtained.  This showed a left-sided frontal skull lesion.  A magnetic resonance imaging scan was then obtained.  This showed a likely hemangioma.  This had completely infiltrated through the inner table of the skull and had expanded the diploic space.  There was a small amount of the outer table of the skull remaining. The patient's headaches had been progressive and disabling. She states that for some time she has been able to hear her heart beat in her left hear.  She also has had pain in the region of her temporomandibular joint dysfunction. 
This is a 72 year-old gentleman with a history of a large anterior wall myocardial infarction in [**3143-7-17**] who has been experiencing shortness of breath and substernal chest tightness over the last month.  An echocardiogram performed on [**10-19**] revealed an ejection fraction of 20 to 25% with severe hypokinesis of the anterolateral walls, trace aortic regurgitation and 1+ mitral regurgitation.  The patient was referred for cardiac catheterization on [**11-9**], which showed an ejection fraction of 35%, a 30% left main osteal lesion, 90% mid vessel left anterior descending coronary artery lesion involving a large diagonal, a 60% osteal circumflex lesion and a 50% osteal right coronary artery lesion.  The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] for coronary artery bypass grafting. 
The patient is a 69 year old female who was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital6 643**] with acute renal failure.  She was taken to the Operating Room and found to have bilateral ureteral obstruction at the base of her bladder from presumably a bladder primary carcinoma.  This was biopsied and it was a little indecisive as to wether this was a bladder primary or a gynecologic primary cancer.  Either way, the recommendations were to proceed to the Operating Room for an anterior exenteration.  This is what she did and this is what this admission is for. 
76y.o. male with previous episode of CP and ETT consistent with an inferiour septal fixed defect, hyperlipidemia and GERD presented to [**Location (un) 614**] on [**3312-11-19**] c/o chest pain - intense, retro-sternal, radiating into the back. His CP lasted for about 3 hrs and started after eating spicy food. Pt also had a similar episode of lesser severity in the evening prior to admission when he took Protonix + Tums with some relief. In [**Name (NI) **], pt received nitro x2, ASA and Lopressor 5mg iv with very mild relief. Also was given GI coctail (Maalox + viscus Lidocaine) with some additional improvement. After an hour or so, his CP subsided and pt remained pain-free since then. ECG in ED showed 1mm ST depression in lateral leads. Normal CXR. Initial CK was 75, MB 1.6, trop >0.2. Second set of enzymes - CK 223, MB 20.9, trop 9.4. Pt was started on Nitro drip and the decision was made to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for a cath lab. 
The pt is a 58 year-old woman with hypothyroidism and atrial fibrillation discovered in [**Month (only) 944**] during screening colonoscopy. She was initially electively admitted for an atrial fibrillation ablation procedure and pacemaker placement on [**2513-6-29**].  The ablation procedure was apparently unsuccessful, but pacemaker was placed. The following history is that obtained on transfer to the Neurology Service on [**2513-6-30**]. On hospital day two, the pt developed acute onset of diplopia while she was on the floor, the morning after the procedure.  A Code Stroke was called and the stroke fellow saw her immediately.  She noted an aphasia and brought the pt immediately to the CT scanner.  En route and at the scanner, the patient became noticeably worse, with the development of right arm plegia and a question of sensory deficits over her hand as well.  She also had a left gaze deviation, a right facial droop, mild dysarthria, and some disorientation.  Her NIHSS was 11 Her CT showed no hemorrhage/bleed.  She then had a CTA which showed no major vessel cut-off, but did have decreased apparent branch perfusion of the left posterior frontal lobe.  Her INR was 1.1. She was taken to the ICU and tpA was administered.  Her deficits improved afterwards, with improvement in her gaze deviation, speech, and arm strength.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 13181**] is a 68 y/o male with a history of CAD s/p 2.5 X 18mm Cypher DES in the LAD in [**2940**] and POBA to med LAD for restenosis in [**2942**], HTN, and HLD who presented with sudden onset substernal chest pain. He states that he was in his USOH at home when he suddenly developed chest pain and became diaphoretic after he was making a grilled cheese [**Location (un) 5927**]. The pain was located in the middle of his chest but did not radiate. He describes the pain as intense/sharp and was a [**6-20**] at its worst. He walked to his wife and told her to call the ambulance. When EMS arrived he was given nitroglycerin tabs x2 which helped with the pain. They took an EKG and were concerned for ST elevations therefore they called the ED with this concern. . In the ED a code STEMI was called and he was quickly transferred to the cath lab. EKG showed a HR of 75 with hyperacute T waves and anterior ST elevations. He was given aspirin 325mg and plavix 300mg. His trop was noted to be 0.43. In the cath lab he a 3.0 x 30 mm Resolute stent was deployed in his LAD. The thombus migrated to the distal LAD and the patient became temporarily bradycardic and hypotensive which was reversed with IV Atropine. Intermittent slow flow was noted again and massive amount of thrombus was noted in the LMCA, proximal LAD with some protrusion into the Cx creating a "trap door" effect in the LAD as the thrombus moved.  A 4.0 x 18 mm Resolute stent was deployed in the LAD and LMCA. After removal of the radial sheath, he complained of worsening chest pain an he was noted to have extensive STE in the anterior precordium.  It was decided that confirmatory angiography would be repeated to ensure that the vessels were patent and IABP was inserted. . Patient states that when he was previously intervened he did not have any symptoms. He notes that the first intervention was done becuase of an abnormal stress test. He has never had chest pain before. . On arrival to the floor, patient was awake and alert but was having some continued chest pain. He rated the pain as a [**3-21**]. The pain was the same pain he presented with however the intesity is better. . REVIEW OF SYSTEMS On review of systems, he denied any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denied recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. 
60 y/o female with gastric bypass in [**3156**], PUD, sent in to ED by PCP for evaluation of epigastric pain x 2 weeks. She states that she has chronic pain near her right upper quadrant, felt to be related to her ulcer disease. 2 weeks ago, she reported that she developed a new pain in her left lower quadrant. She was told his may be diverticulosis, and was treated conservatively and without antibiotics. Subsequently, in the past few days, she reports that she developed an acute on chronic pain in the epigastric/RUQ region. She had a "popcorn" feeling and never had pain like this before. She presented to PCP and was sent to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 614**]. Prior to her [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 614**] admission, she had CT abdomen at [**Hospital 4008**] Hospital without acute process. At [**Name (NI) **], pt had 300cc of hematemesis, and on transfer an additional 3-4 episodes of hematemesis (? 500 cc in total). Has had continued hematemesis in route and here. Guaiac neg from below brown stool. Hct 36.5 (3:30 pm today) to 29 here. Of note, she has never had hematemesis before. In the ED, initial VS -  7, 98, 70, 117/64, 24, 100% 2L NC.

Patient intubated and history is per report and record review. Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with fever and productive cough. The cough started 3 weeks ago and has been productive of green sputum, and associated with mild shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting (attributed to Gleevec), and fatigue. She saw her oncologist on [**3482-9-19**] for a followup, was afebrile with O2 sat 91,RA, and was noted to have a WBC of 11.2. She was started on azithromycin and advised to return to clinic in 3 days. Today, she noted difficulty breathing and fevers/chills/night sweats, as well as cough, with symptoms worse the past two days. She also reports anorexia and [**5-14**]# wt loss. Her O2 sat was noted to be 86 on RA, improving to 95 on 3L NC. Blood cultures and flu swab were obtained and she was referred to the ED. . In the ED, her initial vitals were: 99.5 88 120/76 28 96% on 5L NC. On exam, she was dry with diminished breath sounds and right sided crackles, and tachycardia. A CT of the chest was ordered looking for possible PCP and showed evidence of infection with multifocal airspace opacities. She was started on vancomycin and aztreonam, in addition to continuing her current azithromycin. While in the ED, her respiratory status worsened, becoming more tachypneic and hypoxic requiring intubation. Her recent vitals (prior to intubation) show RR 32, HR 124, 127/83 and O2 sat of 76,RA -> 96,3L. She received 4L IVF in the ED. Cannot perform ROS as pt is intubated and sedated. 
This is a 41 year old man with end stage renal disease, dementia, hypertension, type II diabetes, change in mental status five days prior to his admission.  At hemodialysis, the patient was noted to have low grade fevers.  Blood cultures were drawn and he was given Vancomycin and Gentamycin doses times one.  On arrival to the Emergency Room, the patient was found to have a right lower lobe consolidation and he was given one dose of Levaquin. The patient was found to be in altered mental status. Subsequently, his psychiatric medications were held.  His Levofloxacin was started on hospital day number two for possible pneumonia.  By hospital day number three, the patient became increasingly lethargic and febrile to 101.5. At this time, the patient became hypotensive his systolic blood pressures dropped to the 70's.  The patient's blood pressure responded to intravenous fluids and he was given Vancomycin and Flagyl.  On hospital day number four, the patient again became hypotensive and was sent to the Intensive Care Unit and given aggressive hydration. In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was given Vancomycin and Flagyl for suspected aspiration pneumonia.  At that time, the patient also had increasing rigors and muscle tone, thought to possibly be secondary to his psychiatric medications. In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was placed on pressors and intravenous fluids.  He was given Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  A lumbar puncture was performed without evidence of infection.  Once the blood pressure was stabilized, the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 138**] Medicine Floor. 
This is a 58 year old gentleman who fell in his home on [**11-14**], with questionable loss of consciousness and was seen at [**Hospital3 7272**].  The patient had an initial trauma evaluation and was noted to have raccoon eyes and left hemotympanum.  He was moving all fours and was hemodynamically stable.  He had a left chest tube placed at [**Hospital1 3546**] for hemothorax.  He was then transferred to the [**Hospital6 253**] for additional evaluation workup. There was no known past medical history, no home medications and no known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or alcohol. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initial vital signs were blood pressure 133/81, heartrate 98, respiratory rate 21, saturation 96% on room air.  On initial examination he had equal, round and reactive pupils, bilateral raccoon eyes and left hemotympanum.  His lungsounds were clear bilaterally with somewhat coarse breathsounds at the left side.  Heart was regular rate, S1 and S2.  On logroll, no areas of tenderness or stepoff were noted along the spine.  He had a soft, nontender, nondistended abdomen.  On rectal there was normal tone and guaiac negative brown stool.  Lower extremities were warm and well perfused, with palpable pulses and no gross deformities.  The left elbow was noted to be tender with no deformity.  He was moving all fours and was oriented times three. LABORATORY DATA:  Initial laboratory work was as follows - Complete blood count, white count 14.8, hematocrit 42.6, platelet count 222.  Chem-7, sodium 144, potassium 4.3, chloride 109, carbon dioxide 26, BUN 16, creatinine 0.7, and glucose 156.  Coagulation screen, PT 12.8, PTT 22.7, INR 1.0, lactate was 2.1.  Serum toxicology screen was positive for opiates as well as benzodiazepines.  Urinalysis was negative. Imaging - Trauma chest x-ray showed left-sided rib fractures at a left chest tube with appropriate positioning, no pneumothorax appreciated.  Coarse appearance of the pulmonary parenchyma which may be due to aspiration versus technique. Pelvis film shows no fractures.  Noncontrast head computerized tomography scan showed extensive subarachnoid bleb within the right frontal lobe sulci and right sylvian fissure.  There was accompanying hemorrhagic contusion in the adjacent portions of the right frontal and temporal lobes. There was a small adjacent subdural near the right pterion. Moderate compression of the right lateral ventricle was noted as well as a few mm of leftward shift at the third ventricle. There was probable hemorrhagic content within the left maxillary sinus and left sphenoid air cell.  The left tympanic cavity and external auditory canal were filled with soft tissue density.  A small amount of emphysema was noted within the left masticator space.  A lesion of the left superior ophthalmic vein was noted.  This finding in addition to some bulging in the left cavernous sinus was suspicious for the presence of a left carotid cavernous fistula. Impression of the computerized tomography scan was extensive intracranial hemorrhage as well as probable skull base fractures with findings suspicious for the presence of a left carotid cavernous fistula.  Computerized tomography scan of the facial bones and base of the skull showed a linear fracture of the mastoid and petrous portions of the left temporal bone.  There was also subtle fracture in the region of the pterygoid plates and left inferior lateral aspect of the sphenoid sinus.  There was a small fracture of the posterior aspect of the left maxillary sinus.  The patient had magnetic resonance imaging scan/magnetic resonance angiography of the head which showed bilateral dilation of the superior ophthalmic veins, but no distinct carotid cavernous fistula.  This study was followed up with four vessel angiogram which was negative.  Other injuries noted during radiologic examination included a left C7 transverse process fracture, a T2 spinous process fracture, and a left maldisplaced acromion fracture. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Trauma Intensive Care Unit with q. one hour neurologic checks.  He was loaded with Dilantin and his blood pressure was closely monitored with a goal systolic below 140.  His coagulation studies were followed with a goal INR below 1.3.  His head bleeds were followed with serial computerized tomography scan.  The amount of intravenous fluids was carefully limited to prevent cerebellar edema.  In the unit he was started on Decadron 6 intravenously q. 6.  He was also started on

Pt's history and hospital course reviewed. Briefly, this is a 52M w/ h/o HIV who p/w 3 days of anuria and general malaise. He had been having diarrhea for the past 6 weeks and on presentation to the ED for his anuria, he was found to be hypotensive to 84/60 and in ARF with Cr 5.7 (baseline 1.0). He also complained of left-sided chest discomfort, a substernal pressure radiating across his chest that had been ongoing for 2-3 weeks. Sepsis protocol was initiated and RSC CVL was placed. BP improved to SBP of 100 with 4L IVF and IV heparin was started for troponin leak of 0.11. He was transferred to the MICU. . While in the MICU, the patient's ARF responded well to IVF, with his Cr decreasing to 1.8 on transfer to the floor. TnT decreased from 0.11 to 0.02. However, TTE showed a markedly dilated RV cavity and moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis consistent with RV pressure/volume overload. The patient's pretest probability for PE was considered high given his HIV status, chest pain, and TTE results, but a V/Q scan showed low probability. Given his post-test estimated probability of PE was 20%, he was continued on anticoagulation. Hct drop from 33.8 on admission to 26.1 after fluid resuscitation with guaiac positive stool, hypovolemia, likely demand ischemia, and h/o abnormal EGD raised strong suspicion for GIB, but his Hct returned to 33.3 by time of transfer to floor. His platelets dropped from 160 on admission to 97, and HIT antibody test was positive [**10-13**], so he was switched to argatroban. On the day of transfer, the pt spiked a low-grade temperature to 100.7. He was pan-cultured but no antibiotics were started as there was no clear infectious source.

The patient was transferred from [**Hospital6 11956**] to [**Hospital1 186**] complaining of bilateral leg pain and weakness for the last few weeks.  At baseline, he ambulates with a cane.  He had fallen on [**3268-5-17**], sliding from his bed to the floor. He had cervical spine injury after fall six years ago. Within the hospital he was diagnosed with pneumonia and given Rocephin and was given Decadron for a question of spinal cord injury. On examination in the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department, he was noticed to have diminished breath sounds on the left  He complained of progressive weakness, ascending from his feet to his hands.  He had rales on the left side of his lungs.  He was complaining of upper respiratory symptoms for the past two weeks.  He appeared to be in respiratory distress and was using accessory muscles for breathing. His right arm was found to be flaccid (baseline) except for two to three wrist extension.  Right and left legs with two over five strength proximally and three to three plus distally.  He is intubated because of respiratory distress and also because he appeared agitated but needed to receive an MRI to rule out spinal cord compression.  He received Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin in the Emergency Department and received 11 liters of fluid resuscitation. 
The patient is a 75 year old right handed male with past medical history notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, history of colon cancer, who presented to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**3162-12-21**], after the onset of speech difficulties and right arm weakness.  He had been helping his wife with the laundry and he suddenly developed slurred speech and difficulty talking. He noticed his right arm was not moving well. On arrival of Emergency Medical Services, he was noted to have weakness of the right arm and leg.  He was taken to the Emergency Department.  He was mildly hypertensive, normal sinus rhythm.  Within fifteen minutes, the leg weakness resolved. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial examination, he was alert and oriented with sparse grammatical speech with paraphasic errors and a mild anomia.  He was unable to repeat.  He had a mild right facial droop and a right pronator drift with distal greater than proximal weakness of the right arm.  He had sensory deficits of the right face, arm, trunk and leg. HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was given TPA at approximately two and one half hours after the symptoms began and then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  Overnight, his symptoms improved.  By the morning of [**3162-12-22**], he had no complaints. Of note, he was apparently seen by his primary care physician in the Emergency Department on [**3162-12-15**], for complaints of shaking in the right arm, slurred speech, had no significant findings on physical examination and was sent home. The patient had a magnetic resonance scan performed that showed abnormal T2 signal hyperintensity within the left frontoparietal junction which involves the [**Doctor Last Name 347**] and white matter consistent with an acute infarct.  There is also an old infarct within the right parietal white matter.  MRA showed visualization of left middle cerebral artery and one segment but no cortical branches. Physical examination on [**3162-12-22**], was improved from that on [**3162-12-21**].  His speech was fluent without paraphasic errors. Repetition was intact.  He has some mild anomia.  His main deficits at this time, he has graphesthesia and stereognosis in the right hand.  He does have a right pronator drift. Finger extensors are 5-/5 on the right with full power in the interossei.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Plantar response is flexion bilaterally.  Finger to nose testing is accurate. The patient then on [**3162-12-22**], underwent a carotid ultrasound and a transthoracic echocardiogram.  The patient was started on Aspirin therapy 325 mg p.o. q.d. Noninvasive carotid study showed narrowing of less than 40% bilaterally of the internal carotid arteries and the patient's transthoracic echocardiogram was within normal limits with no evidence of thrombogenic area.  The Transesophageal Echocardiography service came by on [**3162-12-25**], and documented in the chart that the patient's transthoracic echocardiogram was an adequate study and that there was no indication to proceed to a Transesophageal Echocardiogram as they say based on the clinical scenario and evidence obtained on the transthoracic echocardiogram. The patient will be discharged on [**3162-12-25**], on all his previous home medications which include: 1.  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. 2.  Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.d. 3.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. He will have follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3163-2-26**], at 1:00 p.m.  They will at that time decide whether the patient can drive as he has been told he cannot drive until this visit. They will also decide if the patient needs to undergo a Transesophageal Echocardiogram.

65 year old male presented to [**Hospital3 1265**] Hospital with chest pressure and paplatations at rest for 1 week. He was referred for cardiac catheterization and found to have significant coronary artery disease and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for revascularization. 
50yo F with a h/o CAD, severe PVD, s/p thoracic aorta replacement, COPD, and severe hyperlipidemia admitted to CCU after attempt at revascularization of femoral stent complicated by anaphylactic reaction. Visipaque dye was injected and shortly after pt developed anxiety, increased HR, facial edema, and erythema/flushing. Pt's sBP's when down to the 60's. She was given 1 amp of epinephrine with subsequent sBP's into the 200's and tachycardia. Propofol bolus and gtt and nitro gtt and sBP's decreased again. Nitro was stopped and propofol was decreased and neosynephrine was initiated with IVF. Pt also received solumedrol 125 IV , Benadryl 50, and Pepcid. She was transferred to the CCU for monitoring overnight. Pt underwent a peripheral catheterization on [**2552-11-10**] due to critical limb ischemia.  This revealed total occlusion of the distal SFA, for which she received a stent: overlapping 5.0x30mm Precise and 7.0x100mm and 7.0x38mm Dynalink stents. This intervention followed a failed femoral popliteal bypass in [**2551**].  Her symptoms returned and she was referred for angiogram of this limb with likely revascularization. She reports bilateral leg pain, right greater than left for many years.  The pain is predominantly in the back of her calves.  The onset of the pain is after a half a block.  She reports bilateral ankle swelling, right greater than left.

89 y.o. male with past medical history of prostate cancer (remoted), vascular dementia +/- coexistent Alzheimer's disease, hypothyroidism, and gout who was brought in by ambulance from his nursing home today after being lethargic and found to be hypoxic. At best patient is intermittently recognizing family and somewhat appropriate though also doing things like talking to dolls and wandering. This behavior has dramatically worsened over the past four months so that the patient is now in a [**Hospital1 1483**]. Recently, the family has noted several episodes recently of the patient coughing and sputtering while eating, which raised concern from them that the rehab was feeding him too fast. Therefore, they hired a private individual to feed the patient. That person has noted that the patient was much less responsive and engaged today; the patient was unable to give any history. Because of his dramatically reduced responsiveness the patient was brought in to the ED where initial vitals revealed an O2 sat of 86% on a nonrebreather. SBP dropped into the 50's so the patient had a femoral CVL placed under emergent conditions and he was intubated after being started on norepinephrine. Temp was 96.4 rectal with a lactate of >10. Imaging revealed a right sided infiltrate, EKG w/ NSR w/ slightly peaked T's. The patient received bicarb, calcium, and kayexalate through an orogastric tube. He received pip-tazo and vancomycin for empiric antibiotic coverage. After receiving 2 L of fluids the patient's temp was 96.7, P 100, BP 106/82, RR 30-35, and satting 90-100% on the ventilator. ABG 7.28/35/330 and lactate was down to 5.8. CT head was negative. He was sent to the ICU. On arrival to the ICU the patient is intubated but was initially responding to commands and squeezing fingers. ROS was unobtainable but per family patient had been touching his lower abdomen over the preceding days, which made them concerned for a UTI.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 4163**] is a 48-year-old male resident at Rentham Developmental Center, who has a problem with chronic severe aspiration.  This problem was first noticed around eight years ago.  He had a gastrostomy tube placed in [**2789**].  He continued to have reflux, however, with aspiration and recurrent pneumonia.  In [**2798-6-23**], he developed right pleural effusion.  He had a thoracoscopy and chest tube placement.  The fluid was an exudate with no infection or malignancy. Due to the recurrent nature of the problem, he was scheduled for a tracheoesophageal separation by total laryngectomy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1814**] on [**2798-7-20**].

This is a 57-year-old male with a history of severe COPD who is at baseline on trach/ventilator at night, who is also steroid dependent.  He was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress.  He initially presented to the ER at [**Hospital1 188**] on [**8-29**] with worsening shortness of breath. The patient initially underwent trach placement in [**3484-1-26**] after developing tracheomalacia status post prolonged MICU stay and intubation for COPD and pneumonia.  He was last admitted to an outside hospital on [**3485-7-25**] and discharged on [**3485-8-5**] with COPD and pneumonia.  He was treated with Ceftazidime and steroids and discharged home on a steroid taper, however, he had already finished antibiotic course. He had been doing well until the day prior to admission when he developed worsening shortness of breath, increased oxygen requirements from 3 liters to 6 liters to requiring ventilation at home at rest.  He had positive discordance on the ventilator.  He denied any cough or fevers but had increased sputum output from his trachea.  This consisted of a thick, whitish sputum.  He denied any substernal chest pain but did admit to left sided pleuritic chest discomfort.  On arrival to the ER he was in near respiratory arrest.  The vital signs, temperature was 98, heart rate 120, blood pressure 200/100, satting 47% on 6 liters but with an Ambu bag he was satting at 100%.

85 right-handed man, Cantanese-speaking only, with PMH of dyslipidimia, smoker, probable Alzheimer's disease who woke-up today with frontal headache and very significant change in mental status, being innatentive and with illogical speech, found to have acute left temporal-parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild surrounding edema. On his baseline, patient has short tem memory problems for the past few years (eg. wife says he often forgets what he ate before but he has a good memory for childhood events), he, however, can dress by himself, does not get lost in the streets and he is oriented to time and place. He lives with his wife and his son. Yesterday, he did some gardening work and was well when he went to bed as per his wife. This morning, he woke-up at 5am, his usual time, and complained of frontal headache to his wife. His wife noticed that he was not himself, he did not get his usual morning cup of coffee, he was speaking to himself, he did not respond to her when she asked questions and he was completely incoherent in his speech, illogic. The words he spoke in Cantanese were meaningless, they did not think he had slurred speech. He would say sentences like "I go somewhere" or things they would not understand at all. Daughter and wife reported that they did not find any evidence of weakness, he could hold objects well but his gait was somewhat unsteady, not falling to any side. ROS: Family denied fever, wt loss, appetite changes, cp, palpitations, DOE, sob, cough, wheeze, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abd pain, fecal incont, dysuria, nocturia, urinary incontinence, muscle or joint pain, hot/cold intolerance, polyuria, polydipsia, easy bruising, depression, anxiety, stress, or psychotic sx. 
The patient is a 40 year old gentleman with known bicuspid aortic valve and hepatitis A. The patient had an echocardiogram previously done in [**2695**] which showed mild aortic stenosis and no aortic insufficiency.  On a recent visit with his primary care physician he was noted to have a new heart murmur.  The patient had an echocardiogram done at an outside hospital on [**2703-8-28**] which demonstrated a moderately dilated left aorta and left ventricle with an ejection fraction of approximately 60%.  The patient also had moderately severe aortic insufficiency and mild aortic stenosis.  As a result of this echocardiogram the patient underwent a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging scan on [**2703-10-28**].  The results of the study were as follows:  1.  Bicuspid aortic valve with moderate severe aortic regurgitation; 2.  Moderate dilation of aortic root and ascending aorta; 3.  Severely dilated left ventricular cavity size with normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function; 4.  Left ventricular ejection fraction normal at 66%; 5.  Normal right ventricular cavity size and function; 6.  Moderately dilated main pulmonary artery; 7.  Bilateral enlargement.  This study was ordered by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 121**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  The patient was referred for a cardiac catheterization to determine the central need for surgery.  On [**2703-12-22**], the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization.  The cardiac catheterization revealed normal coronary arteries; severe aortic regurgitation with aortic root dilation; mild aortic stenosis; preserved systolic ventricular function.  Following the cardiac catheterization the patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for aortic valve replacement. 
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 1598**] is an 80 year old female with a past medical history significant for diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  She states that she was in her usual state of health until [**Holiday **], [**2666**], at which time she began experiencing substernal chest pressure, which radiated to the neck and throat, as well as shortness of breath multiple times per day.  These episodes were relieved by rest. She presented to the Emergency Department at the [**Hospital6 3817**] on [**2667-12-13**], complaining of 8 out of 10 chest pain and persistent shortness of breath.  The Cardiology Service was called to evaluate her and she was started on a Nitroglycerin drip.  An electrocardiogram done at the time showed ST depressions in the anterolateral leads and she was found to have a CKMB of 25.6 and a troponin of 3.28.  She was known to have critical aortic stenosis by echocardiogram in [**2667-10-4**]. She was admitted to the outside hospital, started on Lopressor, intravenous Heparin and intravenous Integrelin and aggressive diuresis was started with intravenous Lasix.  Her chest pain and dyspnea resolved and she was stabilized on the aforementioned medical regimen.  She subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization, on [**2667-12-18**], which revealed critical aortic stenosis; 70, 80 and 90 percent stenosis of a dominant right coronary artery and 60 to 70 percent stenosis of the proximal circumflex and 50 percent stenosis of the proximal mid left anterior descending artery. The decision was made to transfer her to the [**Hospital6 1739**] for coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement. She denies having any chest pain, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, dizziness or lightheadedness on arrival to the [**Hospital6 253**].  She denies any prior history of transient ischemic attacks or cerebrovascular accidents as well as any history of peripheral vascular disease. 
Patient is an 82 year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, type 2 diabetes and hypothyroidism found down by her sister on the day of admission.  The patient was last seen two days prior to admission.  The patient was found in bed in the right recumbent position with a large amount of dry blood on the bed and with evidence of laceration on the right side of her tongue.  Her [**Location (un) 2571**] score was 4.  She was unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli with spontaneous eye opening.  The patient's airway was patent at this time. Her respiratory rate was 22 with an O2 saturation of 100 percent.  Blood pressure was 130/80, pulse 90, fingerstick 159. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 90.  The patient was brought into the Emergency Room and given her unresponsiveness and lack of gag reflex on examination she was intubated for airway protection and a nasogastric tube was placed.  Her arterial blood gases at this time showed pH 6.4, bicarbonate 34 and pO2 of 357.  Her lactate was 3.1. She was subsequently put on a ventilator.  An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 91, LAD normal intervals at 2 and 3 but no ischemic changes. Chest x-ray was done which showed no infiltrates. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7976**] is a 58 y/o M with a history of CAD s/p PCI ([**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] patient) who presents via the ED with one week of abdominal pain now progressing and with altered mental status. He reports ~6 days ago (Monday) he began with epigastric/chest pain that was attributed to heartburn that improved overnight but with transition more to right lower quadrant abdominal pain, severe in nature, with nausea. Fever/temperature curve unknown. In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], he was febrile to 104 rectally, HR 80s to 100s and maintained normotension. CT scan was obtained which showed an appendicolith as well as inflammatory changes in the small bowel and cecum that were noted to be larger in magnitude than otherwise suggested by appendicitis. Surgery was consulted, and he was managed with antibiotics overnight (vancomycin, zosyn, flagyl, ceftriaxone). He was admitted initally to the ICU and then transferred to the surgical service for further management. 
53 yo M with history of HTN, Hyperlipidemia, bicuspid aortic valve and aortic insufficiency with worsening shortness of breath. Pt states that he was diagnosed in [**3449**] with aortic insufficiency and bicuspid valve, but has not had any repeat echocardiograms since that time. The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for complaints of worsening shortness of breath and echo showed severe AS with [**Location (un) 108**] 0.4cm2 and 4+AI. Pt presents today for elective preop cardiac catheterization and surgical consult for AVR.

This is a 55-year-old gentleman who suffered from a motor vehicle accident approximately one year ago which resulted in a right hip fracture.  He had been previously operated on, but still complains of significant right hip pain, therefore he is taken back to the Operating Room for a right hip fusion and fixation.  This is operation #4. 
This 55-year-old gentleman with right hip pain dating back to a motor vehicle collision sustained one year prior to admission, was admitted to [**Hospital1 1426**] on [**3007-2-25**] for revision of his right hip fusion and fixation.  This reoperation was required secondary to a fracture at the site of his old hip fusion and fixation. HOSPITAL COURSE:  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4244**] [**Name (STitle) 280**] on [**3007-2-25**].  The procedure was performed without complications with an estimated blood loss that was significant for being five liters.  Intraoperatively the patient received 16 liters of intravenous fluids, 11 units of packed red blood cells, four units of fresh frozen plasma and the patient was productive of 2.2 liters of fluid intraoperative.  After the surgery and in light of the patient's considerable blood loss the patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit where the patient was intubated and sedated.  His postoperative laboratory studies were significant for an hematocrit of 26.8 which was down from 49.8 preoperatively.  His initial blood gas was 7.3/40/170/28/-5 and his coagulation factors were a PT 15.1, PTT of 36.2 and an INR of 1.5. In terms of his neurological examination the patient remained sedated.  As far as his cardiovascular status, the patient continued to be vigorously fluid resuscitated.  In light of the patient's reoperation, the patient was maintained on log roll precautions. On postoperative day one the patient continued to be intubated and sedated for comfort.  He continued to be transfused and he received two additional units of packed red blood cells in the surgical intensive care unit.  His hematocrit on postoperative day one was 30.1.  His wound at the time was clean, dry and intact and there was no sign of large right thigh hematoma. On postoperative day two the patient's hematocrit was 29.4 and the patient was extubated and his pain was well managed on Percocet and Benadryl.  He was transferred to the floor in stable condition with activity instructions of log roll precautions and bedrest.  Lovenox was started for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. On postoperative day four the patient was in stable condition on the floor.  His right lower extremity was bandaged with minimal drainage and his right lower extremity was generally warm, well perfused and neurovascularly intact.  On postoperative day five the patient was started on touch-down weight bearing for the right lower extremity and a physical therapy consultation was obtained to assist the patient out of bed and to begin instructions for this patient regarding resumption of his prior functional status. On postoperative day seven the patient was assessed to be stable for discharge and in light of the patient's progress with physical therapy, disposition planning was initiated. Occupational therapy was also consulted and their recommendation was that the patient be transferred to inpatient rehabilitation where he could obtain further teaching on compensatory strategies for self care in light of his functional limitations. On [**3007-3-4**] the patient was noted to have a large hematoma at the site of his former surgery and on [**3007-3-5**] the patient was taken back to the operating room for evacuation and washout of his large hematoma.  This procedure was performed with an estimated blood loss of 100 cc and a Hemovac drain was placed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the floor in stable condition. Once on the floor the patient continued to do well and was afebrile.  On [**3007-3-8**] a repeat physical therapy consultation was obtained in light of the patient's reoperation, and again physical therapy recommended that this patient be transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation facility for further instruction and teaching regarding his functional limitations.  Such a transfer was obtained on [**3007-3-10**] and the patient was transferred in stable condition to an appropriate rehabilitation center.

This is a 41 year-old woman with a five year history of pancreatitis followed by insulin dependent diabetes who presented to [**Hospital1 188**] in the Emergency Department on the 26th complaining of two days of fever with nausea and vomiting. The patient notes that she failed to use her insulin during this period.  She also notes she had decrease intake and diarrhea and had also been noncompliant in her po intake. She had been eating a lot of bananas and apples during this period.  During this period she states she had abdominal pain after eating, which is consistent with her prior attacks of pancreatitis.  Though she denied any chest pain.  She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit in diabetic ketoacidosis. In the Intensive Care Unit she was put on an insulin drip with her anion gap being closed she was then transferred to the general medicine floor. 
43 y/o AAF with a PMH of hereditary pancreatitis, DKA, HTN, and peptic ulcer disease, presents as a transfer from the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for GI bleed/pancreatitis/DKA. The patient initially had generalized myalgias with URI symptoms along with decreased PO intake about 4 days prior to admission. Three days ago, the patient began having repeated episodes of vomiting revealing bilious fluid over several hours.  However, after continued retching, she began to have coffee ground emesis associated with severe epigastric pain radiating to her back and subsequent melena, but no BRBPR  The patient had continued episodes of this hematemesis overnight on [**3482-12-19**], and then decided to go to the ER.  There, she was lavaged, fluid bolused, and a CT scan with oral contrast (no IV contrast due to creatinine of 3).  She then got a CT scan which showed no free air, no free fluid, no evidence of pseudocyst, and the pancreas unremarkable.  She was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] due to her DKA with a initial sugar in the 400s with associated metabolic acidosis and intermittent hypotension ( in the 70s/30s).  In the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**], she was aggressively hydrated with normal saline at 200cc/hr, given an insulin drip at 1 unit/hr, made NPO, given pain control for her presumed pancreatitis, and her crit serially monitored.  At 11/8, at 2am, her insulin drip was discontinued and she was controlled with RISS, and her hypotension improved to the 110s/80s on IVF (her intake was 9 liters over 24 hours and her output was 25-40 cc/hr)  She was then trensferred to the floors once she was hemodynamically stable, her crit stabilized, and there were no signs of active GI bleed. 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 47 yo female with IDDM and chronic pancreatitis who presents with worsening right upper quadrant abdominal pain for the past 2 days.  She describes the abdominal pain as "throbbing."  It radiates from her RUQ to her back.  She states that her pain is consistent with previous exacerbations of chronic pancreatitis.  She has had two episodes of non-bloody, non-bilious emesis for each of the past two days.   She states that she also developed a fluid collection on her left lower extremity approximately one week ago.  She states that it started as a boil, then opened and started draining pus.  She denies any injury to her leg, insect bites, or precipitating factor for this.   She states that she has not taken her insulin since Thursday since she has not been feeling well. . She has had subjective fevers at home.  She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, dysuria, diarrhea.  She endorses a frontal headache for the past several days, but on arrival to the MICU states that it has resolved.  She denies any dizziness, loss of balance, falls, or blurred vision.   She denies any recurrence of the perirectal abscess from previous hospitalization and she denies any active genital lesions. . On arrival to the ED, T 98.1, HR 78, BP 103/66, RR 16, SpO2 99% on RA.  Her glucose was 633 and anion gap was 33.  Patient received 50 units IV regular insulin over 30 minutes by accident (incident report filed).  She became lethargic and ABG was performed 7.15/33/55. She subsequently was started on D5NS with 40 meq KCl @ 200 cc/hour.  Her repeat fingersticks one hour after insulin was 361, 341, 350, 329.  She recieved a total of 3 liters NS.  A CXR, RUQ ultrasound, and plain films of the left lower extremity were performed.  Foot abscess was cultured, and patient received Vancomycin 1 gram.  Prior to transfer, insulin gtt at 7 units/hour was started. 
51 year old female with history of stage V CKD, t2DM c/b by neuropathy/nephropathy/retinopathy, HTN, and chronic pancreatitis, presenting with RUQ pain and decreased PO intake x 1 week.  For 1 week prior to admission, she recalls feeling very fatigued and had some mild shortness of breath as well.  Her urine was also very dark and she describes it as "bloody", though she points at a more [**Location (un) 2418**]-like color.  Her poor intake started 3-4 days prior to admission, with vomiting starting 1 day ago.  It started as normal vomitous and then became darker. After vomiting numerous time, she was spitting blood.  She first described the vomitous as coffee grounds, but reports that it was actually a green tinge.. She reports that she has been urinating, last void just before coming to the ED.   She called EMS today because her fatigue was getting worse and her abdominal pain (different than her normal pancreatitis pain) was becoming more intense. She tried to avoid seeing a doctor because she thought she would just get better.  She did have episodes of feeling dizzy.  Per EMS, her systolic BPs were running in the 80s-90s en route. On her last Nephrology clinic visit, her progression of her CKD was felt to be secondary to significant diabetic involvement of her kidney.  She was also noted to have nephrotic range proteinuria and increased blood pressure.  They discussed the possible need of renal replacement therapy in the future with possibilities of kidney transplant or dialysis.  They referred here to the Transplant Clinic to get the workup started. In the ED, initial vitals were: 75 103/67 (after 1L IVF) 14 99% RA. Exam was guaiac negative from below with a hematocrit well above her baseline of 30-33. No pericardial rub on exam. Abdominal pain much improved after 5mg of morphine.  Other labs are notable for acute on chronic renal failure with BUN/creat 126/9.1. Na 129, K 4.1, HCO3 9 (AG of 28) and WBC 17.5 with left shift. CXR was unremarkable and CT abdomen showed cholelithiasis in a distended GB but no apparent wall edema, pericholecystic fluid, or surrounding inflammation to suggest cholecystitis. She received 2L IVF and was covered with Cipro/Flagyl.  Renal was [**Location (un) 4161**] and recommended giving D5W with 150 mEq NaHCO3 and sending off urinalysis and urine electrolytes. On arrival to the MICU, she is in some abdominal pain but conversant and with stable vital signs (normal BP). 
The patient has had a heart murmur since childhood and found to have a bicuspid aortic valve on echocardiogram, and recently had an increase in the size of the ascending aorta.  Otherwise, the patient denies any other medical problems.  [**Name (NI) **] did have surgery in [**2600**] for an undescended testicle. SOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies a smoking history.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  So, on [**2614-5-16**], the patient underwent homograft aortic root replacement, resection, and grafting proximal aortic arch.  He underwent general anesthesia.  There were no intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery room on a nitroglycerin drip in normal sinus rhythm.  He was transferred from the recovery room to the Intensive Care Unit, and on postoperative day one was transferred to the floor, where he continued with an uncomplicated postoperative course. The patient did experience some tachycardia with a heart rate of around 117.  For this tachycardia the patient's beta blockers were increased, and he did respond.  His beta blockers were increased to 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.   Potassium was repleted.  The patient was diuresing about 4 liters per day. The patient had very good pain control.  He was ambulating around the halls without difficulty on his own. CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable. DISCHARGE STATUS: Discharged to home with prescription.  No services needed.

MRI of the spine with contrast done on [**4-15**] showed heterogeneously enhancing tumor at the C-4 to C-6 level likely extrinsic, question of schwannoma versus meningioma. On [**3180-4-15**] the patient's neurologic status deteriorated and the patient became weaker on the left side in all muscle groups.  The patient was operated on [**3180-4-16**].  She underwent C-4 to C-7 bilateral laminectomy for resection of tumor. There were no intraoperative complications. Postoperatively the patient was monitored in the surgical intensive care unit.  She was extubated on post-op day one. Her motor strength was 2 in the biceps, triceps and deltoids on the left and 5- on the right.  Grasp was 4- on the left. IP was 4- on the left.  The right side was [**3-29**].  Incision was clean, although the patient did have some serous fluid leaking from the superior aspect of the incision which was stitched with no further leakage.  The patient was transferred to the regular floor on post-op day one. She was seen by physical therapy and occupational therapy and was found to require a short rehab stay prior to discharge home.  Incision remained clean and dry. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.day. 3.  Percocet one to two tabs p.o. q.four hours p.r.n. 4.

Pt is a 77 yo F with DMII, HTN, dementia, and paranoid schizophrenia who presented from an OSH after a witnessed cardiac arrest at her nursing home. Patient lives at [**Location 576**] x1 year. Per report, she was sitting in a chair before dinner when she was noted to become blue, slumped down into her chair, and became unresponsive. No report of chest pain or shortness of breath. She was carried back to her room, and approximately 3 minutes elapsed before CPR was started. She was coded for 15 minutes, and reportedly had an AED placed with 1 shock prior to EMT arrival. A perfusing rhythm was obtained, and she was intubated in the field and taken to [**Hospital6 **]. . At OSH, pt's VS were 106/65 HR 100. EKG with ST depressions in V2-V6 with no prior for comparison. She reportedly had another VF arrest 20 minutes later, and was shocked at 200 J back in sinus tachycardia. She received 300 mg IV amiodarone x1. She then received ASA 325 mg PO x1, Plavix 600 mg PO x1, heparin gtt with bolus, integrillin gtt with bolus, and benadryl 25 mg IV x1. She underwent a cardiac catherization that showed a 90% left main stenosis, 60% proximal left circumflex, 80% RCA, 90% lesion followed by a long complex cork screw like 70% lesion in the proximal RCA. Mid to distal RCA has a haze 95-99% lesion. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of CABG. . In the CCU, patient is unable to answer ROS due to intubation and sedation. She was noted to have bleeding from groin site. Angiosheath was removed and pressure held with good effect. NG tube was noted to be draining ~250 ccs of dark, frothy, coffee-ground blood. Gastric lavage was + after 750 ccs of irrigation. Also noted to have upward deviated gaze and seizure-like activity (first shaking of the upper extremities, and then lower extremities, then tongue fasciculations). Neurology urgently consulted, recommended IV dilantin load and IV ativan (received 6 mg IV total) with good control of seizure activity. A-line, R IJ placed, and patient sent for non-contrast CT and CTA to assess for acute ICH prior to initiating Arctic Sun protocol. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10922**] is a 43 year old man with h/o CKD (unknown baseline Cr), who was admitted with epidural abscess. The patient had a 1 week h/o back pain ([**4-21**]) on the left side that radiated down to his left ankle. He presented to the [**Hospital1 872**] ED at that time and was discharged on Ibuprofen and Flexeril, with a likely diagnosis of sciatica. He then presented to [**Hospital 1456**] Hospital 2 days later and was again discharged with pain medications. The pain worsened during the week to the point where the patient was having difficulty with ambulation and getting out of bed. The patient was seen by his PCP the day prior to admission and had an MRI, which was indeterminate [**1-7**] to artifact. The PCP urged the patient to come to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. The patient took 3 Tramadol and 4 Percocet this AM prior to presentation. The wife noted that he was more lethargic and was incoherent at times over the past day. In the ED, initial vs were: T 96.9 P 87 BP 84/38 RR 10 O2 95%. He was found to have LLE weakness and decreased rectal tone on exam. He was hypotensive to the 80s and received 3LNS. Labs were notable for Cr 6.0 (unknown baseline). Pt received Ativan prior to MRI, which showed e/o epidural abscess. Patient was given Ceftriaxone, Vanc, and Zosyn, has not received Flagyl yet at this time. He was evaluated by neurosurgery, who was unable to take the patient straight to the OR given his renal failure. On the floor, the patient was lethargic, but arousable and answering appropriately. He has pain in his right shoulder with movement and some pain in his left lower back. He notes that he has not had any urine output all day. No fevers or chills at home, but the pt does endorse having sweats. Wife and daughter with colds at home, but developed them after the patient's back pain had already started. No recent travel or h/o IVDU. Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

The patient is a 58-year-old gentleman, who was status post a fall from [**3436-2-15**], who sustained severe subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intracranial hemorrhage, managed conservatively, who was recovered and transferred to rehab, presented today for a follow-up head CT by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from [**Hospital3 **] after the patient had a seizure.  The patient found to have increasing size of subdural hematoma, 2 cm in depth along the left side with midline shift.  The patient was sent directly to the Emergency Room and admitted to the neurosurgical service. EXAM:  The patient's heart rate is 72, BP 130/40, respiratory rate 24.  In general, an obese gentleman in no acute distress.  CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.  CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, rub or gallop.  ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender.  The patient has a PEG.  EXTREMITIES:  Left leg is status post a left ankle fracture.  MENTAL STATUS: Awake, alert, globally aphasic, does not speak or follow commands, appears with a right neglect.  CRANIAL NERVES:  Has a right facial droop, EOMs are full, pupils are 2 down to 1 mm bilaterally.  He has positive corneals.  Positive gag. MOTOR STRENGTH:  He does have a right footdrop with a brace. He also has a fracture of his left ankle.  He is in a bivalved cast.  He moves the left side more vigorously than the right.  Can hold his left arm up to gravity.  Right arm flops down immediately when lifted up.  Bends both legs, hips and knees to noxious stimulation.  His reflexes are 3 plus on the right side in the upper extremities, trace on the left side in the upper extremities.  His patella is a 3 plus.  He does have clonus on the right side, and his lower extremity reflexes were not tested secondary to the cast on the left leg.  Coordination and gait were not tested. STUDIES:  Head CT shows a left convexity subdural hematoma with subfalcine herniation. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the ICU and had bedside drainage of a subdural hematoma.  He had a repeat head CT day 1 post drainage which showed good evacuation of subdural hematoma.  The patient's drain was left in place. The patient showed no evidence of infection.  His vital signs were stable, and he was afebrile.  His mental status was improving.  He was awake, alert and oriented, following commands. He was transferred to the Stepdown Unit on [**3436-3-16**].  He was oriented to self, following commands x 4.  His drain put out 14 cc over the last 8 hours.  He was improving.  The drain was DC'd on [**3436-3-16**] in the evening, after head CT showed good evacuation of the subdural. The patient was seen by physical therapy and occupational therapy and found to require a short rehab stay.  He was also evaluated by orthopedics for his left ankle fracture, who felt the patient should just remain in his bivalved cast.  He is only partial weightbearing on that.  The patient's neurologic status remained stable, although he did have periods of agitation.  He was overall improving. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Lansoprazole 30 mg po once daily. 2.

Brought in by ambulance after being found naked with bottles of alcohol around him.   Per patient, started drinking Monday morning, vodka and orangeaid, and just kept drinking.  Drinks nearly daily for no clear reason.  Was feeling well prior to drinking, no symptoms or complaints.  Has a history of seizures and DTs per patient, last about a year ago.  Was found by his friend yesterday who called the ambulance and brought him in. . In ED vitals were 97.4, 80, 146/84, 20, 100% NRB. FS 172, ETOH 456  Was relating right lower abdominal pain radiating to right hip as well as chest pain and SOB but no respiratory distress noted on assessment.  Had a shaky episode - unclear if was seizure - as well as episodes of unresponsiveness and 'foaming' at the mouth' and was treated with valium 5mg IM x 3, ativan 2mg IM x 1, valium 10mg IV x 1, ativan 2mg IV x 1. Multiple attempts at peripheral and central access failed (attending attempt at REJ, B IJ, RSC, R groin).  Head CT showed small area of hemorrhage over [**12-19**] gyri on the right infereior frontal lobe which was read as either artifact or possible extra-axial hemorrhage and neurosurgery was consulted who recommended repeat head CT in 24 hrs or with any clinical decline.  No surgical intervention at this time. . Currently is nauseated, has double vision, is seeing bugs crawling all over the ceiling. States he had seizures yesterday, although he says he does not remember the episodes and only knows he had seizures because someone told him about them. Also has right hip pain.  Per patient, fractured hip in the mid [**3298**] after being hit by a truck but was doing well until one month ago when he fell and hit right hip against the coffee table and the pain has now been increasing.  No fevers, chills, HA, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, dysuria, or other symptoms. 
The patient is a 62 year old man with a history of hypertension, seizure disorder, and EtOH abuse with history of withdrawl seizures, who presented with an EtOH withdrawal seizure and subsequently developed left gaze deviation and right sided weakness, called as CODE STROKE. The patient was admitted on [**3337-12-16**] after being found on his porch with an unwitnessed seizure with bowel and bladder incontinence. In the ED, vitals were T 97.9 P 96 BP 180/90 R 32 O2 sat 97% on 2L. He was intoxicated with EtOH level 211. He was given ativan 2 mg IV x2 and 30-40 of diazepam IV. Head CT on admission showed no hemorrhage. 
This is an 86 year old female with a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and a history of syncope who was admitted on [**2777-5-24**] with slurred speech, right hand difficulty grasping, and mental confusion for the past two days.  The slurred speech and hand difficulty grasping were of about 15 minutes duration and then improved.  The patient was taken to the Emergency Room for further evaluation, in the Emergency Room she was noted to have a heart rate of 30 during micturition and then subsequently had a loss of consciousness with spontaneous resolution.  The patient had recurrent episodes of bradycardia which prompted intubation for airway protection.  The patient was treated for hypertensive urgency with systolic blood pressures in the 200s and responded to therapy.  The patient prior to intubation had no complaints and was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management. 
This is a 66 year old female with a history of Stage 2 breast cancer, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia where family found her on the day of admission unresponsive.  Per the Triage, she did not complain of any chest pain, shortness of breath, fever or chills.  Per family a few days ago, she was feeling weak, slurred speech but had not been eating.  She was back to herself the day before admission until, on the day of admission, she had mental status changes per her grandson upon arrival to the Emergency Department.  Denies any nausea or vomiting.  In the Emergency Room, she had abdominal pain, cool extremities, hypotensive in the 70s over 30s systolic and diastolic, started on Levophed but weaned after intravenous fluid hydration which improved her blood pressure.  She was intubated for a questionable concern of tiring with arterial blood gas of 7.09, 18, and 400 O2.  Post intubation, she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further treatment. 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] comes in with recurrent breast cancer on the left side.  In fact she was felt to have a new primary.  She was found to be gene positive. She had breast cancer on the left side treated by lumpectomy, radiation and now has a new tumor. She is opting for bilateral mastectomy. At the same time she is having bilateral oophorectomy. She had an abnormality found on her appendix. She is going to have an appendectomy at the same time.  After careful consultation she is opting for immediate reconstruction with free TRAM flap. She does smoke and this is why I suggested the microsurgical approach to her rather than a standard pedicle TRAM. She also understands this does add more damage to her abdominal wall.  She understands she will have a large abdominal scar, potential for hernia formation, abdominal wall weakness, need for revisional surgery one or both flaps could fail, fat necrosis a possibility. No guarantees could be made. 
Dr. [**Known patient lastname **] as a 60-year-old pediatrician who presented to the [**Hospital1 188**] emergency room with bloody bowel movements and lightheadedness.  He underwent a colonoscopy that showed extensive blood throughout the entire colon, and intubation of the terminal ileum showed blood coming from above.  An upper endoscopy of the stomach and duodenum was unremarkable. He was deemed to have a bleeding site within the small bowel. The bleeding was fairly brisk and required multiple units of packed red blood cell transfusions. He underwent a GI bleeding study on the night of his admission that showed immediate tracer activity within the left upper quadrant and over the next 90 minutes, the activity proceeded toward the right lower quadrant suggestive of a bleeding source in the proximal small bowel, perhaps near the ligament of Treitz. He then underwent a mesenteric arteriogram which showed no extravasation of contrast. However, a blush was seen in the left upper quadrant within the proximal jejunum, suspicious for possible stromal neoplasm at that site. This was communicated to the medical ICU team and they obtained a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on [**7-26**].  This showed a 3.5 x 2 x 2.1 cm enhancing soft tissue mass in the left upper quadrant likely arising from the proximal jejunum.  There was no definite evidence of metastatic disease, only 2 simple cysts within the liver.  I advised a diagnostic laparoscopy and a laparoscopic-assisted small bowel resection and Dr. [**Known patient lastname **] consented to proceed. 
This is a 65 year-old female, Cantonese speaking, with chronic hepatitis B virus cirrhosis with the history of hepatoma x2, status post radiofrequency ablation x2. Patient denied any fever, night sweats. She did admit to a recent cough approximately 10 days ago treated with antibiotics by the primary care physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was unable to state which antibiotics. She complaints of chronic nasal stuffiness, uses Sudafed for this. She denied any sore throat. Denied headache, malaise, fatigue. She did admit to a cough and a small amount of yellow phlegm noted in the morning since the treatment with antibiotics. She denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, shortness of breath, chest pain. She complains of nervousness. 
50 yo female with hx of gastric bypass ([**3007**]), spinal fusion, anxiety, GERD, presents in transfer from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital for concern of possible hepatic abscess. 3 days ago, pt began to develop abdominal discomfort, for which she took Gas-x, as she has a hx of gas pains s/p gastric bypass, although the nature of the pain seemed different.  Pain was located in RUQ and radiated around R side to R back.  Pain progressively worsened to [**10-20**], and began to develop fevers which started off mild, but progressed to 104+.  She was noted to have mild elevation of LFT's with AST to 103, ALT 106, alk phos 75.  Bili 0.8.  WBC on [**1-22**] showed WBC 7.7 and bandemia 40%.  Pt was treated with IV Unasyn, and Ertapenem was later added last night.  Pt feels that she has continued to clinically worsen with increased pain, fevers, rigors, worst at night. . She had multiple imaging studies, which revealed 4.4 cm mass in lateral segment of of L lobe of the liver, and a 2.7 cm lesion in medial segment of L lobe of liver.  MRCP was performed to further evaluate, however the report is currently pending (awaiting fax). Pt had blood cultures drawn, and micro showed e.coli, with some resistances. Pt was subsequently transferred for furhter evaluation and treatment with concern of possible liver abscess and/or cholangitis. . . ROS: +: as per HPI, plus: fevers, chills, rigors, night sweats, nausea, vomiting (x1), abdominal distention (subjective), constipation. . Denies: 10 point ROS otherwise negative. 
The patient is a 55 year-old man with a history with myxomatous mitral valve and moderate to severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] syndrome presented with two weeks of high-grade fevers from 103.0 to as high as 105.0.  He had these on a daily basis multiple times a day.  The patient was able to control his fever during the daytime with multiple doses of acetaminophen (1 g q6h) however otherwise at night he said that when he woke up in the morning he soaked the bed with sweat.  Otherwise, the patient did not have any localizing symptoms except for mild dyspnea and cough. He also reported a mild neck pain which he stated was from laying in bed for so long.  He did not have neck stiffness, photophobia, headache or other neurological symptoms.  The patient did not have any chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or urinary changes.  He last had dental work in [**2912-1-17**] and took amoxicillin at that time.  He had otherwise not taken antibiotics or been hospitalized recently.  He had not traveled out of the country in more than ten years or left the [**Location (un) 86**] area in several months. . In the ED, initial VS were: T 103.8, HR 110, BP 152/76, RR 20, Sat 93% RA.  Before starting fluids, his O2 saturation dropped to the mid 80s on 2L. CXR showed a right middle lobe pneumonia. Blood cultres were drawn before starting gentamicin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin to cover for ICU community-acquired pneumonia and also for endocarditis. 
The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity, who presented with the sudden onset of difficulty speaking. She had been known to be speaking normally at approximately 6:05 p.m. on the day of admission.  At 6:30 p.m., she was seen by her family and was noted to have difficulty speaking. The sounds that were coming out did not sound like actual words.  It was unclear if she understood what was being said to her.  There may have been some right-sided facial weakness. She was brought to the [**Hospital6 253**] Emergency Department.  In the Emergency Department, she was noted by the Neurology resident and Stroke fellow to have Wernicke's type aphasia.  Head CT was negative for bleed. Blood sugar on arrival was 468, and this improved to 288 after Insulin.  Blood pressure was as high as the 200s, and this improved with Labetalol. Given the fact that she had multiple vascular risk factors and presented within the thrombolytic window, she was given intravenous TPA. She was then admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for monitoring, status post TPA. 
fever, chills, cough . HPI: Mrs [**Known patient lastname 725**] is at 64 yo female with pmh of DM, htn, s/p CVA, OSA, and asthma who was admitted to the MICU due to somulence and concern for sepsis. The week prior to admission she developed a sore throat and productive cough which caused her to use her albuterl inhaler more frequently. Then the day prior to admission she developed fever (to 103.4 at home), chills, and urinary symptoms (dysuria, incontinence and frequency). She did report several family members with viral illnesses. . In the ED she was febrile to 102.9 and tachycardic with HR in the 120's to 130's. She required 4 L of oxygen to maintain her sats in the mid 90's. She was cultured and started on levofloxacin and vancomycin for PNA, although her CXR showed no infiltrate. She was also given IVF. She remained tachycardic and was noted to become somulent (although her ABG showed 7.41/46/81 on 4L) so she was admitted to the MICU. . Vanc was continued in the MICU and levofloxacin was changed to zosyn due to concern for sepsis. She was also started on oseltamivir due to concern for flu. In the MICU a DFA was sent and was negative for flu. Swine flu confirmatory testing is pending at the state lab. Urinary leginella also returned negative. Patient also has a history of chronic skin ulcers on her chest, leg, and vulva. These were considered as a possible source of infection so her antibiotics have been continued. During her MICU stay her tachycardia resolved and she was weaned off oxygen, currently sattnig normally on RA. . Currently she denies pain or SOB at rest, but admits to SOB with exertion. Had been constipated until today when she developed diarrhea. Denies abdominal pain. She has been afebrile since admission to the MICU. . ROS: Denies night sweats, headache, vision changes, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, hematuria. . 
52 yo F h/o extensive LLE DVT s/p thrombectomy and IVC filter placement on coumadin/plavix, profound iron deficiency anemia [**2-24**] AV malformations, DM II, HTN, morbid obesity who p/w lightheadedness, lethargy, found to have Hct drop from 22 to 18 and dark stools. . Of note, pt has just been admitted from [**5-7**] to [**5-10**] with reproducible CP felt to be due to costochondritis after extensive workup (EKG unremarkable, ROMI, CTA without PE). Pt was treated with tylenol, lidoderm patch, and capsaicin cream, in addition to the oxycodone which she takes chronically at home (she is allergic to aspirin, so NSAIDs were not given). A pharmacologic MIBI was done as well and showed a possible mild reversible inferior wall defect. Cardiology was consulted, and recommended medical management at this time, given that there would not be a mortality benefit to cardiac cath with the findings on her stress MIBI and that this would be for symptom management only.  The patient has an aspirin allergy, and was already on plavix, BB, ACEI and pravastatin which was increased to the maximum dose. She was started on ISMN 30 mg daily which she had not yet filled. . 1d PTA, pt noted formed dark stool x1.

This is a 58-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism and reactive airway disease admitted for decreased oxygen saturations and decreased blood pressures secondary to pneumonia. She reports not feeling well for the last two weeks prior to admission; initially with flu-like symptoms included rhinorrhea and a cough.  She also had fevers up to 102.8 degrees.  Over the week prior to admission.  She has been feeling increasingly weak and decreased oral intake.  She also has had a cough occasionally productive; however, no hemoptysis.  Occasional night sweats.  She denies any chest pain.  She does not really complain of shortness of breath but has been in bed most of the time. She came to the Emergency Department because of weakness and was found to have an oxygen saturation down to the 70s, which responded to supplemental oxygen and nebulizers.  A chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe consolidation.  Her blood pressure was decreased down to the 70s/40s.  She received a fluid bolus of 500 mL which increased her blood pressure up to the mid 90s.  She received levofloxacin, albuterol nebulizers, and Solu-Medrol.

Patient is a 41 yo female with PMH notable for constipation. She originally presented with a few hours of bright red blood per rectum associated with lightheadedness. The patient was in her usual state of health until the morning of admission when she awoke feeling the urge to defecate(unusual for her). She had a large bloody filled BM (approximately 1 cup), and immediately went several more times, needing to flush the toilet 8 times given the volume of blood. She felt lightheaded, dizzy, and SOB after the incident.  She denies chest pain or abdominal pain. She continued to have BRBPR 7 times throughout the day. She called EMS, and due to her low BPs in the field (initially 64/44 with HR 82 per EMS notes), she was taken to an OSH ER and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Upon admission to the ED, VS= 80-90s 129/70 sats 100% on 2L 02. She continued to have bloody bowel movements in the ED. NGT lavage returned bile. The pt was begun on IV PPI. EKG was unremarkable.

She was transferred to the floor once her hematocrit stabilized. She states that she has felt well prior to these episodes. She denies diarrhea-- although the bloody Bms were "loose"-- and has not had fevers, fatigue, malaise, weight loss or any other symptoms. 
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with no prior intubation or BiPAP in the past, also chronic atrial fibrillation.  The patient was in his usual state of health until two days prior to admission when the wife returned home from [**Location (un) **] and found the patient to have an upper respiratory tract infection and a cough.  The patient has become progressively more tachypneic over the last few days.  Also the patient has been producing white sputum.  The patient has not complained of any fevers, chills or chest pain. On the day of admission in the Emergency Department the patient's temperature was 100.2, heart rate 128, respiratory rate 40, blood pressure 146/86.  He was saturating 98% on six liters of oxygen nasal cannula.  The assessment in the Emergency Department was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  The patient was given Solu-Medrol, levofloxacin, and also albuterol nebulizers and fluids.  A chest x-ray in the emergency room showed evidence of pneumonia.  There was no evidence of ischemia on ECG.  The patient remained tachypneic in the Emergency Department, also using his accessory muscles for respiration.  A blood gas was done and was found to be 7.20, 67 and 93.  The patient was started on BiPAP and improved somewhat.  The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit for further management. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was found to be somewhat hypertensive, tachypneic and saturating 98% on five liters of oxygen nasal cannula.  His heart rate was 120.  He was uncomfortable using accessory muscles for respiration.  He had dry mucous membranes.  He had diffuse wheezing bilaterally in his chest.  His heart rate was irregular and tachycardic.  His abdomen was benign.  His extremities were significant only for some trace edema.  He had no rashes and his skin was warm and dry. LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 130, potassium 5.1, creatinine 1.7, and chest x-ray that showed hyperinflated lungs.  There was no evidence of infiltrates or congestive heart failure. HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the medical intensive care unit the patient was continued on BiPAP and levofloxacin.  On hospital day one the patient began to experience symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, notably delusions and hallucinations and was started on standing Ativan.  He was also noted to have coffee ground substance coming from his OG tube.  His hematocrit had been stable at 34.  The patient was started on an Ativan drip and fentanyl for alcohol withdrawal on hospital day two. Also the patient defervesced his fever on hospital day two. His creatinine remained stable at 1.5, slightly up from his baseline at 1.1.  The patient was extubated on hospital day three and initially did well.  A short while later, a blood gas was taken and was found to be 7.21 for pH, PCO2 of 79 and a PO2 of 118.  He was placed back on the vent at that time and tube feedings were begun.  The patient was again extubated on hospital day six.  Blood gas at that time showed a pH of 7.18, PCO2 of 103, and a PO2 of 231.  This was on noninvasive pressure support.  A short while later the values did improve to 7.23, 86, and 93.  On hospital day seven the patient was switched to mask ventilation.  His PCO2 remained in the 60s.  The patient then was transferred to nasal cannula, six liters, and was saturating in the low 90s, progressively improved, and ultimately was transferred to the floor on hospital day eight on two liters of oxygen, saturating in the low 90s.  He has remained afebrile since hospital day one.  On hospital day nine the levofloxacin was discontinued.  He remained afebrile.  Initially he was tachycardic on the floor with heart rates in the 120s that eventually resolved as his beta blocker was increased to 75 mg t.i.d. of metoprolol.  The patient remained stable on the floor requiring only two liters of oxygen and maintaining oxygen saturations in the mid 90s.  He also received nebulizer treatments p.r.n. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Thiamine 100 mg p.o. q.d. 2. Folic acid 100 mg p.o. q.d. 3. Nicotine patch 7 mg t.d. q.d. 4. Bisacodyl 10 mg p.r. q.d. 5. Albuterol nebulizer, 1 nebulizer q. 2 hours p.r.n. 
The patient is a 73-year-old gentleman with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presents with progressive shortness of breath times two days which was associated with a cough productive of white sputum. The patient denies any chest pain, fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting.  He denies orthopnea or increased lower extremity edema.  There is a questioned episode of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea approximately three days prior to admission. Of note, the patient's wife returned from Europe approximately ten days ago with upper respiratory tract symptoms.  She had encouraged her husband to seek and evaluation for his shortness of breath earlier, but the patient refused.  He was brought to the Emergency Department at the [**Hospital1 69**] via Emergency Medical Service on the morning of admission due to extreme difficulty breathing overnight. In the Emergency Department, his vital signs revealed a temperature of 100.2, heart rate was 128, respiratory rate was 40, and blood pressure was 146/86.  He was saturating 96% on 6 liters.  A chest x-ray was done and showed no evidence of pneumonia of congestive heart failure.  Electrocardiograms were done showing no evidence of active ischemia.  The patient was given 80 mg of Solu-Medrol, 500 mg of levofloxacin, and continued on his albuterol nebulizers for a presumed acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  Initial blood gas at that time was 7.2/67/93. The patient continued to be tachypneic and breathing using accessory muscles.  Therefore, he was placed on a [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure machine with improvement in comfort level and respiratory rates.  He was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. 
This is a 74-year-old male with history of COPD, last intubated in [**6-13**], who presented with 2 days of worsening shortness of breath.  The patient stated that he developed URI symptoms approximately 3 days ago with a sore throat and cough with mild sputum production.  No fevers.  He developed worsening shortness of breath and called EMS today in distress.  Was found by EMS, bilateral wheezing, sitting upright, and short of breath.  Vitals signs in the field were blood pressure of 138/100, heart rate 130, breathing 30, 92 percent on room air.  The patient was given 2 nebs on the field.  On arrival to the ED, the patient was given 1 neb, and 1 dose of Solu-Medrol 125 mg and started on mask ventilation.  Respiratory rate and heart rate decreased and the patient appeared more comfortable.  MICU was called for further evaluation.

On [**7-14**], she was in her usual state of health when she was noted by her family to be asleep in her chair and slumped to the right at 6 p.m.  They tried to wake her a couple of hours later.  She mumbled a few words and went back to sleep.  Then at 10 p.m., they again tried to arouse her and had difficulty. She could not answer a few simple questions after much prodding and could not open her eyes. They noticed that she had a left facial droop and her left side was weak but she was able to grip her hands on either side. She was brought to [**Hospital 872**] hospital via ambulance with a head CT revealed a right thalamic hemorrhage.  She was agitated and received 1 mg of Ativan, after which she became much more lethargic.  Her blood pressure was erratic, ranging from 83 to 54 to 183/141.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 341**] for further treatment.  The patient was then transferred to Neurologic Intensive Care Unit for further management of her hypertensive hemorrhagic stroke. Magnetic resonance scan of the head revealed right thalamic hemorrhage confirmed by CT, measuring 1.2 by 1.3 by 1.5 cms. Imaging studies showed midline shift or ventricular extension.  The patient's blood pressure was vigorously controlled in the neurologic Intensive Care Unit with Labetalol and betablockers.  The patient had labile blood pressures in the neurologic Intensive Care Unit for a two to three day course but systolic pressures were maintained between 120 and 140. The patient was also treated with Levofloxacin for urinary tract infection on urinalysis. The patient stabilized in neurologic Intensive Care Unit and was transferred to the floor for further blood pressure management and disposition.  The patient's blood pressure was controlled on medication of Labetalol.  An ace inhibitor was not added to the pharmacologic regimen. The patient was then stabilized on beta-blocker and had appropriate physical therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy screens.  The patient was deemed not to be able to swallow autonomously and had percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed one day prior to discharge.  The patient finished course of antibiotics for urinary tract infection with repeat head CT later on admission showing unchanging right thalamic hemorrhage. On physical examination the patient had blood pressure of 98/60 to 190/120 on admission, which was very labile, but then stabilized throughout admission. Pulse was between 70 and 90. Respiratory rate of 13.  The patient was afebrile on admission. Throughout admission, the patient was somnolent on general examination with decreased arousability. The patient had a supple neck with normal S1 and S2, 2/6 systolic murmur. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft and extremities had no edema with distal pulses intact with no rashes.  On neurologic examination, the patient was only arousable to noxious stimuli on left side and right side on admission, with improvement in alertness and arousability prior to discharge. The patient was able to follow simple commands on the right side, with severe left neglect.  The patient was dysarthric with sparse output.  She will say name and simple phrases in response to questioning. The patient's ability to follow commands improved and she was able to perform simple commands prior to discharge.  The patient also had a right gaze deviation and a dense left hemiparesis on neurologic examination, with arm greater than leg.  The patient was unable to tract extraocular movements past the midline and unable to withdraw from painful stimulus on the left arm.  On motor examination, the patient had increased tone on the left with 4+/5 right hand grasp, triceps with the left [**2-6**] grasp; positive pronator drift on the left with difficulty assessing lower extremities as the patient could not cooperate with the examination. On cranial nerve examination, the patient had left facial droop with, as mentioned, a right gaze deviation and difficulty crossing midline.  The patient was unable to cooperative with coordination examination or gait examination. LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a video swallow study on [**7-21**] which showed no evidence of aspiration or penetration of vocal cords, with a delay in volitional 
71M with hx of HTN, prostate cancer, who presents with one week of progressive weakness and confusion, found to have hyperglycemia with fingerstick in 500s by EMS.

Selective graft vessel angiography revealed a totally occluded saphenous vein graft to OM after giving off the free LIMA to distal left anterior descending artery.  The distal left anterior descending artery supplied by the LIMA graft had mild-to-moderate diffuse disease, but had no flow limiting lesions.  The saphenous vein graft to distal RVA was widely patent, but with TIMI-I flow and injection, and supplied diminutive distal right coronary artery. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures.  There was mild pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac index is mildly reduced at 2.2. The distal right coronary artery occlusion just beyond the saphenous vein graft, right coronary artery anastomosis was successfully treated by thrombectomy, angioplasty, and stenting with no residual stenosis, no intergraphic evidence of dissection, and TIMI-III flow. During procedure, the patient required administration of dopamine due to systolic blood pressures in the 70's.  She was transferred to the CCU for further management.

36 F with 12-year hx of dystonia with some autonomic features, followed by [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 939**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 1811**] IR-guided replacement of her G-tube on [**2944-4-14**]. Per a prior note from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 939**], she was to be pre-treated with 20 mg valium, followed by 10 mg Q3hrs for up to 3 doses after the procedure. This protocol was deviated from somewhat. She received 30 mg valium during the procedure, then recived 20 mg valium on admission to the PACU at about noon on [**4-14**]. Over the course of the next 12 hours, she remained in the PACU and received an additional 32.5 mg valium plus 3 mg morphine. Although the plan was for her to go home the same day, she took a long time to rouse, and when she did, she continued to have worsened dystonia from her baseline. This has improved over time, but she states she is still not at her baseline. She will continue to be observed in the PACU overnight. 
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 13382**] is a 38 year old woman with longstanding dystonia and autonomic dysfunction who develpoed a full body dystonic reaction following IR guided replacement of her granulated G-J tube on [**2945-4-5**]. At baseline she is wheelchair bound since [**2937**] with severe dystonia of her lower extremities, but is able to use her upper extremities to transfer by herself. She also has laryngeal dystonia which has worsened over the past 6 months causing her to speak in a whisper.  She has the G-J for gastroparesis which she uses for decompression and receives her nutrition via TPN 5 days per week. She is also s/p pacemaker placement for neurocardiogenic syncope and s/p urostomy for bladder areflexia. Prior to the G-J tube replacement on [**2946-4-5**] she was at her baseline and received her daily doses of Artane and Baclofen and was given midazolam by anesthesia (due to prior dystonic reaction with propofol).  Following the case she developed a full body dystonic reaction and anesthesia felt she was not safe to go home despite diazepam 10 mg x 2, diphenhydramine 50 mg x 2. She was initially admitted to medicine for observation and spent the night in the MICU. In the MICU, she had one more episode of dystonia, where she received 20mg IV valium and 50 mg IV benadryl. Since she has been heavily sedated and hypotensive with SBP in the 70s (baseline 80s). She was initially responding to questions by blinking once for yest and twice for no, but eventually began to whisper. Neurology was consulted and she was transferred to the general neurology service on [**2946-4-6**]. Review of systems is notable for chills, constipation, headaches since last night, and intermittent lightneadedness.  She denies fevers, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.

These symptoms began on the day prior to admission, just after lunch. He noted chest heaviness and indigestion, that did feel better with belching. Later that night the indigestion returned and he took alka-seltzer with improvement. He slept through the night but at 4 a.m. on the morning of admission he got up to use the bathroom and noted heaviness in his chest, and persistent "indigestion," unresponsive to TUMS, prompting him to go to [**Hospital3 **]. Of note, his typical angina involves a tingling/numbness of his left arm, which he denies in the preceding days. At [**Hospital1 2402**], initial EKG was without ST elevations, with an isolated TWI in III. He was given a dose of dilaudid with resolution of his pain.

History obtained from her two daughters who were present at the bedside. Patient lives by herself but in a house that is right next to her daughter's on the same property. She is fully independent at baseline and drives. Her daughter last saw her nml at 5pm yesterday. The she saw that the lights turned off around 10 pm which is her usual bedtime. In the am she gets up between 5h30 and 7h30, has a regular routine of things she does, starting by putting her dentures in and her dentures where found in the sink so her daughters think she might have started her morning routine as per usual. Today at 10 am she was found by her daughter unresponsive on the floor by her daughter and seemed to have hit both sides of her head on the sink, with urinary incontinence. She apparently had an intermittent L gaze deviation. She was brought to [**Hospital3 4047**] where her SBP was 136, blood sugar 316, normal sinus rhythm. She had a head CT that was negative for hemorrhage as well as C-spine imaging. Her gag reflex was present and she was protecting airway so not intubated there. No spont mvt of L UE. She has chronic UTIs and is on Nitrofurantoin at the moment but her daughters report that she has been well over the last few days, no fever, visual changes, hearing changes, headache, neckpain, nausea, vomiting, weakness, tingling, numbness, bowel-bladder dysfunction, chest pain, shortness of breath. 
Patient is a 65 year-old male with a history of COPD on 3L home O2 (not used in weeks), HCV, EtOH encephalopathy, neuropathy/chronic pain on methadone and oxycodone presenting from dentist's office after becoming unresponsive "with eyes open" during a dentist visit. He explains that this morning he woke up and felt nauseated which he often does. No vomiting. He didn't eat anything and he didn't take any of his home medications. He went on a short walk with his girlfriend and afterwards he left for a dentist appointment. Per report the girlfriend said that on the way to the dentist he was swerving into curbs while driving and was not paying attention to lights changing, and per ED had "slumped over" by the time of arrival. According to his dentist (who I spoke to in person) he seemed fine when he arrived and remained so until a few minutes after he gave him an arcticain (similar to lidocaine) shot in preparation for a cavity he was about to fill. No complications with the injection, no excessive bleeding, and he is confident he was in the gums. He was then suddenly nonresponsive but with his eyes wide open. His dentist called EMS who arrived within minutes. He was given .5 mg narcan while en route by EMS and started to wake up. On arrival to the ED, initial vitals were 98.5 100 103/66 16 99% 3L. He was apparently "sleeping with his eyes open" and snoring. He was given 2 x .4 mg narcan, became responsive afterwards. His labs were notable for a Cr of 1.9, up from a baseline of .6, Hct 33 with baseline around 33-35, mild AG acidosis, ALT/AST of 116/115 (last ALT 155 AST 99 on [**8-9**]). He received 2 L of fluid down in the ED. He had a Tmax of 100.2 On transfer, he is awake and alert. He is being admitted to the MICU for nursing concern. Recent Pain Regimen: He reports recently having increased his pain regimen. As he recalls it he was taking oxycodone [**Hospital1 **] at baseline and then started methadone 4-5 days ago with no change in dose of oxycodone. It is not entirely clear from the records but per OMR prescriptions it looks like he has been on methadone for a while but recently had his script increased from 5mg TID to 40mg [**Hospital1 **]. There is a note in OMR from his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 2856**], who is the prescriber of his narcotics, dated [**8-27**] mentioning that he would be stopping the methadone. However, on OMR medications, a prescription was written for 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] methadone dated [**9-18**], without a no note from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2856**] in the system. According to his daughter he was taking oxycodone 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and then took a bad fall about 2 weeks ago while at home during which he hit elbow and side of head. He did not go to hospital at that time. He was then switched to methadone she thinks to try to wean him off the oxycodone. He currently does not use any other substances. Last alcohol was [**8-1**] and no regular use for a few years. No history of seizure or DTs as far as he knows. Weight Loss and Night Sweats: He reports a 30 pound weight loss over the last 2 years (since retiring) which he credits primarily to a very poor appetite as well as some dysphagia/glubus. His appetite slightly improved on megace over last few weeks but not that much. He has no pain with swallowing but reports feeling like something is getting stuck in the back of his throat. Only noted with solids. His dysphagia is mostly just "feeling like something is stuck in my throat" but he worries about choking which makes him reluctant to eat. Of note he has a history of recurrent aspirations with a prior PEG back in [**3143**]. His daughter says that he has also been complaining of "drenching night sweats" which he has reported for the past year. Other Symptoms: He notes often feeling light-headed when sits up. He takes his BPs at home and running low (SBPs 100s)lately. He has frequent falls at home. He also reports significant insomnia and vivid nightmares in the setting of PTSD from [**Country 3933**]. Recent Admissions: Of note, patient admitted in early [**Month (only) 202**] after fall, thought to be secondary to dehydration and decreased PO intake. He also had an admission 3 months prior when he was admitted for confusion, thought to be secondary to opiate overdose, and was also found to have a pneumonia. Care Providers: His daughter explains that he previously got a lot of his care at the VA but hasn't in several months. The VA actually cut him off 3 weeks ago because he was missing too many appointments. His psychiatrist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2145**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13492**] is now out of business due to a law suit. Stopped seeing him 1.5 years ago. After that he went back to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3394**] to get his pain medications. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: (+) Per HPI +hot flashes, sweats, chills all x months, + cough 
The patient is a 67-year-old gentleman with a T2 esophageal cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation and presents for resection. He underwent a lap jejunostomy and port placement on [**3408-11-29**] that went well without complication. Since that time patient was on tube feeds to help maintain his nutrition and increase his weight. He was seen in clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3409-3-16**]. At that time patietn had already completed his neoadjuvant therapy. His weight was stable, and his mood had improved. PET scan was negative for metastatic disease. It was determined that patient was no suitable for resection of his cancer. 
81F w/ history of depression in the past, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and hypothyroidism, was in usual state of health until about 2 weeks ago when she called her PCP c/o SOB and some confusion. PCP was able to set up chest x-ray, CT scan of the chest, MRI of the brain. Chest CT showing a near complete collapse of the left upper lobe of the lung, with mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, and an MRI of the brain with multiple lesions consistent with likely metastasis. Was going to have outpatient evaluation however had worsening SOB and referred to ED. On arrival was triggered for hypoxia/hypotension upon arrival. +coughing. SOB worse with exertion. No fever. No abd pain. No CP. CT on [**3-5**] showed Left upper lobe collapse, concerning for bronchogenic carcinoma. possible mets seen. In the ED, initial VS were were significant for O2 sats of 80% on room air. CXR shwoed left sided pleural effusion. She was seen by IP who placed pig-tail catheter and removed 1L fluid. Her hypoxia improved and prior to transfer she was requiring 1L NC. She became hypotensive to SBP 80 and received 1L NS with SBP coming up to low 90's. Second liter running at time of sign out. Labs signficiant for WBC of 16, Cr of 1.9 (baseline 1.0), K of 2.6. She received 40meQ KcL and K in her IVF. She was also started on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for possible PNA. Levofloxacin caused red splotches On arrival to the MICU, She is complaining of left shoulder pain with coughing and deep breaths. 
This 72 year old white female in 10 years from coronary revascularization.  She has had known aortic valve pathology for 10 years, with progressive dyspnea.  Echocardiography has shown worsening stenosis and she was admitted for surgical evaluation. 
This is a 56 year old male with a history of bipolar disorder complaining of intermittent substernal chest pain starting on [**3336-5-20**].  The chest pain became constant and markedly increased on the morning of presentation and included shortness of breath, nausea, and radiation to both shoulders.  The patient's cardiac risk factors include history of tobacco use and hypercholesterolemia.  He presented to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3027**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] CR. Electrocardiogram there showed ST elevations, V1 through V6, one in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] depressions in 2, 3 and AVF, Q waves in V1 through V3, 3 and AVF.  After catheterization ST segments remained elevated in V2 through V6 and an [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] depressions persisted in leads 2, 3 and AVF and Q waves were present in V1 through V4.  The patient was given Aspirin, Lopressor, Heparin, intravenous Nitroglycerin and Integrilin and transferred for cardiac catheterization to [**Hospital6 1739**].  Cardiac catheterization showed normal left main left anterior descending with total proximal occlusion just after a high first septal.  After crossing this with a wire, it was seen that this was actually severe proximal and more moderate distally.  These were stented with two stents overlapping.  Severe disease was also noted diagonal 2 which was not treated.  TIMI 3 flow was noted and atrial stenosis was achieved.  The left circumflex showed serial 30% lesions and a large obtuse marginal 2 had an 80% stenosis.  The left circumflex posterior descending artery was normal.  Right coronary artery showed two serial 90% lesions and a large right marginal.  Hemodynamics were normal.  Dopamine was required transorally for perfusion hypotension.

This is a 58 year old male with CAD, s/p CABG and recent PCI ([**6-20**]) on plavix and asa who presented to OSH w/presyncope/cp/weakness/diaphoreis and SOB.  The patient also reported a history of black tarry stool and lightheadedness for 1 wk with fatigue and DOE.  At the OSH on [**7-7**], in addition to shortness of breath, the patient was also found to have inferolateral ST depressions and was then transferred here to [**Hospital1 18**].  At OSH, Hct 31 and he received 2L IVF.  In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the patient was started on integrillin and heparin boluses as he had mild SSCP and continued EKG changes.  Shortly thereafter, Hct was unfortunately down to 25; integrillin and heparin were stopped and the patient was transfused 2U PRBCs.  Guiaic positive stools were appreciated and the and was taken for EGD after large black guiaic positive BM in ED.  EGD showed blood in the fundus, adherent clot to lower third of esophagus, likley evidence of [**Doctor First Name 325**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear.  The patient was subsequently intubated for airway protection and a clip was placed at the site of a 2cm M-W tear; 4 epi injections were also applied to area with control of bleeding.  He has denied any NSAID use or abd pain.  He had, however, recently been started on plavix and full strength asa from a baby asa alone after recent PCI with stent placement.  A followup EGD was performed which showed no bleeding at the site of the clip and M-W tear, but there was erosion in GE junction with active bleeding (which was treated with termal therapy for hemostatic control.).  The patient was subsequently extubated.  In total, the patient received 9units of PRBCs. 
HPI: This is a 82 year old man with PMH significant for cardiac arrest 2 months ago complicated by prolongen intubation, ATN, GI bleed, pneumonia, during G tube placement procedure, who presents from [**Hospital3 **] after an episode of hypotension the morning of [**2841-11-23**]. He was thought to still be mentating but concern was raised for infection. . In the ED, he was found to be hypotensive to the 80's with a temp of 103.8 degrees rectally. He was given 500 mg flagyl IV and blood cultures were sent. O2 sat dropped to 77% and the decision was made by his son in the room to reverse his DNR/DNI status to intubate him. His blood pressure fell to SBP 70's and dopamine was started, but this was changed to levophed after it was not found to be effective. His SBP's remained in the 70's but then gradually increased after fluid resissitation with 2L of fluid and titrating up levophed. He was given 100 of hydrocort once. A groin line was placed and he was transferred to the MICU after confirming with the son that this patient would want full medical measures administered.

70 year-old right-handed man with a history hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, "ocular migraines," and HIV on HAART presents to the emergency room for evaluation of headache. The patient was in his usual state of health until last evening (12:30 am), when after sexual intercourse, he experienced a severe, sudden-onset headache in his right temple.  The pain was sharp, pulsating, and non-radiating.  He states that it was the "worst headache of my life."  He has some nausea, but no vomiting.  He noted his right eye seemed a bit "out of focus" but noted no diplopia or vision loss.  His gait was "wobbly" and he felt light-headed, but did not fall.  He was able to fall back to sleep, without use of analgesic, after approximately 30 minutes. Upon awakening this morning, the headache was gone, though he had some paresthesias in the upper half of his right face, from the cheek upward.  He remained nauseated and unsteady on his feet.  He initially went to work, but presented to the emergency room with persistent symptoms.  Of note, he had been on a full aspirin, but had stopped the medication over the weekend in anticipation of a prostate biopsy on Friday. 
This is a 56 year old white female who was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] from the [**Hospital3 8726**] earlier in morning of admission when she was talking on the telephone with her son and suddenly complained of a severe headache and fell to the ground.  She did experience loss of consciousness and there were reported seizures lasting approximately five minutes during that time with reported decorticate posturing. EMS was called and arrived at the scene and transported the patient returned to consciousness and was following commands with no apparent neurologic deficit.  A CT scan showed subarachnoid hemorrhage with diffuse bleeding in all cisterns. 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 63-year-old gentleman with a history of chronic hepatitis B infection who had previously had hepatocellular carcinoma for which he had undergone radiofrequency ablation of a 1.3 cm segment 8 lesion in [**2698-6-14**]. In addition, the patient had segmental Caroli disease. He was evaluated electively in the hepatobiliary surgery office for possible surgical resection of a large left lateral segment liver mass which had grown from 4 x 4 cm to 9.2 x 7.5 cm in segments 2 and 3. LABORATORY DATA:  Preoperatively, his platelet count was 108. His PT was 13.0. His INR was 1.1. His BUN was 23. His creatinine was 1.5. His total bilirubin was 0.8. His alkaline phosphatase was 330. His ALT was 146. His AST was 118. His albumin was 4.2. His AFT was 54.5. His hepatitis B viral load was [**2584**] iu per ml. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted elective on [**2703-1-2**], on which day he underwent a left lateral segmentectomy  and segment 6 resection with intraoperative ultrasound. At the time of exploration, he was noted to have an enlarged cirrhotic liver but otherwise no evidence of portal hypertension. A large mass involving the lateral-most aspect of the left lateral segment was found in addition to cystic structures in the liver which contained clear fluid. The mass was confirmed with intraoperative ultrasound. Notably the site of the previous RFA was stable without evidence of recurrent disease but the patient did, by palpation of the surface, have a 1.5-2 cm nodule in segment 6 laterally and inferiorly which was confirmed with ultrasound. Please refer to the operative note for additional intraoperative details. The patient remained intubated overnight and initially required vasopressors for blood pressure support and significant fluid resuscitation for a persistent metabolic acidosis. Early in his postoperative course, by postop day two, he was found to have partial thrombosis of his portal vein and middle hepatic vein. He was started on low dose heparinization for this. Systematically, the patient's pain was controlled with intravenous narcotics, generally phentanyl throughout the course of his hospitalization. Propofol was used intermittently for sedation. His mental status never really improved during the course of his hospitalization as his multisystem organ failure as described below developed. In terms of the patient's respiratory status, the patient was ventilated initially postoperative during correction of his metabolic acidosis. His ventilatory requirements subsequently continued to increase secondary to the large volume of fluid required for his resuscitation and subsequently secondary to the development of bilateral Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient developed some degree of ARDS as well and remained quite difficult to ventilate and oxygenate. Throughout the course of his hospitalization, his oxygenation and ventilatory support requirements continued to progressively increase despite efforts at diuresis and treatment of his pneumonia with broad spectrum antibiotics. By [**1-15**], the patient was requiring between 80-100% FIO2 with maximal positive end respiratory pressure and ventilatory support and despite this, his oxygenation was marginal with PAO2 of between 50 and 65. In terms of the patient's cardiovascular status, he required moderate doses of phenylephrine initially in the postoperative period but subsequently as the patient demonstrated evidence of septic physiology with source questionable from his pneumonia or possible urinary tract infection, he continued to require increasing amounts of vasopressor support including norepinephrine and vasopressin. His persistent hypotension was not felt to be cardiogenic in etiology as he had two echocardiograms demonstrating no significant valvular disease and no significant wall motion abnormalities with a normal ejection fraction. By [**1-15**], the patient was requiring increasingly large doses of norepinephrine as well as vasopressin, maintaining a blood pressure maximally at 100-105 systolic. Throughout his hospitalization, multiple sets of cardiac enzymes were sent and did not demonstrate any evidence of myocardial infarction. He did notably develop atrial fibrillation which was felt to be secondary to the amount of fluid resuscitation and the physiologic stress that the patient was under. This was managed intermittently with calcium channel blockade. In terms of the patient's GI status, he was maintained on prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor. He did have 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 15133**] is an 89yo female with PMH as listed below who was admitted early [**8-1**] for N/V x 1 day. Per ED notes they were concerned about an underlying GI bleed given color of vomitus, but patient refused NG lavage. She was also found to be hypotensive with BPs~80's and tachycardic at outside facility. In the ED her initial vitals were T 98.8 BP 111/64 AR 106 RR 18 O2 sat 98% RA. She received Ceftazadine 1gm IV and Azithromycin 500mg IV. . At approximately 8pm on [**8-1**] the patient was found slumped to the side of bed, PIV pulled out, with large amounts of coffee ground emesis. Vitals at this time were T 99.1 BP 104/66 AR 118 RR 30 O2 sat 94% on 2L. NGT was placed and she was transferred to MICU for closer monitoring. . In the MICU patient was tachycardic to the 130s-140s and responded to two trials of metoprolol 12.5mg.  Following an uneventful stay she was transferred to the floor on [**8-4**] for further evaluation of her tachycardia.

The patient is a 57-year-old male who was at church on [**3102-6-29**], when he began having abdominal pain, mostly in the upper abdomen. He ate a small amount of lunch - salad, according to him, then felt very week and had a syncopal episode that waswitnessed. His son was called, and he brought his father to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **] forfurther evaluation. At [**Hospital1 18**], his main complaint was of severe back pain, in addition to pain in the upper abdomen. The patient has a traumatic brain injury and is able to give only a limited history. His son is able to fill in a few details. 
The patient is a 58 yo F with history of HIV (Last CD4 186 on [**10-7**]) and recently diagnosed metastatic small cell lung cancer, presenting with worsening shortness of breath x 5 days. On admission to the hospital, the patient reported she has had worsening shortness of breath over the prior 5 days to the point where she is unable to climb stairs and lie flat. She had been using her inhalers at home with some relief of symptoms. + cough with pink tinged sputum 2 days ago. Denied fevers or chills. She was started on prednisone for these symptoms by her primary doctor in the week prior to admission. She reports + pleuritic pain in right chest when coughing. Denied other chest pain, abdominal pain, urinary complaints, bowel changes, or lower extremity pain/swelling. In the ED, initial vital signs were 97.3, HR 109, BP 161/115, RR 40, O2 Sat 97% with neb. O2 sat's decreased to 88% NS. This improved with continued neb treatments to the mid 90's on 4L. Original symptoms improved with 2 combivnet nebs. She received ceftriaxone 1g x 1 and azithromycin 500mg PO x 1 because of concern for PNA. A CTA was performed and prelim read was no PE. However, the study showed new mediastinal lymphadenopathy causing lingular and left upper lobe collapse as well as a destructive lesion centered in the right third rib with invasion into the adjacent anterior chest wall and pulmonary parenchyma. She was initially admitted to OMED but immediately triggered twice for respiratory distress and was transferred to the ICU. There, she underwent flexible bronchoscopy which showed that the right upper lobe was completely occluded with tumor, and also revealed tumor in the left mid main-stem bronchus with bronchomalacia of the left mainstem that resulted in complete occlusion of the airway on exhalation. She was then transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for rigid bronchoscopy, which was performed on [**3243-12-3**]. Endobronchial tumor was debrided with APC and a Y-stent was deployed successfully. During her ICU course she was started on levo/flagyl for empiric treatment of post-obstructive PNA, but given her lack of fevers/WBC/cough, these were d/c'ed on antibiotic day #4. She was maintained on steroids and a taper was initiated. She was transferred back to the OMED service on [**3243-12-5**] for possible palliative chemo/XRT. At that point her SOB and associated chest pain had entirely resolved, and that she is in no pain. She had no F/C and denies any complaints. At 2:30 AM on [**3243-12-7**], she again was in respiratory distress, with deep ronchi and desatting down into the low 80s when not given additional oxygen. She improved with suction; however, a portable chest x-ray showed severe atelectasis of the right upper lobe as well as continued near white-out of the left side, now with even fewer visible lung markings and a more obscured hemidiaphragm. When asked about intubation, the patient was not clear on her goals and simply stated that she hoped we didn't have to do that. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for observation and closer monitoring and nursing care. She was on precautions for a positive C. diff during this admission, for which she had been prescribed Flagyl, as below. 
Morbidly obese 56F s/p chole and oophorectomy for reportedly benign dz, complicated by postop SBO secondary to dense adhesions, presented to our ER [**3-23**] w/ a history of arthralgias, myalgias and fevers. She later acutely decompensated w/ hypotension and abdominal pain, CT scan at that time revealed evidence of a thickened sigmoid colon with air outside the colon as well as in the portal vein, then had ([**3116-3-21**]) ex-lap, LOA, ant rsxn of rectosigmoid and SBR. [**3116-3-24**] ex-lap and abd washout for abd sepsis, attempted closure. [**3-28**]- another washout and attempted closure. [**3-31**]- dexon mesh closure. [**3116-4-26**]- STSG 15X25 cm to abd wound. [**4-11**]- tracheostomy. There is evidence (barium enema) of an enter-cutaneous fistula from the top of the rectal stump that empties in the right lower quadrant at the junction of the skin graft and normal skin. Due to visceral edema at the time of her inital surgery surgery, the abdominal wall could not be closed primarily but the patient was treated with an open abdomen initially and subsequently skin graft. The patient also has had an enterocutaneous fistula between the tip of the Hartmann's pouch and the skin in the right lower quadrant since the surgery. The patient now presents for takedown of the colostomy, excision of the skin graft and the mesh at the site of the ventral hernia, and takedown of enterocutaneous fistula to be followed by abdominal wall reconstruction by plastic surgery.

Pt states that he woke up morning of admission with complaint of substernal chest pain radiating to his right jaw and bilateral upper and lower extremity tingling sensation, [**5-30**] in intensity, unrelated to exertion, and lasting for approximately 6 hrs. Pain stopped at 2 pm and pt presented to ED. Patient denies ever having this type of pain before. States symptoms with last MI in [**2912**] were more agitation (reports wandering around the hospital, very agitated). . ROS on admission: increased night sweats x 2 days, HA at back of head x 2 days intermittent with no n/v/photophobia but completely resolved today, increased yellow drainage from right nostril x 1 wk, no increased cough, no abd pain, no diarrhea. Pt states these symptoms are not typical of his PCP infections since he usually feels sob and cough with clear sputum. . In ED, VS were T 100.8 rectally, BP 93/56 which decreased to SBP 80s, RR 24, HR 90, sats 99% 5L. Pt remained hypotensive with SBP as low as 75/36 and lactate returned back at 4.0. Given concern for sepsis, RIJ sepsis CVL was placed, pt was given Vancomycin 1 gm IV and Levofloxacin 500 mg IV as well as ASA 325 mg, Decadron 6 mg IV x1, 4 L IVF, and Levophed started for hypotension. EKG showed [**Street Address(2) 4727**] elevations inferiorly - cardiology was consulted who felt that pt's EKG was similar to a previous EKG when pt had been septic. Trop increased from 0.07 to 0.44. Heparin was briefly started but then stopped per cards consult (then restarted in ICU). ST elevations resolved on repeat EKG. On subsequent labs with rehydration, Hct decreased from 38 to 27 and lactate decreased to 1.1. Pt was transferred to ICU for further management. . In ICU, patient was treated with broad spectrum abx w/ vanc and CTX, given stress dose steroids, otherwise maintained on his outpatient medications.

Pt apparently had developed increasing weakness of her lower extremities with some urinary incontinence. Upon arrival to [**Name (NI) **] pt was treated with narcotics for pain of the left lower extremity and back, and developed mental status changes. Her O2 sats acutely dropped, (etiology unclear, [**3-5**] narcotics versus infiltrate), with tachycardia to 140s, hypoxia to 88%, and CTA showing RLL/RML opacity but no PE. Pt was intubated for airway protection and transferred to MICU. . MRI spine on [**1-27**] revealed severe L3-L5 spinal stenosis for which pt underwent lumbar decompression of L2-S1 on [**1-28**] with gross pus evident in epidural space. X-ray of the foot revealed left ankle fracture, for which she was placed in a walking cast. She also had cervical and retropharyngeal abscesses, for which she underwent cervical decompression and drainage of cervical abscesses, from C2-C7, with instrumentation and fusion from C3-C7, on [**2906-2-3**]. Retropharyngeal abcesses were drained, and she had bilateral knee arthrocentesis and washout for septic joints. Pt was treated with vancomycin after nafcillin resulted in rash (pt seen by derm, termed "drug hypersensitivity"). In addition, on [**1-29**] pt noted to have SVT, with rate up to the 160s, and SBP decrease. She was cardioverted x2 and started on amiodarone, which has since been discontinued. Pt seen by cardiology, without apparent further recommendation. . Pt most recently taken to OR on [**2906-2-20**] for debridement of postoperative lumbar wound, and decompression of L4-5 and repair of dural leak after pt was persistently febrile and MRI of lumbar spine showed fluid collection (+GPC per aspiration).

VS prior to transfer were BP 105/57, HR 73, RR 14, POx on 100% on A/C, TV 600, FiO2 60%, rate 14, PEEP 5. . On arrival to the MICU, he is intubated and sedated. 
This is a 75 year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma on thalidomide who was found in the field having generalized tonic clonic seizures for 20 minutes.  There was no family to provide history at this time. He was given 4 mg of Ativan at the scene which broke his generalized activity.  He was still observed to have bilateral abdominal convulsions and was then given 2 more mg of Ativan.  At this time, around 7:35 A.M. he arrived at the [**Hospital1 69**] emergency department and neurology was called.  On initial observation he was unresponsive to verbal and noxious stimuli and was noticed to rhythmic abdominal contractions.  He also had a mild right eye deviation.  He was immediately started on phenytoin and 500 mg was infused over ten minutes.  To expedite the infusion the remaining 500 mg was infused as Cerebryx.  After the Dilantin load his gaze was in primary position and there were no longer any abdominal contractions.  Stat laboratories and blood cultures were drawn.  The patient was started on ceftriaxone after an initial rectal temperature of 102.5 was confirmed.  Pertinent history from the prior notes:  "his treatment initially included radiation to an L2 plasmacytoma, as well as a full course of Melphalan and prednisone completed on [**3393-5-7**].  Since that time he was treated with pulse dexamethasone for approximately 11 months through the end of [**10-4**].  His treatments also included Aranesp every two weeks and Zometa every three weeks.  At his last clinic visit we did change Mr. [**Known patient lastname 13750**] therapy from pulse dexamethasone to thalidomide at 100 mg daily.  This was due to the fact that Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] had been on dexamethasone for almost one year. Prior to switching therapy a repeat bone marrow biopsy was done on [**3394-9-9**] which revealed a hypercellular marrow with involvement of known plasma cell myeloma as well as decreased iron stores.  There was no evidence of dyspoiesis.  Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] took approximately 19 days of thalidomide at 100 mg daily. Since the thalidomide was started e was then started on Ritalin for the side effects of slowness due to the thalidomide.

CVP was measured at [**4-9**] and she got another 2L IVF with improvement of pressures to the low 100s (total 4L given in the ED). CTA was negative for PE or dissection. Given new RLL opacities, she was given 750mg of Levoflox.  She never required pressors. She got morphine x 1 for pain. Per the ED, she transiently desatted to 73% on 6L approximately 30mins before ICU transfer; per nursing report, this occured in the setting of having recieved 4mg of morphine. Currently, T100, 98, 102/68, RR 22, 93% on 6L. On the floor, pt still feels "lousy," but somewhat better than before presentation to the ED. Having some cough since volume resucitation in the ED. 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 59 yo female with a 40 pk year smoking Hx who has had B/L pul nodules followed over the last few years.  Her RUL nodule has increased in size since [**9-16**] and a PET CT showed an FDG avid RUL mass extending to the pleura.  She has emphysema and OSA and wears O2 with activity and a CPAP mask at night.  She denies cough, hemoptysis, baseline SOB but admits to occ chest pain and frequent pul infections. 
The patient is an 81 year old female with a history of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction with three vessel disease (100% right coronary artery, 90% proximal left anterior descending artery, 90% obtuse marginal one), hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, status post cerebrovascular accident with left hemiplegia, peripheral vascular disease, poorly controlled noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, and left ventricular ejection fraction of 15% who, on [**3333-4-5**], lost her balance while walking without assistance of her cane and sustained a displaced left subcapital femur fracture. The patient was admitted and was initially hyperglycemic with an INR of 5.  She was admitted to the medicine service and reversed with fresh frozen plasma.  She underwent cardiology evaluation which revealed moderate to high risk (10% to 15%) of surgery given her reversible inducible anterior and inferior defects on Persantine Cestimibi.  Her left ventricular ejection fraction was 15% (she has three vessel disease per last cardiac catheterization). The patient underwent a left hip bipolar hemiarthroplasty on [**3333-4-7**].  Her hospital course was complicated by a fever to 103.3 ([**4-8**]), atrial fibrillation 80s to 120s and, most recently, has had two runs of seven to nine beats of what appears to be either nonsustained ventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation with aberrancy. These occurred on [**3333-4-10**].  Given the patient's low left ventricular ejection fraction, this may be an indication for electrophysiologic evaluation although, in this patient, social issues and quality of life must be taken into consideration.  The patient is being transferred to the C-Med service over the weekend for observation, electrolytes repletion and medical management until further decision regarding electrophysiologic study plus/minus pacemaker versus medical management or observation is to take place. The patient is comfortable, without chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or syncope. 
85 y/o with abdominal pain and a fib presents with 1-2 days of abd pain and "red stools", in ED was guiac positive, HCT stable but wbc with 17%B. VSS at the time.

This is a 45 year old morbidly obese woman with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries who presents with a ventral hernia and abdominal pain. She has been having chronic abdominal pain for many years but got acutely worse yesterday. She had nausea and decreased PO intake over the last 24hours.Her last bowel movement was on Saturday. She has been having nausea but no vomiting. She had flatus today. Her initial surgery was in [**3228**]; she had a ventral hernia repair and gastric bypass by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13803**]. She subsequently had a recurrence of her ventral hernia and had it repaired again when she had a oophorectomy. She has since presented multiple times to the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain. She was not found to have obstruction. Her last CT abdomen on [**3-2**] demonstrated multiple fat containing ventral hernias with no evidence of obstruction. The patient was in the process of scheduling for ventral hernia repair with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at an OSH this week. 
42-year-old gentleman with a [**Known patient lastname **] complicated upper gastrointestinal history. He presented over 10 years ago with nutcracker esophagus and underwent a [**Known patient lastname **] esophageal myotomy with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 13812**] fundoplication. This was complicated by severe erosive esophagitis and eventually an undilatable stricture requiring transhiatal esophagectomy. This was subsequently complicated by severe and unrelenting bile reflux and was treated with biliary diversion and a Roux- en-Y gastrojejunostomy. Approximately 10 months ago, he underwent a procedure to revise the gastrojejunostomy which was stenotic. He has continued to have inability to aliment himself orally with a postprandial severe pain. Radiographic and endoscopic examinations revealed an incarcerated portion of bowel in the chest to the level the main pulmonary artery. There appears to be a bezoar in the small bowel component of this and I am concerned that this is an incarcerated hernia involving part of the colon but also part of the Roux-en-Y limb. I recommended  reduction of this hernia and the possible need to revise again the gastrojejunostomy. This was planned as a joint procedure between myself, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 945**]. The patient agreed to the treatment plan.

This is a 79-year-old female who presented to the Emergency Room with several days history of a history of confusion and headache.  The patient is Haitian Creole speaking only.  The history is obtained from her daughter, as the patient herself is unable to give a history. Apparently, she had awoken the day before admission and was complaining of right sided headache.  The pain was different from her typical headache which she apparently has, but it was on the same side as usual.  She is unable to expand any further on how this was different.  She got up and dressed herself, but she put her clothes on backwards which had never happened before.  She was to have a scheduled doctor appointment that same day and she went in a taxicab, but was ill and vomited in the cab.  In the evening, she ate dinner but seemed to be acting strangely when possibly talking to people who were not there.  On the morning of admission, she again awoke and was unable to dress herself correctly. Again, she went to the primary care physician's office for a scheduled visit and was sent to the Emergency Room.  The history obtained from the patient is extremely vague and despite multiple attempts to clarify, she can only speak in generalizations.  She does, however, deny any risks, constitutional symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etcetera.

This is a 36 year old man with past medical history significant for type 1 diabetes mellitus and hypertension admitted on [**3049-11-7**] with DKA now tranferred to the floor from the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**]. Pt reports that he was in his normal state of health until eariler this month. His insulin regimen had been changed on [**10-29**]. At that time, he was changed from NPH to lantus with a regular insulin sliding scale. However, the pt reports that his blood sugars were running very high when he was just taking the lantus. Therefore, he started to also use a lantus sliding scale of his own invention at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Despite this, his blood sugars were running in the 500s or too high for the machine to quantify over this week. During this time, the patient noted that he was very fatigued and felt like sleeping all of the time. He was also drinking more water than normal. Then, yesterday, following an eye appointment the patient developed nausea and vomiting. He reports that he vomited approximately seven times. His emesis was composed of what he had tried to eat.

76 y/o man with PMH notable for gastric cancer s/p gastrectomy ([**3197**]) who presents with several episodes of bright red blood per rectum. The patient was at home and felt well yesterday. He then had vague abdominal pain last night and had [**6-18**] grossly bloody stools starting at about 9 pm. After several bloody stools, he noted dizziness with sitting up and standing. On his way to the bathroom, he fell and may have briefly lost consciousness. His girlfriend then found him passed out in a pool of blood on the floor before making it to the bathroom. He does not believe he struck his head but cannot recall exactly what happened. He then came to the emergency room at about 1 am; his last episode of BRBPR was at home. . In the ED, initial vitals were T 96.8, HR 70, BP 123/70, RR 16, 99% on RA. He had bright red blood on rectal examination but no obvious hemorrhoids. The patient was treated with 80 mg IV protonix and 4 mg IV zofran for nausea. His hematocrit was found to be 21.6 (baseline ~ 40) and he was given 2 U PRBCs as well as 2 L NS. He did not undergo NG lavage due to h/o gastrectomy. GI was contact[**Name (NI) **] and will see the patient this morning. He had a CT of his abdomen/pelvis which showed diverticulosis without diverticulitis as well as evidence of prior gastrectomy and ? roux-en-y anastomosis. . On arrival to the ICU, the patient reports that his abdominal pain has resolved. He has not had any further BRBPR since arrival at the ED. He denies any recent aspirin or coumadin use though he does take motrin about once per day on average for arthritis. He drinks beer occasionally, perhaps a few drinks yesterday during the holiday. He had some nausea with dry heaves at home but no vomiting or hematemesis. When the diarrhea started, he also had diffuse vague abdominal pain but this resolved in the ED. No headache, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or urinary symptoms. He denies any current nausea or dizziness. He has never had bleeding like this in the past.

The patient is an 83 [**Hospital **] nursing home resident with a history of Alzheimer's disease, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft who developed acute onset of abdominal pain in the morning of [**2907-6-9**].  The pain was mainly periumbilical without radiation and without fevers or chills.  The patient was taken to the outside hospital where an abdominal x-ray showed no evidence of obstruction and moderate feces.  A decision was made to transfer the patient to [**Hospital1 341**] for further evaluation. HOSPITAL COURSE:  On arrival the patient had vital signs of 98.5, 90, 161/84 and was saturating at 90% on room air, which increased to 98% with 3 liters of oxygen.  She was started on Ampicillin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl in the Emergency Department. Pertinent physical examination findings included a minimally distended abdomen with tenderness to palpation and epigastrium and right abdomen.  Voluntary guarding with minimal rebound.  Rectal examination revealed heme positive brown stool with no masses. White blood cell count was 43 with left shift.  Alkaline phosphatase was 120.  Urinalysis was negative.  Nasogastric retrieved approximately 200 cc of coffee ground material. Chest x-ray obtained revealed no obvious free air in the abdomen.  Further workup with CT revealed free air and fluid in the abdomen thought likely to be from the first part of the duodenum.  No other abnormal pathology was revealed on this CT. The decision was made to take the patient to the Operating Room where an exploratory laparotomy revealed a large duodenal perforation secondary to a duodenal ulcer.  A Billroth two, tube duodenostomy, J tube placement and antecolic gastrojejunostomy were performed over five hours. The patient was then admitted to the CICU where she remained sedated and intubated.  Triple antibiotic coverage was continued.  The patient was extubated on postoperative day number two that is on [**2907-6-12**].  Trophic tube feeds were started on postop day number three at the time the patient's white blood cell count was down to 16.8.  Results of belly swab from [**6-9**] were reported to be growing yeast on [**6-12**] and Fluconazole was started.  On postoperative day number five the decision was made that the patient was stable enough for transfer to a regular medical surgical floor.  During her Intensive Care Unit stay the patient was awake and alert following discontinuation of sedation and extubation even though she had periods of confusion possibly secondary to her underlying dementia.  Her white blood cell count continued to trend downward. On [**2907-6-15**] postop day number five the patient remained stable on the floor with satisfactory oxygen saturation on 2 to 4 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.  She received q 6 Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer treatments.  Tube feeds continued.  The patient's medications were changed from intravenous to J tube administration route.  Also on postop day number five the patient's antibiotic therapy with Flagyl, Levofloxacin and Metronidazole was discontinued.  Case management and social work in put on discharge planning was requested, which revealed the patient had a compromise family support system, but had ready access to a bed at her previous nursing home facility.  Plans were therefore made for discharging the patient back to [**Hospital 8900**] on [**6-17**]. During her entire stay on the floor the patient was kept on soft restraints following attempts by the patient to remove some of her lines.  The head of her bed was also kept elevated as an aspiration precaution.  On the night of [**6-15**] and again on the morning of [**6-16**] the patient was found to be experiencing some respiratory difficulty with desaturations to the upper 80s and then later to the mid 70s.  This was suspected to be secondary to the patient's hydration status contributing to thickening of pulmonary mucous secretions. Fluid management was adjusted to resolve this problem with orders written for installation of 750 cc of free water into her J tube in one 8 cc boluses q.i.d., q 4 Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer treatments continued as well as intermittent pulmonary hygiene treatments by suction.  A duodenal tube study was scheduled for the morning of [**6-17**] and is currently pending.  A comment on the results of this study will be noted in the patient care referral form that the patient will carry with her to her nursing home.  At this moment the patient remains stable and discharge is anticipated early in the afternoon of [**2907-6-17**].

She was discharged home on postoperative day twelve and was well for two weeks when she saw Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 463**] on [**3362-6-14**]. However, over the next few days the patient began having fevers and the same abdominal pain.  She presented to [**Hospital3 15319**] Hospital where she had a computer tomography showing a phlegmon in the lesser sac and portal vein thrombosis.  She was therefore transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] with a diagnosis of an abdominal abscess with a portal vein thrombosis.

This is a 57 year old gentleman who presents as a transfer from an OSH for evaluation of SAH. He was examining a friend's car when he suddenly developed a severe occipital headache without any precipitating factors. He reports he has no history of migraines and rarely ever gets headaches. EMS was called and he was transported to an OSH for evaluation. Per EMS run report his BP was 180 systolic which upon review of all EMS and pre-hospital records, as well as vital signs here at [**Hospital1 18**], was his history blood pressure. At the OSH he underwent CT scan which per report (imaging is unable to be viewed here as disc would not load) shows SAH in the basilar cisterns without evidence of IVH in the lateral ventricles. Following this finding he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. Upon arrival he complains of mild nausea and severe occipital headache and midline neck pain. He denies photophobia, dizziness, changes in vision, hearing, or speech. he had two episodes of emesis just prior to CT scan here and again once after his CT scan. 
56F with h/o Stage IV Ovarian CA , recurrent DVTs, morbid obesity and HTN who was sent to the ED from Oncologist's office with Creatinine of 3.2 after five days out from an Abd CT with IV contrast on [**3432-7-2**] to evaluate for peritoneal mets. She was also taking increasing doses of MSContin for pain as her kidney fxn was declining.  She has been mildly somnelent for few days PTA with occasional nausea and headache. No fevers, chills, diarrhea, hematuria, SOB. She does report decreased urine output over the past several days. . In ED, she did not have accurate blood pressure measurements secondary to her obesity and an inability to find an extra large BP cuff. Systolic BPs were recorded from the 50s to the 160s, though she had no clinical evidence of hypotension. Cardiology was called for Echo which revealed no evidence of tamponade, with nml EF. Pt received a total of 4L NS.  A left radial A line was placed, she had persistent hypotension, with her blood pressure supported with pressors and IVF in the MICU.  Of note, she had a prompt response to Narcan, so it was thought her change in mental status was [**1-25**] both contrast nephropathy and a decreased ability to metabolize opioids while she was increasing her dose at home.  Renal was consulted, and incr her renal perfusion with pressors, IVF, lasix challenges.  As obstruction was considered, a renal ultrasound on [**7-6**] demonstrated no evid of hydronephrosis.  Her Creatinine continued to improve, and at the time of her transfer to the floor, her Cr was 1.2, down from 6.6 on [**7-7**]. . She was started on a heparin drip given her h/o UE DVT in the right axillary and subclavian veins, previously managed with lovenox.  A LE doppler on [**7-6**] demonstrated no DVTs.  It is unclear why the pt was not on coumadin at home.  At transfer to floor, she was changed from heparin drip to sq lovenox. . Heme-onc also followed the pt, she is s/p 5 cycles of [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol with resistant disease and will be switched to Doxil per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15323**].  She has persistently low Hct/plt, which heme/onc feels is a likely side effect of chemo.  She is DNR/DNI.
