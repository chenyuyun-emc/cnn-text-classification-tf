The patient is a 61 year old man with a history of stage III squamous lung carcinoma, status post lobectomy and pneumonectomy on the right earlier this year, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 186**] for respiratory failure.  Two weeks prior to admission, the patient began experiencing episodes of shortness of breath, cough and dyspnea.  Echocardiogram and electrocardiogram performed at that time were reportedly unremarkable. On [**2534-9-12**], after coming home from his son's wedding, the patient became acutely short of breath, agitated and collapsed on the floor, stating that he could not breathe. His family called 911 and the patient was intubated in the field and taken to [**Hospital 187**] Hospital where a chest x-ray was reportedly normal but electrocardiogram showed transient new left bundle branch block, ST elevations in leads II through V4 and Q waves in the anterior precordial leads, all of which was new.

The patient is a 62 year-old male with a past medical history of squamous cell lung cancer treated with right total pneumonectomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on 2 to 3 liters of home oxygen with saturations in the low 90s at baseline, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was recently admitted from [**7-11**] to [**2535-7-15**] for presumed bronchitis or bronchiectasis flare here with recurrent cough, shortness of breath and fevers.  During his last admission two weeks ago he was treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare versus bronchitis with a ten day Prednisone taper and Augmentin for one week.  He underwent bronchoscopy due to concern for possible endobronchial lesion, which was normal.  Sputum sample was done at that time showed no growth.  He was discharged at his baseline function on [**2535-7-15**].  The plan was to treat him for one week of Augmentin, skip one week followed by Bactrim for one week, skip one week and then on Augmentin for two weeks for pneumonia prophylaxis.  The last dose of Augmentin was [**2535-7-18**] after being on Augmentin for only three days. He was doing well until approximately one week ago when he developed mild spasms in the afternoon that he thought was due to low potassium.

The patient did note that since [**Month (only) 213**], a Scopolamine patch was added to his regimen and has increased his secretions significantly. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Per Emergency Room, the patient appeared close to intubation upon presentation and was placed on 100% oxygen via non-rebreather with an ABG of 7.46, pCO2 of 48, and pO2 of 33.  There was a question if this was a venous gas or not.  Lasix 100 mg IV, Albuterol nebs, Solu-Medrol 600 mg IV, and Ceftriaxone 1 g IV was given to the patient.  When evaluated by the MICU shortly after arrival to the Emergency Room, the patient was weaned down to baseline of 2 L oxygen with oxygen saturation of 100% via nasal cannula.  The patient was breathing comfortably at 18-20 breaths/min.  The patient no longer complained of shortness of breath but did state that he felt slightly tired.  Chest x-ray was negative, and a CT showed no acute PE.  The patient reported that he was back to baseline in the Emergency Room.

Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 395**] is a 69 year-old female with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, COPD who presents on transfer for respiratory distress. . Per review of OSH records:  Patient presented to OSH with complaints of [**2-29**] days of cough and dyspnea.  On the day prior to transfer, she ws out in public and experienced a sudden onset of worsened dyspnea.  She asked bystanders to call EMS and by the time they arrived she was found unresponsive; did have a pulse but was cyanotic and was intubed in the field. . At the OSH, initial CXR showed congestive heart failure.  She was given IV lasix and placed on a nitro drip.  After several hundred ml of urine was produced she became hypotensive, requiring volume resuscitation and phenylephrine.  For a possible pneumonia she received ceftriaxone and azithromycin. She was transfused one unit of pRBC for a hct of 29.  An echo done at the OSH showed apical hypokinesis with a fairly preserved LVEF. . In speaking with the son, he reports that over the past six months the patient's asthma has been under excellent control. She was not requiring her albuterol rescue on most days.  It was felt that this correlated, at least in part, to leaving a home environment which had previously been infested with mold.  Over the last week or so, boxes from her prior home had been brought to her new home; it was the patient's feeling that these boxes had contained mold and were the precipitant for her current exacerbation.

72 W from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 461**] [**Country 462**], with multiple cancers including ovarian (s/p s/p TAH SBO and 6 cycles of ctaxol/carboplatinium) and cholangiocarcinoma (s/p whipple) with mets of uncertain origin to liver and lung, recently admitted [**3-20**]-22 for CAP (treated with azithro), originally admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for SOB, orthopnea, and coughing which was initially attributed to CHF, symptomatic hyponatremia (increasing confusion, lethary), and ARF.  Cards was consulted and an echocardiogram revealed a pericardial fluid collection with tamponade.  She was sent urgently to the OR for a pericardial window via L thoracotomy. She was out of the OR by [**8-11**] PM, extubated by 0400 the day of transfer, and seemed to be doing well.  She was sitting up in a chair when she was noticed to be unresponsive, but still breathing and with a pulse.  She was transferred back to her bed and at that ppint was noticed to be in full cardiac and respiratory arrest without pulse or spontaneous respirations. Patient did have a rhythm on monitor so patient was diagnosed with PEA arrest.  CPR was initiated, she received 2 amps of epi and an an of calium, she was intubated, started on Neo, and had a femoral line placed.  Within 15 minutes pulse returned.  A stat repeat ECHO was performed at that time and patient was found to have [**Male First Name (un) **] (systolic anterior motion), severe MR, and new wall motion abnormalities but no re-accumulation of pericardial effusion.  She is now being transferred to the MICU for further work-up and management.

Currently, he is dyspneic and feels somewhat better sitting up; he reports no chest pain. ROS is also positive for a nose bleed requiring ED visit several months ago (and cessation of Plavix for a few days), and currently gross hematuria after Foley placement and Lovenox.
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] is an 84 yo f h/o CRI, HTN, GERD, colon ca, neprhotic syndrome, dc'd [**4-18**] after low anterior resection of colon. Now p/w 1wk h/o diarrhea worsened one day prior to admission, found to have wbcc 30 in ED, admitted [**5-7**] and started on both p.o. vanco and IV flagyl. Began to have brbpr on [**5-13**], on [**5-18**] had flex sigmoidoscopy showing pseudomembranes with recurrent c.diff vs. bowel ischemia as etiology. Then developed some sob/fluid overload and was started on lasix and neseritide gtt's. Had had some intermittent afib which was thought to be contributing to presumed diastolic dysfunction. Tx to CCU [**2753-5-30**] for worsening tachypnea and oliguria on nesiritide and lasix gtt. Was cardioverted chemically with good result. Also developed acute on chronic renal failure for which nephrology has been following, zenith of 6.0, now back at baseline creatinine of 2.0's.
66 year old male who presented with worsening shortness of breath and hypotension. He presented to his PCP's office for follow up and was noted to be short of breath and hypotensive with SBP's in the 80's. His symptoms started approximately 2-3 weeks prior to presentation. He mainly had difficulty with shortness of breath. This shortness of breath would prevent him from sleeping comfortably. He describes symptoms consistent with orthopnea and PND. He notes that he saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] a couple of weeks ago and was started on lasix and aldactone. He was also noted to be in atrial fibrillation at that time as well.

76yo F with PAF s/p recent TEE-DCCV on [**4-17**], HTN, admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure.  She was recently hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 1894**] for a supratherapeutic INR of 16.  She was in AF with a ventricular rate of 110s-140s, asymptomatic.  Medical management of her AF was initially tried.  She was maintained on her atenolol and propafenone, and diltiazem was added.  The decision was then made to pursue cardioversion instead. TEE-DCCV was performed on [**3119-4-17**].  She was in sinus rhythm after the procedure and had a HR in the 50s on atenolol and propafenone upon discharge.  The diltiazem had been discontinued secondary to bradycardia post-procedure.  She was also discharged on Coumadin 1mg qhs.  Her family states her symptoms began just prior to discharge, when she began to feel short of breath and fatigued.  Her symptoms progressively worsened at home.  She was seen in [**Company 189**] the next morning and was found to have O2 sats in the 80s, so she was sent to the ED. . In the ED, her T was 100.6, HR 70s in NSR, and she was 84% on 4L.  Her CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions and vascular engorgement, and her INR was 9.  She received a Combivent neb, Lasix 20mg IV, levofloxacin 500mg IV, and vitamin K 5mg SC.  She was intubated for hypoxia.  Repeat CXR showed improvement in pulmonary edema after Lasix.

82yo Russian speaking F with a PMH of type II DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, obesity, pulmonary HTN and anemia, who presented to the ED this AM with worsening SOB x 2 weeks. Per the ED resident, the patient noted that she had had worsening SOB x 2 weeks (documented as 2 days [**Name8 (MD) **] RN note) and also complained of orthopnea and increasing lower extremity swelling and weeping from a venous stasis ulcer on her L shin. The patient was able to communicate this verbally to ER resident (RN notes she was only able to speak in 4 word sentences). Her VNA stated that she was only 94% on 2L O2 at home and had rales [**1-26**] way up bilaterally. On initial assessment in the [**Hospital1 18**] ER, her vital signs were T 98.2, BP 167/60, HR 61, RR 23, sats 100% on RA. On next assessment (2 hrs later), pt was felt to be very SOB while attempting to use the bed pan. RN noted her to be dusky, diaphoretic. HR 72, RR 28, sats 90% on RA. She was placed on a NRB with improvement in her O2 sats to 98%. BP rose to 210/74, then 215/93. CXR was taken and read as c/w pneumonia. Blood cx were obtained and ceftriaxone was administtered. 90 mins later, she was felt to be diaphoretic again, with increased work of breathing. Her O2 sats dropped to 90% by NRB and she was prepped for intubation. She was given 2mg versed and was intubated. SBP 210 -> 178 -> 130. She was taken to CT scan for CTA. On return from CT scan, she was felt to be bucking the vent. She was given fentanyl 100mcg, with resultant drop in her SBP to 77. She was then bolused 1L of NS with improvement in her SBP to 96.

She denies worsening dyspnea, but has only ambulated in her house as she hasn't been feeling well.  She endorses mild orthopnea.  She denies worsening lower extremity edema. Of note, patient was recently admitted for hypoxia with CXR findings of a LUL.  She had presented to her cardiologist one week prior to initial admission with complaints of worsening dyspnea and increased sputum production, without fever or leukocytosis.  At that time, cardiologist felt that patient was having an acute flare of her chronic bronchitis, and placed her on a one week course of levofloxacin.  A CXR was performed at the time to rule out pneumonia which was negative for consolidation.  She followed up with the cardiologist NP one week later, and was found to have O2Sats ranging from 68-80% on 3L NC (baseline, home oxygen).  She continued to be afebrile without leukocytosis but reported no improvement in sputum production or dyspnea.  She was sent to the ER where a repeat CXR showed bilateral upper lobe opacities concerning for pneumonia.  She was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the medicine service.  Antibiotics were not continued as patient was afebrile, without cough or leukocytosis.  Right lower extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT.  Patient was discharged home as her oxygen saturations returned to baseline on home 3L NC. [**Name (NI) **] son reports that patient had BCG vaccination in [**Country 526**].

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and history of a gastrointestinal bleed, who presented to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 69**] at 8 A.M. with epigastric pain.  The patient's pain started at approximately 7:30 A.M. on the day of admission after eating breakfast.  It was described as a burning sensation.  The patient took one sublingual nitroglycerin without effect. The patient reportedly denied any shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, or headache.  The patient had been off her aspirin and Plavix secondary to a gastrointestinal bleed in [**3264-2-22**], requiring hospitalization at [**Hospital3 1181**]. Electrocardiogram obtained in the Emergency Department showed upsloping ST segments and was initially interpreted as J-point elevation.  Subsequently at 1 P.M., the patient's systolic blood pressures decreased to the 40s and repeat electrocardiogram at that time revealed bigeminy with ST elevations of 5 mm in V2 through V4.  Cardiology team was consulted, and the patient brought emergently to the catheterization laboratory with systolic blood pressures in the 80s. In the catheterization laboratory, the patient's blood pressure was marginal, with pressures between 70s and 80s systolic, and dopamine drip was started.  Initial angiogram showed significant left anterior descending obstruction. Intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.  The patient was then electively intubated, as oxygen saturations were decreasing on non-rebreather mask.  Arterial blood gas as that time was a pH of 7.16, pCO2 of 51, and pO2 of 51.
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease with recent CCU stay and autoimmune hemolytic anemia who presented again to the CCU after being admitted to the floor with a two-day history of weakness, increased shortness of breath, decreased She had stent to the left anterior descending at an outside hospital in [**3264-1-22**].  She then represented to [**Hospital6 1739**] on [**3264-4-16**], with her anginal equivalent (epigastric pain) and was found to have ST elevations on her electrocardiogram in leads V2-V5.  She had a complicated emergent catheterization.  The catheterization placed on Dopamine and intubated. On catheterization, the patient had in stent restenosis of the left anterior descending, and she received percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.  A lesion of the ramus intermedius was stented as well.  Intra-aortic balloon pump was initiated at that time. She had a four-day stay in the CCU when she was able to be taken off the balloon pump and ventilatory support.  She did have an episode of acute hypoxia after transfer to the floor that improved with diuresis and nitrates.  She was discharged two weeks to this current admission to a nursing home. On presentation to the Emergency Department the patient had a heart rate of around 100, and systolic blood pressure in the 80-90s.  Hematocrit was down to 24.5.  Hematocrit on discharge from her prior hospitalization was 33; however, her baseline hematocrit is in the mid 20s.  She was transfused 1 U of packed red blood cells in the Emergency Department.  She had no electrocardiogram changes on arrival to the Emergency Department. Upon arrival to the floor, she had acute decrease in oxygen saturations to the low 80s with tachypnea and tachycardia to the 150s.  She was given intravenous Nitroglycerin drip, intravenous Lasix, and intravenous Lopressor 2.5 mg, as well as IV Morphine 2 mg.  Her ABG showed a pH of 7.19, and a pCO2 of 48, and a pO2 of 56.  The patient was intubated and transferred to the CCU.  Her electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with unchanged segment elevations in V2-V4 compared with baseline.  Her chest x-ray was consistent with increasing congestive heart failure compared with earlier in the day.

Pt's a 82 yo F with h/o HTN, h/o of prox a-fib, (not on coumadin), mood disorder on depakote (has had since CVA 4 yrs prior), with prior L inferior division MCA infarct now presenting with altered mental status.  Pt basically at baseline AA0x2, has been reclusive living alone with mood disorder since her stroke - but has family heavily involved in her care - including ex-husband who visits daily.  Pt basically has been at her baseline (which is described as more aggressive - usually asking her family to leave within 10-15minutes of being around her), but then 3-4 days ago noted being more lethargic - less aggressive but without any other notable complaints per ex-husband who saw pt then (no report of CP, F/C, HA, SOB as best assessed).  Family getting concerned - were thinking would be needing more higher level care placement as pt generally weaker (no focal weaknesses) - but Sunday started appearing at baseline again.  Pt was seen Monday early and was doing well (has called ex-husband roughly around 2pm and noted again at her baseline) - however when home aide came by apartment today in the morning - pt did not respond to door - found lethargic with emesis/stool/urine around her.  No further information able to be obtained related to any events preceding to the evident n/v, bowel/stool incontinance. <br> Pt denies any cp, ha symptoms - can not elaborate further - was sent to ED - noted aggitated, +echolalia described in ED and from home aide initially - all consistant per family with her prior CVA 4 yrs prior.  CT head without sig changes - however noted poor quality due to aggitation - neurology consulted. Noted trop elevated 1.12 - cardiology called - stated will not cath at present but for full medical treatment.

On arrival to floor - pt much calmer - not in restraints - family at bedside. <br> In [**Name (NI) **] pt treated with hep gtt, ASA/Plavix (though pt refused to take), IV metoprolol (due to declining po meds), and vanc 1g/ceftriaxone 1g - for emperic treatment with leukocytosis (d/w ED resident - they stated just emperic tx with leukocytosis - were not aiming towards meningitis at time or any focal infection). <br> ROS: pt unable to appropriately respond to full questions.
This is a 64-year-old man with an extensive cardiac history including coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction times two, status post multiple interventions, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction less than 20%, ventricular tachycardia, status post AICD placement in [**2974**], who presented to the Emergency Department after syncopal episodes and AICD firing. The patient noted three days prior to admission, feeling of palpitations especially when lying down for bed.  On the day of admission, the patient became lightheaded a while, bending down to tie his shoes and felt some palpitations.  He then felt a shock from his ICD.  He, thereafter, awoke on the floor.  Over the course of the day, he had three more episodes, a feeling of palpitations, and lightheadedness followed by a shock and then losing consciousness. In the Emergency Department, the patient was observed to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia consistent with atrial fibrillation in the setting of his underlying left bundle branch block.  While in the Emergency Department, he developed transient regular wide complex tachycardia to approximately 170 beats per minute.  His ICD fired during this rhythm and was subsequently degenerated into a ventricular fibrillation, prompting the ICD to fire again, recovering the rhythm back to atrial fibrillation.  An amiodarone load was begun and the patient appeared to spontaneously convert to sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block.  The ICD settings were increased while the patient was in the Emergency Department so that the first shock administered was increased from 12 to 24 joules.  The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for continued intravenous amiodarone loading and further evaluation.
This is a 64-year-old man with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy who presents with five days of shortness of breath.  He developed the shortness of breath in the setting of cough, lethargy and subjective fevers.  He presents to the Emergency Room where he was found to be significant dyspneic.  Physical examination revealed evidence of pulmonary edema and a chest x-ray showed bilateral infiltrates.  His oxygen saturation was 86% on room air.  His ABG was 7.54, 48, 27.  He was given supplemental oxygen and 60 mg of IV Lasix with a good response and his oxygen saturation increased to 90% on three liters.  He was admitted to the cardiac floor with a diagnosis of a CHF exacerbation. About one hour after arriving on the floor, about five hours after presentation, he was found to be acutely hypoxic with an oxygen saturation in the low 80's despite being on 100% non rebreather.  EKG showed possible inferior ST elevations in the setting of a paced left bundle branch block.  He continued to be hypoxic despite an additional 200 mg IV of Lasix, Heparin and a Nitro drip.  For this reason he was emergently intubated and transferred to the CCU. On arrival to the CCU he was noted to have a temperature of 103.5.  His heart rate was increased and his blood pressure was low.  His urine output dropped off.  He was started on Dopamine and his Nitro drip was stopped.  He was also started on Vanco, Levo and Flagyl.  As he defervesced, his vital signs stabilized and he began to have normal urine output again.
The patient is a 77 yo M with h/o CHF c/o dyspnea and 23lb wt. gain in last 10 days.  The patient was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] 10 days ago.  He has been followed closely by VNA and his cardiolgoist.  His lasix doses have been progressively increased but his weight has been going up and he has been having worsening SOB.  Denies CP, SOB, fevers, chills. . In the ED, initial vitals were 97.7 94 125/69 24 83%4L. O2 sat's improved to the high 90's on NRB. BNP >3000. He received a total of lasix 80mg IV x 1 and had 1900cc urine output. . In the MICU, the patient was started on Bumex IV 2mg prn dosing for goal I/O of 1-2L negative daily with good effect. He was restarted on spironolactone as well and has continued to diurese with improvement in his symptoms. His verapamil was transiently stopped on [**1-22**], and patient subsequently developed atrial tachycardia, thought to be MAT,(which it was not)and was started on a dilt drip and digoxin loaded. Dilt was transitioned to PO verapamil, and he has been continued on the dig. HR appears to be well controlled at this time. Additionally, he developed increased erythema of his left lower extremity at the site of his prior cellulitis, and blood cultures from that day grew coag neg staph 2 out of 2. He was initially started on Vanc IV and this was changed to tetracycline as a result of the patient's allergies. He is currently on day 3 of 7. . The patient reports he is feeling much better, though not quite to baseline. His SOB is much improved and he feels his ascites is reduced. He denies fevers, chills, night sweats, headache, chest pain, diarrhea, dysuria, melena or hematochezia. He does report abdominal distention which is improved. Has 2 pillow orthopnea at baseline and denies PND [**2-27**] using BiPAP at night. Additionally, denies stroke, TIA, DVT, PE, joint pains, hemoptysis or exertional buttock or calf pain. He does report a chronic dry cough which is at his baseline. .
77yo M w/ COPD with interstitial lung disease, pulm HTN, severe cor pulmonale, and chronic renal disease who p/w worsening SOB, increasing abdominal girth, and 20 lb wt gain for 2 weeks. Pt reports feeling exhausted and "terrible." He is becoming short of breath after walking ~20-25 feet from the bathroom to the living room, having stop and catch his breath, which is unusual for him.  At the same time, he was noted to have increasing weight--a gain of 20 lbs over 2 wks (198 -> 218 lbs). Accordingly, he then developed "belly pain" and began having trouble buttoning his pants over his growing abd. Because of these increasing symptoms, he was brought to the ED for further evaluation. Of note, the pt has had a precipitous decline in his functional status since [**1-1**] primarily due to symptoms of end-stage cor pulmonale from his severe pulm disease.  In [**2-2**], pt developed similar symptoms of SOB, abd distension, and wt gain and was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] for a total of 12 days. Pt otherwise denies fever/chills, chest pain, palpitations, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, headache/dizziness, or incontinence.
77 y/o man with PMH significant for severe right sided heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, COPD with interstitial lung disease, and chronic kidney disease who presents with 3 day hx of ulcer on his right leg, pt denies trauma to leg, fevers or sweats. At baseline, pt has mild pedal edema, and there was no significant swelling of the right leg. Pt has some baseline erythema of bil lower legs, but noted moderate increased erythema around ulcer and 'pus' which he described as yellow. The patient is on home 02 around the clock and has been on 4L NC for several months. Pt has had no recent changes in his breathing at home and normally sats in the low 90s, he denies new SOB or dyspnea. He has a chronic cough, which has not changed recently. He sleeps on his side on 2 pillows and denies PND. He has had no chest pain. He denies hematemesis at home.

Pt is a 78 yo f with h/o COPD with home O2 3L requirement, CAD s/p CABG in [**2965**], CHF with EF 30%, PVD s/p aortofemoral bypass, RLL granuloma, HL, and h/o dementia who presents to the ED in respitatory distress. Pt and son gave history in the [**Name (NI) **] that that she became more SOB with increased o2 requirement (unknown how much she increased it to). She came in to the hospital tonight for SOB and reported some increase in her allergies but no fever. In the ED her vitals soon after arrival were HR 110s BP 194/79 RR30 o2 sat 94% on 8L face mask. She was found to be in obvious respiratory distress using accessory muscles, tachypnic, poor air flow, and speaking in one word sentences. She became diaphoretic with CP and got 0.4mg of SL nitro with resolution of chest pain. She became tachy to 123 with RR 37 and BP 200/90 then was started on a nitro gtt at 2mg/kg/hr which was increased to 3mg/kg/hr. At some point dropped her sats to 85%. She was started on BiPAP with obvious improvement. Her CXR showed pulm vascular congestion. She was given 2mg IV magnesium, solumedrol 125 IV x1, azithromycin 500mg for COPD exacerbation. Her EKG showed sinus tach with prominent p waves and LVH as well as ST elevation in v1 & v2 which was similar to prior. Cardiology was consulted and said this is likely strain in the setting of respiratory distress. Exam notable for wheezes, poor air movement, and rhonci throughout. She received 20 IV lasix prior to leaving the ED. Vitals at time of transfer were HR 101 BP 159/64 RR30 02 sat 100% on BiPap.

The patient is a 58 year old male with a past medical history remarkable for pericarditis, diverticulosis, status post colostomy and take-down, obstructive sleep apnea, who was evaluated for painless jaundice in [**3476-11-29**].  The patient's CT scan revealed 1.6 by 2.0 centimeter Klatskin tumor with no evidence of liver mass nor encasement of vessels.  The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which showed normal pancreatic duct but biliary stricture, consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.  A stent was placed in the upper third of the common bile duct.  An MRCT in [**3476-11-29**], revealed a 2 centimeter mass in the porta hepatis consistent with cholangiocarcinoma, with extensive periportal lymphadenopathy. After a long discussion with the patient and family members, the patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**3477-1-15**].
This is a 61-year-old female who has a history of a left femoral to above-knee popliteal bypass with prosthetic due to a previous harvesting for CABG of her saphenous vein. The patient also has a history of stenting and angioplasty of the distal popliteal artery. The patient presented to the hospital with increasing left foot pain and was found on angiography to have a completely thrombosed prosthetic graft. She had suitable runoff from the below-knee popliteal artery and the decision was made to perform a redo bypass operation.
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2218**] is a 70yoF with h/o dilated cardiomyopathy [**12-22**] aortic outflow obstruction, AICD s/p VT, CAD, COPD (on home O2) who presented with decreased UO and SOB, now transferred from medicine service to CCU for hypotension. Pt is currently somnolent and unable to provide a detailed history, so details are obtained from OMR and Atrius records.  Pt saw NP in complex care clinic on [**6-29**], at that time felt well overall, c/o dry cough but denied SOB, peripheral edema. At that time her weight was recorded at 185 lbs (dry weight is estimated at 184 lbs). On [**7-6**] she called the CCC office c/o minimal urine output ("only drops") and cough productive of yellow sputum.  She reported compliance with her home diuretic regimen, but [**Name8 (MD) **] NP note she had not filled her aldactone rx. . On DOA, she called EMS due to increasing SOB.  When EMS arrived her SBP was 80.  She received 250cc NS and was brought to ED. In ED she had SBP 90s so received another 500cc NS bolus. CXR showed no e/o infiltrate but she was treated empirically for CAP with 1g ceftriaxone given her recent productive cough. Labs were significant for Na 121 and Cr 5.4 (baseline 3.5-4.0). She was admitted to medicine service.  On the floor, her BP was initially 98/65 but then decreased to SBP 70s.  She was transferred to CCU for pressor support. .

The patient also reported recent fever and chills.  In  the ED, patient had a low grade temperature of 100.5 degrees.  Her abdomen was slightly distended, with no rigidity or rebound. Admission laboratory data were notable for WBC 6.2, elevated transaminases, and INR 3.7.  Right upper quadrant ultrasound disclosed a 5 mm gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder. There was also a 5mm  gallstone in the common bile duct, without ductal dilatation.  The patient was evaluated by surgery for her choledocholithiasis.  The patient was also seen by the ERCP fellow.  The patient was not acutely ill last night, so she was admitted to the Medicine team, with plan for ERCP today. She was kept NPO and was administered IVF overnight. This morning, she was administered 4 U FFP to reverse her INR. After receiving 2 U FFP, she became hypoxic, with O2 sats dropping to the 70s.  She was placed on 100% NRB with improvement in her O2 sats to the 90s. Prior to dialysis, she was given 100 mg IV Lasix, with urine output (non measured).  At 1:50 PM, she was transferred to the Hemodialysis Unit for initiation of hemodialysis.  Approximately 1 L was removed, yet the patient remained in respiratory distress, with O2 sats in the low 90s on NRB.  At 2:30 PM, a respiratory code was called since patient's O2 sats dropped to 70s on the NRB.  The patient was emergently intubated.  ABG prior to intubation was 7.21/55/55.  EKG disclosed new ST segment depressions in the inferior and lateral leads.  Following intubation, the patient's SBP dropped to 80s.  She was administered approximately 500 cc NS bolus, and required Dopamine transiently.  The patient was transferred to the MICU for further management.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 2357**] is a 66-year-old male with hx HIV on HAART, lymphoma, LUL lung adenocarcinoma s/p resection, hx CAD s/p PCI with DES in [**5-21**] to proximal circumflex artery. In [**11-20**] he had elective cath showing 90% restenosis at proximal edge of previously placed stent, treated with overlapping Cyper stent. Mid-RCA was 80% occluded and treated with DES as well. In [**2-21**] pt had a left femoral artery to dorsalis pedis artery bypass graft with an in situ greater saphenous vein graft. His plavix was discontinued at that time. He was recently admitted on [**2563-5-4**] w/ STEMI over III, F, taken to cath, where he had a DES placed in the LCX for the vessel being occluded by a thrombus proximally. Of note, at cath [**5-4**], he had a totally occluded right external iliac artery. The pt was discharged home [**2563-5-7**]. Since that time, per the pt, he felt at baseline, with the exception of intermittent left leg pain (s/p vascular surgery, bypass) that would occasionally awaken him at night. He stated he was up this morning at 4am b/c of this left leg pain, when he developed a "cold rough" feeling in his esophagus similar to his pain that he had with all of his prior MIs. He states it was a [**5-28**] in severity. He took 1 nitro, and it resolved. He reports he did not take his plavix yesterday and today. He noted intermittent right sided chest pain as well last night, which felt like "gas pain", + SOB, no diaphoresis, + nausea, no vomiting. He states the feeling returned and then persisted, took a 2nd nitro but it only decreased the pain to a [**2567-2-19**]. He called 911. . In the ambulance, the pt's pain decr to [**1-28**] and he received ASA, another nitro en route. His pain, however, only resolved completely on nitro gtt at OSH where he was given ASA, IV integrillin, IV heparin, started on nitro drip with full resolution of pain, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath. His initial BP at OSH 130/75, down to 93/63 after nitro. Outside labs with CK 60, other ezymes pending at time of transfer, BNP 17. . At [**Hospital1 18**], he was given plavix 600mg load prior to cath. In the cath lab: LCX was totally occluded within proximal stents. A wire was passed and flow was reestablished (likely development of blood clots). 1 additional bare metal stent (no DES since he had questionable compliance w/ plavix) placed distal to last stent. Some non-occluding stenosis in the distal branches. Cath was performed via radial artery (per lower ext arterial disease). His right groin (femoral vein) developed a hematoma. His left groin was not accessed given his c/o left leg pain post surgery 2 months ago. He was subsequently transferred to the floor. He then had BP drop to 90s/40s-50s and a pm HCT was found to be 27.7 (6 point drop from pre-cath HCT). He is being transferred to the CCU for unstable HCT and hematoma with labile BP s/p catheterization today. . Brief CCU event: CT scan of abd neg for RP bleed. Neg groin for psuedoaneurysm. Stable hct. Received total of 3 units of blood. 2 unit pRBC for hct 27 ([**5-13**]) -> 31.6 ([**5-14**] Am)-> 29.5-> 28.2 ([**5-14**] 1pm)->32.3 ([**5-14**] 12pm)-> 31.8 ([**5-15**] 4am)

The patient was a 73-year-old female admitted to the CCU on [**3234-3-20**] with hyperkalemia and bradycardia.  The patient had a past medical history significant for hypertension, glaucoma, and breast cancer treated with lumpectomy, XRT in [**3228**].  She was in her usual state of health until [**1-1**] when she began to note shortness of breath.  She saw her PCP and performed [**Name Initial (PRE) **] chest x-ray, which revealed a right upper lobe density.  This was followed up with a CT scan, which revealed a lobulated mass of 2.3 cm in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe and bilateral lobe interstitial fibrosis.  Follow-up PET scan was nondiagnostic.  The patient had a mediastinoscopy, which showed no evidence of malignancy or lymph nodes.  Lung biopsy was performed, which revealed pulmonary fibrosis.  Subsequent spirometry revealed a mild restrictive defect.  The entire picture was thought to represent UIP. On [**3234-3-20**], she presented to the [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 2114**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with a complaint of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea times several days.  In the waiting room, she developed presyncope.  She was urgently brought to the trauma bay, there her heart rate was in the 30s with the EKG revealing a junctional rhythm.  Her SBP was in the 80s. Attempts made to place a temporary pacing wire but during the procedure the patient suffered respiratory arrest.  She was intubated and resuscitated, and a line was successfully placed.  Subsequent labs revealed a potassium of 9.8.  The patient was treated with calcium bicarb, insulin, and glucose and admitted to CCU. In the CCU, the patient was started on Levophed and dopamine for hypotension.  Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to evaluate her hypotension and revealed an SVR of 2473 with a cardiac output of 2.2.  Two hours later, the cardiac output was 6.5 and SVR was 898 after pressors were weaned down.  Urgent TTE revealed normal systolic function, no pericardial effusion. Potassium dropped to 4.3 after 1 day.  The patient was empirically treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for hypotension, which was thought possibly due to sepsis. By hospital day 3, she was off pressors, her white blood count was 16.1.  She was successfully extubated, and her potassium remained normal.  By hospital day 4, she continued to have mild respiratory distress despite being extubated. She was thought to be in mild CHF.  She was diuresed. Levofloxacin and vancomycin were continued for possible pneumonia.  By hospital day 5, she developed worsening respiratory distress, and the patient agreed to elective intubation.  She was then transferred to the MICU for further workup and care.

81 yo woman with PMH signficant for SLE, gout, CHF and MVR, severe osteoporosis who was admitted on [**2648-11-16**] to [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 1441**] from NH, c/o bilateral hip pain. She denied trauma but had an overlying hematoma on the right side, however she does not "recall anything" at this point. Plain x-rays showed bilateral hip fractures, intratrochanteric on one side and femoral neck on other. The patient was initially hypotensive to the 80s but then responded to fluids. She was admitted to Medicine due to medical comorbidity. Surgery was initally planned for [**2648-11-21**] but on that day, she developed hypoxemia and cyanosis and CXR showed pulmonary edema, so she was diuresed with Lasix and Bumex and she did well though her O2 sats remained in the high 90??????s on 2-3LNC. Cardiology and Pulmonary were consulted. Pulmonary felt, that she likely has interstitial underlying lung disease as well that is contributing to her hypoxemia. Duonebs were given. She was continued on betablockers for rate control but Coumadin was held. She was not on any other form of DVT prophylaxis or anticoagulation. She was also found to have a UTI from ESBL-E.coli and was treated with Zosyn. The patient was also noted to be thrombocytopenic, chronically around 65K which was attributed to SLE. Her anemia was ranging around a Hgb 8.3-8.5. She was transfused 1 Unit PRBC??????s, Hct 27.9 prior to transfer. The patient also has ARF with an unclear baseline (last 1.0 in [**2642**]) now Creatinine 1.2 per last report. . She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2648-11-26**].  She was evaluated by orthopaedics for operative repair of her hips.  She was assessed to be fluid overloaded as part of her hypoxia.  Diuresis was started.  There was concern about a PE, so a CTA was done on [**11-27**] which showed no PE, but did show bilateral pleural effusions with patchy ground glass opacities, apical interlobular septal thickening and peripheral reticulation. There was mediastinal and hilar adenopathy. . The decision was made to diurese further, and her oxygen requirement was decreased from 3L to 1L nc.  She had a repeat UA which showed E.coli that was sensitive to bactrim, so the zosyn was changed to bactrim. . On [**11-29**] she was felt stable to go to the OR the following day for possible surgical repair of both hips.  On [**11-30**] she was taken to the OR and the left hip repair was started.  She was noted to have a large amount of bleeding, and an intraopeartive hct was 21% (from 30% the previous day).  She was given 3u PRBC intraoperatively.  She was noted to have an arrhythmia vs ST depressions on telemetry during this time.  The decision was made to not proceed with the right hip at this time. . There was a postoperative attempt at extubation, which per report she failed due to rising CO2. . At this time she is intubated, on a propofol gtt. . [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 576**] NH, no evidence of trauma.
History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 79 y/o Russian speaking female with a hx of Pulmonary MAC diagnosed in [**2723**], on standing clarithromycin, ethambutol and rifampin, complicated by bronchiectasis who presented from home with worsening shortness of breath, cough and sputum production for 2 days.  Patient reports that yesterday her breathing started becomming more difficult with increased cough productive of yellow/clear sputum without associated fevers or chills.  Her breathing improved with clearing of her secretions, however this morning she was unable to produce any phlegm and her breathing became much more labored.  She presented to the ED due to worseing SOB.  She denies recent chest pain, pleuritic pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  Per her husband she has had less energy and decreased appetite since her last hospitalization, however her breathing had been stable until 2 days ago. Patient denies night sweats, however, reports increased weight loss over the past months. . Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-19**] with similar complaints.  Imaging at that time showed progression of widespread small airway bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis.  She was admitted to the ICU however did not require intubation or steroids.  She completed 5 days of cefepime per ID recommendations and completed an additional 10 day course of cefpodoxime 200mg po BID for presumed CAP. . In the ED VS initially showed T 96.7 BP 149/84 HR 89 RR 28-48 O2 sat 97% on RA.  CXR showed interval improvement in the multifocal patchy opacities previously noted.  She was given one dose of cefepime and ASA 325mg x1.  She was placed on oxygen for comfort and then desaturated into the 80's and was placed on NRB with inc. in her oxygen sat to 100%, however she remained tachypneic.  Due to inability to wean off NRB she was admitted to the ICU for further treatment.
HPI: 87yo man with h/o CAD s/p CABG [**2595**], mult PCI since, ischemic CMY with LVEF 35%, Afib on coumadin, possible AS and/or MR, diet controlled DM2, ?CRI, gout, who presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital at 4am on [**2610-7-22**] with pain in his epigastrium and chest, and was transferred here out of concern for cholangitis. The patient reports intermittent discomfort in his chest and epigastrium which began 1-2 weeks ago, with no precipitating factors such as exertion or food. He describes it as a cramping pain, with radiation to his R shoulder, but not to his back or arms. He did say that it felt worse at night while lying down. The pain felt different than his prior angina, and he treated it with Tylenol with some relief. However, on the night PTA, the pain recurred and he was unable to get back to sleep. His wife called EMS, and he was [**Name (NI) 3985**] to [**Hospital **] Hospital. ROS is notable for: chronic DOE, prehaps with some increase over baseline; increase in his RLE swelling (has chronic L>R edema from prior surgeries; denies F/C/V, diarrhea, constipation, changes in stool or urine color or frequency. He does have some erythema and swelling of his left 5th digit, which started 3 weeks ago, and which he thinks may have been from a bug bite. At [**Hospital **] Hospital, he was found to have EKG without change and normal cardiac enzymes. CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions, L>R. He was felt to be in CHF on exam, given Lasix for diuresis. His labs came back with WBC 12.4 with 88% PMNs, 8% bands, and abnl LFTs (AST 122, ALT 54, AP 307, TBili 3.3, DBili 2.5, TProt 7.3, Alb 3.5). His lipase was elevated at 2214, and his BUN and Cr were elevated at 36/1.4, unclear if chronic or acute. An abd u/s revealed several small gallstones in the gallbladder, without thickening of his GB walls, and with no biliary dilatation. He received Levaquin + CTX, vomited once and received Zofran. His INR was 2.8, and he was given 5mg Vit K sq once (no FFP). After discussion with the ERCP fellow at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was transferred here for further care and plan for ERCP.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 23**] is a 76 yo M with h/o CAD, CHF, a-fib, AVR, DM, HTN, HLD, p/w one day of fever, rigor, nausea and vomiting. Pt felt sudden onset rigor one day ago, with fever to 100, and BP reportedly to 220/120 at home. He had some valium and was able to sleep. He  Of note, pt did not have recent sickness, no weight loss, night sweats. He did report some exercise intolerance recently in the gym, which he attributed to hypoglycemia. Of note, pt had a PCI with 2 drug eluting stents placed in LAD and R-PDA. Pt had no recent dental work and never had colonoscopy. Pt went to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] today, where he had VS: 102.1 HR: 101 BP: 123/49 Resp: 23 O(2)Sat: 100%. Lab showed WBC of 11.3 with 7% Bands, INR 3.2, Cr 2.4, CK 1400, CK-MB 6, Trop 0.035; and moderate hepatocellular transaminitis. Pt underwent noncontrast CT-head, which did not reveal acute intracranial bleed. Blood culture later grew GPC in pairs and clusters. Pt received 2L IVF and one dose ceftriaxone / zosyn, and transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **]. In [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **], patient was switched to nafcillin once cultures showed MSSA. After starting nafcillin, his urine output diminished significantly and his creatinine bumped. At this time, the patient presented to our service.
76M complicated past medical history including CAD status post CABG, s/p stents [**Month (only) **]/[**3071**] (on aspirin and plavix), status post biologic AVR, CHF with EF 35-40 %, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on coumadin (now off secondary to recent epistaxis requiring blood transfusion), history of strokes, CKD (baseline Cr 2.5) with recent kidney injury thought to be secondary to AIN from naficllin requiring hemodialysis, now off. He presented to [**Hospital1 **] with lethargy. Patient states that he awoke this morning feeling unwell. He had no specific or localizing signs. He was recently discharged from [**Hospital3 4043**] on the [**Hospital **] Rehab Facility 3 days prior to presentation. He had been there since an admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for MSSA bacteremia complicated by what appears to be acute kidney injury from acute interstitial nephritis thought to be secondary to nafcillin. He also developed diffuse skin vasculitis at that time.  He had been on steroids which had been tapered to off about 2 weeks ago.  He has also had intermittent delirium and volume overload.  It appears an NSTEMI also complicated his course. He had an episode of epistaxis for which he was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] from [**12-14**] to [**12-16**] with an INR greater than 10 at the time.  He is no longer on Coumadin but he is on aspirin and Plavix.  He has had no further bleeding.  He has also had recent transaminitis thought to be secondary to amiodarone and statin. He had had a right upper quadrant ultrasounds which did not reveal acute cholecystitis but did show gallstones in the gallbladder.  His amiodarone has been discontinued but it appears he is back on his simvastatin. At [**Hospital1 **], the patient complained of pain in his penis from Foley catheter insertion in the emergency department. He denies shortness of breath, fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain.  He notes a mild nonproductive cough over the last few days.  He reports his white blood cell count has been elevated intermittently in the past.  It was elevated at NewBridge; however, repeat was normal and he was sent home. Per his wife he had an episode of confusion in the morning with some urinary incontinence.  He is now back at his baseline.  He is AAOx3. It was also noted that he has had recent increase in lower extremity edema which was thought to be secondary to his prednisone. His lasix was increased to 80 mg PO BID from 40 mg PO BID about a week and a half ago. His lower extremities have improved in terms of swelling. He also reports improvement of the vasculitic rash now scabbing. For his diabetes, his lantus was recently increased from 22 units to 26 units as he has been having elevated blood glucose which began at NewBridge on the [**Doctor Last Name **]. In the ER at [**Hospital1 **], he was found to have acute renal injury with Cr of 3.1 (baseline ~ 2.5) as well as hyperkalemia (K 6.1). He was treated with 8 units of IV insulin, Kayexalate, and calcium gluconate. He was also given 2.5 L of IVF per records. CXR was felt to show possible left lower infiltrate. He was given levofloxacin and vancomycin. Studies were significant for: Na 132 K 6.1, Cl 99, HCO3 26, BUN 71, Cr 3.1, Glc 355 WBC 16.6(H), Hct 30.6, Plt 376 MCV 81 with Diff N 77, M 13 INR 1.4 ALT 282, AST 533, ALP 618, Tbili 0.68, albumin 2.1 CK 56, Troponin 0.65 BNP 33,541 Lactate 2.7 UA: Blood moderate, nitrate, LE negative, RBC [**4-10**], WBC 0-2, Occ epi EKG: NSR at 77 bpm, PR prolongation, RBBB.

69 y/o female wtih PMH significant for ESRD on HD, type 2 DM, and recent PE resulting in PEA arrest admitted through the ED with sepsis of unknown etiology. Pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**9-18**] thorugh [**9-25**] with hypotension thought to be secondary to overdiuresis at HD. However, a septic component to the hypotension was also considered as the pt was found to have citrobacter in her urine and C diff in her stool. Pt was then discharged to [**Hospital1 99**] Senior Life where she was in her normal state of health until three days ago. Her son reports that she then developed a headache and fevers started three days ago which were treated with tylenol. Then, this morning she developed fatigue and did not eat well. He son also notes that she appeared to be working hard to breath. She was found to be febrile to 101.9 and received levoflox and vancomycin.

CXR performed on floor, showed some diffuse fluffiness. She received 40 mg IV lasix. She continues to have intermittent nausea and vomiting with 2-3 episodes of emesis since yesterday evening. . n the MICU, she was intubated on [**11-25**] for worsening hypercarbia. That evening she spiked a fever, went into AF vs MAT with HRs into the 160s, and hypotension to the 80s. She did not tolerate beta blockers at that time and was started on an amiodarone gtt. She was also started on empiric vancomycin and zosyn for possible aspiration pna. She received aggressive volume resuscitation and converted to NSR the following morning. Her amiodarone was discontinued given concern for worsening lung and liver disease. Her beta blocker was uptitrated. Antibiotics were briefly discontinued on [**11-27**] and restarted on [**11-28**]. She was eventually diuresed and was able to be extubated on [**11-29**]. She was called out to the medical floor on [**11-30**]. . While on the medical floor, she was continued on vancomycin and zosyn for presumed aspiration pna. She had no microbiology data to help guide therapy. She was continued on diuretics but has run I/O even per documentation. While on floor, SBPOs 100s, HRs 80s, RR 20s, O2 90s on 3LNC. . On the evening of transfer, trigger called for increased work of breathing. Upon floor evaluation, patient denied any subjective SOB. O2 requirement the same at 90s n 3LNC and no significant change in RR. However, at ~ MN, patient went into irregular SVT (AF vs MAT) to 150s, T100.3, with SBPs into 90s, RR increased to 30s, and O2 sats low 90s on 4-6L. She received lopressor 5 mg IV x 2 without significant change in her HR and decrease in SBP to 80s. CXR repeated without significant change compared to this am. ABG showed 7.35/73/54.

The patient was originally admitted to the Vascular Surgery Service and was then transferred three to four days later to the C-MED Service. This is a 73-year old female with coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass grafting and multiple cardiac catheterizations and percutaneous interventions at outside hospitals), peripheral vascular disease, chronic renal insufficiency, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] from an outside hospital to the Vascular Surgery Service with a right lower extremity gangrenous ulceration.  The reason for transfer was for possible vascular intervention. On arrival to the Vascular Surgery Service the patient's INR was elevated as she had been on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation.  She was given two units of fresh frozen plasma to reverse her coagulopathy and developed jaw pain (her anginal equivalent) and went into acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  The patient was nearly intubated but improved with a nitroglycerin drip and Natrecor. She was then transferred to the C-MED Service for further diuresis and because her exercise tolerance test sestamibi obtained following her acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema showed reversible anterior defects as well as partially reversible lateral wall defects.  Her creatine kinase and troponin were flat at the time of the acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  The patient did report some baseline shortness of breath, but felt that it was worse at the time of transfer to C-MED Service.  However, at baseline the patient can only walk 15 feet with a walker and is limited by anginal pain or shortness of breath.  The patient did report paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema in the past - but not currently.  The patient uses 2 liters of oxygen at home.
67yo female with CAD, DMII, ESRD who was initially admitted for SOB on [**2948-10-15**].  Pt complained of increased SOB after dialysis and was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring of respiratory status.  CXR was consistent with CHF and ECG showed signs of mild ST depression in I, aVL and poor R wave progression.  Pt ruled in for NSTEMI with CK peak of 207 and trop peak of 2.22 while in the MICU.  Pt denied CP, palpitations, SOB.
The patient is a 68 year old man with a two week history of increasing shortness of breath admitted to the [**Hospital6 2863**] on [**1-14**] where he ruled in for an myocardial infarction.  The patient with known cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology with known coronary artery disease by MIBI echocardiogram, scheduled for an elective catheterization but had increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion, therefore admitted prior to his cardiac catheterization and ruled in for non-Q wave myocardial infarction.  His catheterization at [**Hospital6 2864**] showed 50% left main, left main 80% left anterior descending, 70% right coronary artery with an ejection fraction of 20%.  The patient was in congestive heart failure at the time.  He was started on Dobutamine with relief of symptoms and was transferred to [**Hospital6 1991**] for coronary artery bypass grafting.  Catheterization done at that time also showed an aortic valvular area of 0.8 cm squared.  He has a history of syncopal episodes. Therefore his catheterization was to be repeated after arrival at [**Hospital6 253**].

ED COURSE: In ER, she was found to be hypotensive to 70s/40s, have a positive UA, lactate 2.1, acute renal failure. She was started on levophed, gentle IVF given CHF, and levo/flagyl. . ROS: No HA, visual changes, hearing changes, trouble speaking, swallowing, numbness/weakness elsewhere, vertigo. No head, neck or back trauma recently. No F/C/NS, no cough, no sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] diarrhea or dysuria.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3261**] is a 68 yo man with a history of severe CAD s/p MI, 3V CABG (LIMA-LAD, SVG-RCA, sequential SVG-D1-OM) in [**3049**] and multiple PCIs who presents with acute onset chest pain. The patient states that he was in his usual state of health when he woke up this morning [**10-9**]. He was in his kitchen when the next thing he knew he woke up on the floor. He denies any prodrome including dizziness, lightheadedness, vertigo, focal weakness, or aura. He does not know how long he was unconscious, but when he awoke he was experiencing acute onset [**10-15**] retrosternal chest pain. The pain was diffuse and located at the midline. It was not positional and was not acutely associated with nausea or vomiting. It did radiate up to his jaw, which alarmed him since this was exactly what he experienced when he had his MI. He does not think he fell on his chest. He was able to get up on his own, climb the stairs, and call EMS. He was brought to [**Hospital3 **] where he was given ASA and nitro SL without relief of his chest pain. He was started on a TNG drip but still complained of [**10-15**] pain. EKG showed ventricularly paced rhythm with no acute ST or QRS changes from prior. A Troponin-I measurment was 0.14. Myoglobin was 103. His INR was 4.3. An ABG on 2L NC at that time was 7.32/46/95/24/Sat 97%. He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible catheterization. On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He is unable to walk very far due to left leg pain, but states this is due to an established neuropathy. All of the other review of systems were negative. Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3265**] is a 76 year old male with chronic diastolic congestive heart failure(aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation) and chronic atrial fibrillation who presented to outside hospital with progressive shortness of breath and chest pain for the last six months. He admits to occasional rest pain as well. During that admission, he was found to be anemic and transfused with several units of PRBC's. Endoscopy found a nonbleeding AV malformation in the proximal duodenum. Given his above cardiac status, he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.
81y/o M with h/o diverticular bleed presented to ED with melena and BRBPR x1 day.  Pt felt lightheaded, but denied CP, palpitations, or dyspnea at rest. + DOE.  Denied N/V.  Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on ED exam.  Hct had dropped from 41.9 in [**5-26**] to 33.7.  NG lavage was performed, which revealed active bleeding that did not clear - 1000cc lavage was performed.  Pt was noted to have ST depressions in V2-V3 and elevated troponin to 0.15.  Pt was transfused 5 units PRBCs. EGD revealed esophageal varices and active bleeding.  Banding was attempted but unsuccessful.  Profuse bleeding was noted during EGD, and pt had episodes of frank hematemesis.  He was therefore intubated and sedated. In the [**Name (NI) **], pt rec'd 6 units PRBC and 5 units FFP (INR 2.9 on presentation).  He also rec'd protonix 40mg IV x1, sandestatin 200mcg IV x1, levofloxacin 500mg IV x1, propofol gtt, succinylcholine/etomidate, vitamin K sc, and octreotide gtt.  He was given a total of 6 units FFP, as well, as well as a bag of platelets, and taken to IR for emergent TIPS. At IR, pt was noted to have small systemic-portal pressure gradient (10mm Hg), with elevated Pra (25mm Hg) and portal pressures of 35mm Hg.  Varices did not fill with injection of dye into the portal vein.  TIPS was not performed.
The patient is a 78 year-old male admitted earlier then anticipated, because of failure to thrive, respiratory difficulties, peripheral edema and pericardial effusion after having been discharged for a prior hospitalization for aspiration pneumonia where he was found to have a collapse of his left main stem bronchus, distal trachea and right main stem bronchus for which he subsequently had a stent placed during that previous visit. He returned on [**5-1**] of [**2882**] earlier then anticipated as mentioned previously for removal of these stents and tracheoplasty and pericardiotomy for intraoperative pericardiotomy for pericardial effusion that he developed. At the time of his admission the patient was afebrile with blood pressure 150/80, pulse 70, respiratory rate 20 and he was sating 95% on room air.  Notably on examination his cardiac examination revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm. The lungs revealed bilateral crackles throughout and there was 1 to 2+ pitting edema most markedly notable in the lower extremities. On admission his electrolytes were all within normal limits with a BUN and creatinine of 18 and 1.0.  His white blood cell count was 4.4.  Hematocrit 37.5 and platelet count was 131.  PT was 13.7, INR 1.2 and PTT was 59.4. The patient was admitted and had his stents removed on [**5-6**]. He subsequently underwent a number of bronchoscopies for clearing of secretions.  He was optimized preoperatively for surgery.  On [**5-8**] he underwent right thoracotomy with posterior membrane tracheoplasty and bilateral bronchoplasties along with pericardial window.  The surgery went smoothly without complications, but due to the patient's size and anatomy the distal portion of the left main stem bronchus could not be corrected, therefore some tracheomalacia remained at that edge.  Initially postoperatively, the patient's course went fairly smoothly. Several days postoperatively the patient developed acute renal failure for which his creatinine jumped to 3.5 and this was found to be partially due to acute tubular necrosis and hypovolemia.  The patient remained in and out of atrial fibrillation throughout the course of his hospitalization. One week postoperatively the patient went into pulmonary congestion and subsequent respiratory arrest at which time he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, but was subsequently extubated with aggressive diuresis and aggressive antimicrobial therapy.  The patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit after his tracheal bronchitis had cleared and he subsequently went back to the floor.  While on the floor the patient developed severe pneumonia, which required him to return to the Intensive Care Unit.  Again with aggressive care and antimicrobial therapy he regained enough strength to return to the floor. After discharge to the floor toward the end of his hospitalization he did well for two weeks.  He did have repeat bronchoscopies, which showed the distal tracheal malacia as previously mentioned, but there was excellent clearance of secretions throughout.  It is anticipated that as his airway edema resolves his clearance will become even more improved.  Of note, late in his hospital course the patient developed recurrent right pleural effusions with some loculations, but the majority of this was cleared with placement of a chest tube. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  On discharge the patient was doing well without shortness of breath and he comfortably cleared secretions without assistance and has an excellent cough. The deconditioning from the hospitalization needs aggressive rehabilitation and he does need to anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation.  While in the hospital he was on Lovenox, but he needs to be converted to Coumadin while in rehab.  He needs to follow up with his cardiologist for further management of this atrial fibrillation.  He should be seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 940**] within two weeks. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1.  Tracheal bronchomalacia, status post posterior membrane tracheoplasty with bilateral bronchoplasty. 2.  Coronary artery disease. 3.  Pericardial effusion. 4.  Diabetes mellitus. 5.  Hypertension. 6.  Atrial fibrillation. 7.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 8.  Sick sinus syndrome. 9.  Recurrent pleural effusions.

76 year old female with h/o hypothyoidism, HTN/HLP, AAA repair in past with notable known lung adenoCA and new RLL lung mass which has enlarged in size over the last 4 months, being followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in oncology, who presented to Dr.[**Name (NI) 3321**] clinic today for follow-up of recent multiple ground glass opacities and recent biopsy of RL lung with c/o progressive night sweats, anorexia, weakness.  Pt is being admitted directly from oncology clinic for further evaluation and inability to care for herself at home secondary to weakness. Notable results from recent biopsy revealed new squamous cell CA (different than prior adenoCA). . Regarding the patient's symptoms - noted last seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] 3wks prior - with progressive symptoms of fatigue, wt loss (10 lb past 6 mo), NS, decreasing BP with PCP down titrating BP meds recently.  Overall symptoms had started [**6-11**] mo ago with rhinorrea, dry cough, ear pain all without fevers - tx with several courses of azithromycin/levofloxacin.  In addition with progressive fatigue - pt with further difficulty ambulating 50m more due to gen decreased strength, no focal symptoms, does have mild DOE without SOB at rest, productive cough/hemopytosis.   Pt with general mild mid-lower back pain without any current CP complaints presently.  Pt denies any current ear pain, HA, or sinus complaints.  Note patient has not taken any of her home medication yet today at time of evaluation. . ROS: Denies skin changes, changes in urination or bowels, otherwise 10-point ROS is negative except as detailed above.
Pt is a 68 yo male with DM, HTN, deep brain stimulator, who is being transferred from the floor from hypotension. Pt says that he has been having fevers off and on for 5 weeks. Max temp reached 104. No weight loss, night sweats with this but pt does endorses rigors/chills. He states that some nights he would have fever and sometimes his temperature would be 98.5 (fevers generally occured at night). Pt did not go to his [**First Name3 (LF) 3340**] until this past Tuesday. Blood cultures were drawn and grew out GPC in clusters and pt was told to come to the ED. In the ED, lactate was 4.7 (attributed to rigors as lactate was lower previously) but patient did not meet strict criteria for sepsis then and was admitted to the floor and started on vancomycin.
The patient is a 55 year-old man with a history of diabetes/end stage renal disease on hemodialysis on the renal transplant list who presents with fever and cough.  The patient was in his usual state of health until the day of admission when he noticed increasing productive cough, increasing shortness of breath and some pleuritic chest pain.  He denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, substernal chest pain, abdominal pain.  He did have some diarrhea, but no melena or hematochezia.  He denies dysuria or hematuria.  Of note the patient also noticed right lower extremity edema for the two days prior to admission.  He reports increasing fatigue.  He denies headache, vision changes, nuchal rigidity.  The patient had a recent admission on [**4-4**] with pneumonia treated with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin and then oral Cefpodoxime on discharge.
Fifty-five year old with male with end-stage renal disease who is hemodialysis dependent, who at dialysis session aborted midway on [**Last Name (LF) 2928**], [**3269-6-28**] because he developed chest pain midway through dialysis. Per his wife, he has had very frequent episodes of chest pain more than 10 during dialysis since he was started on hemodialysis in [**3268-8-2**].  He went to a hospital in [**Hospital1 388**], where he was started on nitrodrip.  His chest pain resolved and has not returned since, and he went home the next day.  His wife noted that the workup for his chest pain has been negative in the past including a cardiac catheterization done in [**3268-9-2**] which showed normal coronary arteries. Since the night prior to admission, he has had cough.  No fevers, no chills.  He missed dialysis today, [**7-1**] because he was sent to the Emergency Department from home shortly before he was scheduled for his 5 pm dialysis.  He denies any changes in his diet or noncompliance with dietary restrictions.  He has been unable to lie flat this past day due to shortness of breath.  This is new compared with his baseline.  He does not complain of shortness of breath at rest currently, and says that he is able to work, but that his exercise tolerance is markedly decreased compared with his baseline.  In the Emergency Department, his oxygen saturation on room air is 80%, so he was begun on a nonrebreather mask.
The patient is a 55 year old male with a history of end state renal disease who was admitted from [**Hospital6 33**] on [**3269-8-17**], with acute shortness of breath, chest pain and hypoxia.  He was saturating 70% on room air, and was put on 100% non-rebreather and was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further management. On arrival to [**Hospital1 69**], oxygen saturation was 40% on 100% non-rebreather.  The patient then went into cardiac and respiratory arrest with ventricular tachycardia.  He underwent defibrillation three times, received amiodarone, and was intubated and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. Potassium was 6.3 on admission, and EKG revealed peaked T waves.  Chest x-ray showed florid pulmonary edema.  He was initially placed on a Nitroglycerin drip, given 4 mg of morphine, one ampule of calcium gluconate, 10 units of insulin intravenously with one ampule of D50 and Lasix 200 mg intravenously. The patient's wife reports that he does not comply with his diet.  His two past episodes of congestive heart failure have been secondary to dietary noncompliance and difficulty adhering to his fluid restriction. In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had troponin peaking at 0.16, which was attributed to recent cardiac defibrillation. The Renal Service got involved and dialyzed about two to three liters off on [**8-19**].  The patient spiked a fever to 101.0 F., on [**8-19**], with a urinalysis with six to ten white blood cells and moderate bacteria.  Zosyn was started. A chest x-ray was questionable for aspiration pneumonia. During his Medical Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient was transiently on Dopamine which was attributed to sedation and hypotension with propofol.  The patient self-extubated himself on [**8-20**] and has been stable from the hemodynamic and respiratory standpoint.
76 year old female with h/o hypothyoidism, HTN/HLP, AAA repair in past with notable known lung adenoCA and new RLL lung mass which has enlarged in size over the last 4 months, being followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in oncology, was discharged yesterday after admission for bronchoscopy, c/b pneumothorax for which a pigtail was placed (removed at time of discharge).

The patient is a 76 year old primarily-Cantonese speaking man with vascular risk factors who was in his usual state of health until 8:30pm this evening.  At that time, while watching TV he felt generally weak and unwell.  He asked his wife to help his to the bathroom; he was too ??????weak?????? to make it there, and had an episode of urinary incontinence  He then had the sensation of bilateral arm (particularly shoulder) weakness and heaviness. This sensation abated, and the patient noted R arm weakness; his wife called EMS. On arrival, EMS found FSG 161, BP 175/82, and an irregularly irregular pulse.  They felt that the patient had R facial droop and R arm weakness.  While in the ambulance, he was thought to develop dysarthria.  He was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED and a stroke code was activated at 10:00pm. The Neurology resident was at the bedside within minutes.  She gave the patient an NIHSS of 3 (1 point each for R facial droop, R pronator drift, and RUE dysmetria.)  She also felt that the patient had a L tongue deviation.  The patient??????s wife clarified that speech was at baseline (i.e. not newly dysarthric.)  EKG revealed atrial fibrillation.  SBP was noted to be 190 and the patient received 10mg IV labetolol.

He was transferred to the CCU team for further management of his hypotension and ARF
60 year-old male with history significant for severe nonischemic hypertensive cardiomyopathy (EF 20%), ICD placement,diabetes who presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting since the morning of admission. The patient states he ate breakfast at 9 am, and approximately one hour later, the pain began and continued to wax and wane throughout the day, often reaching [**9-14**]. The pain was described as bandlike across his abdomen, without radiation to the back. No aggravating factors other than eating. The pain was alleviated with Morphine in the ED. The patient has never had this type of pain in the past. The patient also complained of nausea and vomiting, nonbilious/nonbloody. The patient denied diarrhea, melena or hematochezia. He denies any recent changes in his medications, recent travel, recent alcohol use, history of gallstones or symptoms of biliary colic. . In the ED, the patient received one liter NS, morphine, and a dose of levofloxacin. The patient was admitted to the MICU. . In the MICU he was given NS at 150cc/hr. Antibiotics were not continued. The biliary team saw the patient and recommended ERCP. The procedure was deferred due to the patient's INR. The patient's pain was improved on transfer.
HPI: The patient is a 61 year old man with severe systolic CHF (EF 15-20%), HTN, DM2 who presents with rectal pain. He states that he has had 5 years of intermittent rectal pain following a colonscopy that diagnosed internal hemorrhoids. He states that 5 days ago he had worsened rectal pain that was worsened with bowel movements. He has seen small amounts of blood in his stool over this time. He was seen by his PCP 2 days ago who prescribed anusol. His pain progressed and was referred to the ED yesterday by his PCP. . In the ED his initial vitals were 98.8 85 144/83 18 94%RA. A rectal exam showed L glutteal area/perirectal area +erythema, tender, fluctuant, +pus; L rectal wall tender. A CT pelvis showed a large peri-rectal abscess. I&D was done. General Surgery was consulted who recommended conservative therapy as the lesion was already draining. His ED course was complicated by hypotension with a nadir sbp to 73/50. He did receive single doses of diluadid and morphine for rectal pain ~1 hour prior to hypotension starting. Sepsis protocol was started. He received vanc/unasyn. A RIJ was placed. He received a total of 1.5 liters of crystalloid. Blood, urine, swab cultures were taken. Initial lactate was 2.4 with repeat 1.2. . ROS at admission: denies cough, chest pain, abd pain. breathing is at baseline. mild dysuria since rectal pain started. . In the MICU, pt's pressures stabilized s/p IVF and 1 unit RBCs. His Hct stabilized at 28 and nadir at 23 believed to be [**1-8**] abscess drainage. He was continued on vancomycin and unasyn for likely MRSA/MSSA, cultures pending.  Blood cultures remained negative.  Pt also c/o new L knee pain c/w gouty pain.  NSAIDs held given CKD and recent decr Hct, he is taking colchicine.
61y/o M w/ DM2, CHF s/p ICD, CRI, and atrial fibrillation presenting today with altered mental status and hypotension. The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in mid-[**Month (only) 1082**] with a perirectal abscess complicated by hypotension and a MICU admission. His course was further complicated by renal failure and a transaminitis attributed to unasyn therapy. He was discharged to a rehab facility on [**11-18**] and had recently left that facility and returned home last week. According to his wife, he has been more sedated since discharge from the hospital but otherwise has been doing relatively well at home. He endorses chronic knee and LE pain but denies any recent CP, SOB, abdominal pain, N/V, poor PO intake, progressive weakness, paresthesias, HA, melena, or BRBPR. He has noticed some intermittant painless shaking in his hands that has occasionally caused him to drop objects. He and his wife note good compliance with his medications though she had held his coreg until yesterday given slow HR at home. She feels that his altered mental status can be directly attributed to the doses of narcotics that he was discharge on as this was a new medication for him. He has been eating well at home but did not take good PO today despite receiving his regular dose of insulin. . Today he presented to a neurology appointment for further evaluation of his hand shaking and there was noted to be somnolent. His blood pressure was in the 80s systolic and he was sent to the ED for further evaluation. There he was seen to be bradycardic to the low 50s and somnolent. His glucose level was 33 and he received D50 and promptly awoke and was appropriate per report. His bradycardia was treated with atropine to which his HR increased to the 70s and his relative hypotension (systolic ~90) improved. EP was contact[**Name (NI) **] and reportedly felt that no intervention was indicated at this time. He was admitted to the ICU because his HR dipped to the low 50s for ~25 seconds and it was felt that he merited intensive monitoring.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3467**] is a 63yo M w/hx of CHF (EF 15-20%), s/p ICD placement, severe TR, DM2, CKD (baseline Cr 1.3-1.8), afib on coumadin, elevated LFTs, who presented to the ED with chest pain and L arm pain. By report of wife and patient he has had bad gout over the past several weeks to months.  Principally this has been involving his right foot limiting his ability to walk. In the past few days had increasing right arm pain that patient thought was also his gout.  Then starting about yesterday, patient had severe left arm pain at the shoulder and the elbow. This is ultimately what prompted him to come to the ED.  ROS notable for +sharp midsternal chest pain with coughing, non-productive cough, sinus congestion for several weeks, chills.  Patient denied back pain, neck pain, pain with chewing, changes to his urine output or other complaints beyond those noted. . Of note, recent medication changes include uptitration of allopurinol to 250mg PO qday for gout after recent gout flare [**2-13**]. . In the ED, initial vs were: T101.4 HR71 BP90/42 RR20 100%RA . Blood pressures dropped to the 70s systolic and he was given 1L IVF, a CVL was placed and CVP was 13-16.  A R IJ was placed and after dopamine was turned up to 20mcg/min, he was started on Levofed and dopamine was weaned down.  He was given Vanc and Levofloxacin and nothing further due to allergy to Unasyn.  He underwent non-contrast CT of the abdomen which was grossly normal. CXR was clear.  A FAST scan in the ED did not show pericardial effusion, kidneys without hydronephrosis.  Received 3L NS, ASA 325, Vanco 1gram Morphine 4mg IV x1.  Levo/aztreonam ordered but not given. . On arrival to the floor, patient c/o total body pain, and feeling cold.

For hypotension pt rec'd 500cc over 2 hrs, then approx 100 cc/hr, givne low EF and worsening renal fxn. . On arrival to the floor and when seen in ED, patient is lethargic. VS improved VS on transfer 80, 87/55, 22, 100% on 4L. Pt wife and pt, he denies belly pain but does have nausea and vomitting in addition to diarrhea. Pt reports SOB as well. Less LE edema per wife. Possible fever. Blood cultures were drawn at rehab but pt's wife was not told what they were treating w/abx. . REVIEW OF SYSTEMS On review of systems, has some sputum but minimal cough, possible fevers but chills or rigors. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, but does have SOB, some orthopnea, and ankle edema. .
[**Age over 90 **] yo male with h/o Parkinson's dz, spinal compression fractures and recent admission at [**Hospital1 **] from [**Date range (1) 3501**] for PNA who presents from an OSH with PNA and stable hypoxia. On [**10-2**] he was admitted to OSH with worsening SOB. His sats were 89- 91% on a NRB and he was noted to be somnolent and in severe respiratory distress. ABG was 7.30/60/88/29. CXR showed LLL infiltrate and wbc was 11.9. He was intubated and treated for suspected PNA with zosyn and vancomycin at the OSH.  He was ultimately transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] for continued care per request of the patient's wife. . In the MICU, pt was continued on unasyn to complete 10 day course of antibiotics for his aspiration pneumonia. He was witnessed to aspirate repeatedly leading to changes in mental status and worsening hypoxia. This prompted the placement of a G-tube by GI on [**10-11**]. On [**10-12**], tube feeds were started per nutrition recs. Pt's respiratory status remained tenuous but stable and improved slowly every day. For decreased urine output, he received several IVF boluses. He was then transferred to the medical [**Hospital1 **].
As per MICU admission note, patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with h/o parkinsons and 3 prior admissions with aspiration pneumonia, requiring intubation on episode in [**9-6**], s/p [**Date Range 278**] placement, who presents from his NH with decreased oxygen saturation and altered mental status. History is obtained per NH/hospital records. Per the patient's wife, the Pt desatted to 82% 2 nights PTA, returning to normal in the AM prior to admission. Pt subsequently desatted later in the day. Pt was placed on 02 by RT with good effect. [**Name (NI) 1080**] wife also reported low grade fevers to about 99.7 (baseline 97.0). Per the NH notes, the patient has not had a cough, but has been productive of thick clear sputum. In addition, he has also been more somnolent than normal, speaking less than usual. Of note, the patient's wife reported that though the most recent speech and swallow evaluation recomended nectar thickened liquids and ground solids, he has been eating a regular diet. . In the ED the patient's vital signs were: T:99.4 HR:68 BP:161/83 RR:24 SaO2:100% on 3L. CXR showed LLL infiltrate and UA was positive. The patient was given 1G Vanco, 500mg Levoflox, 500mg flagyl, sinemet x2, mirapex x1, and comptan x1. . Within an hour after arrival to the floor, the patient was noted to be somnolent and tired, not responding to commands and appearing lethargic. ABG was performed, showing a pH 7.22, pCO2 104, pO2 146, HCO3 42. Given concerns for his hypercarbic respiratory failure, the patient was transferred to the MICU for urgent intubation. . While in the MICU the patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and was been given vancomycin/zosyn to cover both aspiration pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Mild hypotension with sedation. . ROS: Done on admission: "Per patient's wife, + SOB, weakness, constipation. - f/c, wt change, visual/hearing changes, HA, n/v, dysphagia, CP, abd pain, dysuria."
62 yo F with h/o, HTN, hypertensive heart disease, who presents with two days of fever, nausea, vomiting and mental status changes.  Patient is confused and has poor insight into her recent symptoms and reasons for presentation to the hospital. "I felt like I had a cold... my son brought me in, you should talk to him." The following was obtained from discussions with family and EMS. Over the last 4 days, patient has become increasingly confused. She also has had fever, vomiting, and diarrhea over last 2 days. She lives at home, with her son who called EMS and she was brought in by ambulance. On presentation to the ED, VS were T 99.1, HR 106, BP 127/78, SpO2 98% on 2L. Labs were significant for WBC count of 17, K of 2.9 and ALT/AST of 185/225. CXR demonstrated L hilar opacity suspicious for PNA. Head CT showed no acute bleed. EKG showed sinus tachycardia with lateral ST depressions. She was given 2L NS, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, IV and PO potassium, ibuprofen and tylenol. She was admitted to the medicine service for further management of PNA and transaminitis. On transfer VS were T 99.1, HR 101, BP 102/57, RR 17, SpO2 95/4L (89 on RA) ROS: Denies night sweats, vision changes, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.
This is a 86 y/o male with a h/o CAD, CHF (EF 30-40%), HTN, MDS, recent admission in [**7-13**] for diarrhea and treated presumptively for c diff given his past history of c diff enterocolitis, who now presents to the ED with n/v/weakness/dehydration/diarrhea/epigastric abd pain x 24 hours. Pt also had one episode of emesis (no blood) yesterday. He is still on his course of flagyl from recent admission, but has missed the last few doses due to outpt pharmacy issues. . In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to have an elevated lipase and amylase of 557 and 900, respectively. He was also noted to have an elevated lactate of 3.2 and a positive u/a with 6-10 wbc's, trace leuks, neg nitrates. He was initially to be admitted to medicine, however pt dropped his SBP from 110 to 90, asymptomatic. Received 500 cc with good response and current SBP in the 100's. Received a total of 1 L NS. He was given Vanc/CTX/flagyl in the ED for h/o MRSA, positive u/a, and recent h/o c diff enterocolitis ([**4-14**]). . Currently, through aid of daughter translating, pt denies any f/c/s, dizziness/lightheadedness, chest pain, SOB, palpitations, n/v, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms. +generalized weakness, but not much different from baseline. +diarrhea, no BRBPR/hematochezia/melena. . The patient was transferred to the medicine service [**3172-7-10**]. His diarrhea was improving and he had no complaints at that time.
59 year old gentleman with a past medical history of CAD s/p CABG in [**3105**] with LIMA to LAD and RIMA to RCA, hyperlipidemia, htn, and smoking. The patient was having symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pain, unclear for how long and decided to go to his PCP who he had not seen in over two years. On route to the office, his symptoms worsened and he called his doctor who advised him to pull over and call 911. Taken by Ambulance to [**Hospital1 **] ER at 1130. There he received 325 aspirin, 4 morphine and nitroglycerin drip. Arixtra (Fondiparinux) was also given. EKG revealed ST depressions in leads I, aVL, V3-V6. ST elevation in AVR. CK 99, MB and troponin unknown. The patient had worsened dyspnea and hypoxia, had pulmonary edema on CXR and was electively intubated (etomidate, succinylcholine). Integrilin started and sent for catheterization. Left heart cath via right femoral artery reportedly with 95% lm occlusion, native RCA and LAD are both occluded. LIMA and RIMA appeared patent. . Pt received 40 IV lasix and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further intervention. Became hypotensive to SBP 70-80 and was placed on neo gtt on route. On arrival to cath lab pt still pressor dependent. Cath revealed critical >95 percent stenosis at L main near junction of LCx and ramus. Bare metal stent placed. SBP improved after placement of this stent and pt weaned off pressor. . Also of note, pt had traumatic intubation. In addition, at first Foley could not be placed--abd was getting distended. Foley placed by urology after dilation of ureteral meatus (had some meatal stenosis). Pt currently intubated and sedated, unable to provide history and does open eyes and seems to respond to voice.

He experienced fatigue after working outside in hot weather, and later that day, was noted to have a fever to 104. He went to [**Hospital **] Hosp where he was febrile to 104. He was given levofloxacin and IVFs and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he was admitted to the ICU for sepsis. . He denies current f/c/sweats. He denies cp/sob/cough. He denies n/v/abd pain. He denies dysuria. He denies URI sx/sore throat/myalgias. He denies LAD/swelling/rash. .
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 1375**] was having anterior quads symptoms and leg symptoms that were on top of her acute chronic back pain.  She is currently on MS Contin and Neurontin.  She is [**9-6**] at rest, [**10-6**] with activity.  However, she is almost 90% back pain and this is what stops her and not leg pain.  She has had significant benefit from mild ablation in her back previously. Her thigh pain has certainly settled down on the Neurontin.
54yo woman presented to the ED with 2 days of fevers, cough, and muscle aches.  Also had right sided sharp, stabbing [**10-2**] pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath, exacerbated by cough or inspiration.  No anginal symptoms.  In ED, received ceftriaxone, azithromycin, as well as aspirin.  Initial SBP in the 80's, and received 3L NS and started on levophed gtt; bp went up to 101/44. On further review and consultation with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was noted that her BP normally runs low in the 80-90's Systolic.
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is 58 year old female with history of COPD, Systolic CHF (EF 45-50%), Bipolar disease, Borderline Personality Disorder, severe pain, depression, RA, and oxygen use (4L without a clear-cut rationale).  She was admitted today for chest pain and dyspnea. . Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] reports that she had the flu last week and began experiencing diffuse chest pain (10+/10), a non-productive cough, fatigue, and pain-associated dyspnea over the weekend that differed in quality from her normal angina.  The pain intensitifed when she would breath deeply or cough and she had a reported fever of 102.0, and she denied chills/sweats as well as any radiating pain to her neck or arms.  Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] did not take her usual nitroglycerin, but instead called Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 569**], her pulmonologist who directed her to get a CXR at the ED.  Medical records indicate that she described her chest pain to EMT as left-sided, stabbing, associated with pressure and dyspnea -- similiar to her normal angina-like symptoms.  Ms. [**Known patient lastname **], however, disputes this characterization (along with receiving any pain medications en-route or in the ED. . Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] also reports a worsening of her chronic diarhrea since [**Last Name (LF) 2928**], [**12-24**].  She also reports that some blood in her diarrhea since that time, but denies any change in her PO intake, reporting that she had a proper dinner last night. . In the ED, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 3675**] vitals were BP: 115/63 & 102/53, HR: 107 & 90, RR: 16 & 20, O2 Sat: 100% 5L NC & 94% on 3L NC.  She was also afebrile.  In the ED she received ASA (325 mg), Nitroglycerin, Kcl (40mEq), Percocet (5/325), morphine (2mg IV), and Levofloxacin (750mg).  She denied any abdominal pain and refused a guaiac exam.  On physical exam, no wheezing.  A CXR identified multifocal bilateral airspace opacities and blunting of the left costophrenic angle -- consistent with multifocal pneumonia and a small parapneumonic effusion.  Her EKG was reassuring, and her cardiac enzymes (CK: 21) were negative. She also had no events on telemetry and was reportedly chest pain free before being transfered to [**Doctor Last Name **]. . After being transferred to [**Doctor Last Name **], she complained of chest pain and dyspnea, abdominal pain, and pain in the balls of her feet. She also refused rectal guiac as well as an ABG.  A second CXR indicated that her cardiac sillihette was stable, that she had multifocal pneumonia with multifocal hazy opacities in her RUL, RML, and LLL as well as a blunted left costrophrenic angle.
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 60-year-old female with past medical history significant for Bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, multiple suicide attempts, h/o alcoholism, PTSD, COPD on home O2, breast cancer s/p lumpectomy who presented to ED via EMS after being found disoriented and wandering around her housing complex barefoot with 1 empty and 1 full bottle of clonazepam. She had 1 empty bottle of clonazepam filled [**6-19**] with 0 tablets and a 2nd bottle of clonazepam filled with 39 pills (filled yesterday, so 21 tablets gone). She is supposed to be taking up to 4 pills per day per [**Month/Year (2) **]. Patient states on further history that she dropped "a bunch" of her clonazepam tablets fell on the floor. She repeatedly denies any overdose. She was initially very agitated and unable to give detailed history. She also c/o pain all over her body pain and was slightly tremulous at rest. Per patient, she also complained of having recently run out of her home 02 a "few days ago" which she takes for history of COPD. In the ED, initial vital signs were: T 100.1, HR 83, BP 116/86, RR 20 and O2 sat 99% 2L . She denied fevers, cough, dysuria or abdominal pains on ROS in ED. She was a limited historian however, and difficult as she refused FSG and refused attempt at LP. Despite negative ETOH level she claims she has been drinking a bottle of wine daily but also made several confusing statements about timeline of her ETOH use so it is unclear if she actively using alcohol now. CT head and CXR in ED were both negative. EKG also showed normal intervals, NSR with no concerning ST changes. While in ED, she received 1.5L NS IVFs. 2mg Ativan, 5mg Haldol and 50mg Benadryl for agitation which slowly improved through the afternoon. She was also given 1x dose 2g Ceftriaxone to cover possible urinary source and meningitis per ED resident although given no headaches and normal neuro exam there was limited concern for meningitis as her AMS improved in the ED. Given notice of recent TSH of 50 that has been untreated an endocrinology consult was also called from [**Location **] and patient was given 200mcg IV levothyroxine. Per report, endocrinology service did not feel she was in overt myxedema coma but felt her metabolism of recent drugs likely impaired given her severe hypothyroidism. On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 152**], initial vital signs were: T 99.3F, BP 107/58, HR 77, RR 22 and O2 sat 98% on 2L NC. She seemed mildly confused and very easily agitated and refused to answer multiple questions. In no apparent distress.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 1942**] is a 68-year-old white male with a history of CAD status post three vessel CABG, EF less than 20%, mild COPD, hypertension, history of head and neck cancer, history of Hodgkin's disease, status post resection in [**3033**], in remission, who presents with left sided chest pain, worsening dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath and cough.  Roughly two months ago the patient was still able to walk about one mile without problems, however, in the last month he has started to notice increasing fatigue and dyspnea on exertion.  Three weeks ago he began coughing with fevers up to 101 and mild chills intermittently.  In the last two weeks he has also noted increased sneezing and severe non productive cough.  Two days ago he developed [**3047-2-4**] constant stabbing chest pain under the left breast, pleuritic in nature, worse with cough and unresponsive to Nitroglycerin.  It was also worse with walking.  His episodes of pain occur approximately one hour at a time and he does experience shortness of breath but no nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis or radiation.  The patient denies headaches, neck stiffness, sore throat, abdominal pain, myalgias, arthralgias and dysuria.  He has never been intubated.  He does not have a history of pneumonia.  In the Emergency Room he was tachypneic into the 30's, initially satting 77%.  He was then placed on a partial non rebreather mask at 15 liters and was noted to sat in the low 90's.  He was given 40 mg of IV Lasix and diuresed about 150 cc of urine.  Chest x-ray obtained in the AW showed mild failure and a retrocardiac opacity.  He received 325 mg of Aspirin.  Blood cultures times two were obtained and he was given one dose of Levofloxacin.  His initial ABG was as follows:  7.49/32/38. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs, temperature 103.0 (rectal), pulse 109, blood pressure 98/44, respiratory rate 26, O2 saturation 96% on 15 liters partial non rebreather mask.  General, alert and oriented times three, pleasant, in mild respiratory distress with face mask on but talking in full sentences.  HEENT: Pupils were equal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, oropharynx was dry.  There is fullness of the neck but no lymphadenopathy.  Heart, normal S1 and normal S2, no S3, no murmurs or rubs.  PMI non displaced.  Lungs, bronchial breath sounds bibasilarly left greater than right.  No rales. Abdominal, obese, soft, nontender, non distended, normoactive bowel sounds, no CVA tenderness.  Extremities, 1+ DP and PT pulses bilaterally, trace bilateral pitting edema up to the knees. LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 21.5, hematocrit 41.2, platelet count 311,000, neutrophils 92%, bands 7%, lymphs 0%, basos 1%, sodium 137, potassium 4.5, chloride 100, CO2 20, BUN 33, creatinine 1.7, glucose 100.  PT 20.7, PTT 41.5, INR 2.8.  Urinalysis, yellow, clear, specific gravity 1.014, no nitrites, no red blood cells, no white blood cells, no bacteria, no yeast.  Chest x-ray #1 perihilar edema bilaterally, #2 left retrocardiac opacity, effusion vs infiltrate.  EKG, sinus tachycardia with rate 108, normal axis, normal intervals, no acute ST-T wave abnormalities. PROBLEM LIST: 1.  Possible pneumonia. 2.  Possible CHF exacerbation. 3.  Increased creatinine. 4.  Chest pain. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the MICU on a partial 15 liters of oxygen flowing through partial non rebreather mask.  His oxygen saturations were in the mid to high 90's on this and his tachypnea began resolving quickly. The patient was ruled out for an MI by cardiac enzymes and serial EKG's and he was started on 500 mg IV q d of Levofloxacin.  His blood pressure in the MICU was initially 80/40 and there was concern that central access would need to be placed to evaluate the etiology of his hypotension. However, his blood pressure responded well to normal saline boluses of 250 cc each.  He did not experience further hypotension for the rest of his admission.    All of his home medications were continued except for Carvedilol which was held as we were concerned for possible CHF exacerbation.  On day #2 of his admission he began to diurese well on his home regimen of Lasix and his oxygen requirement was quickly weaned from 15 liters partial non rebreather mask to 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen.  On day #2 of his admission the blood cultures came back 4/4 bottles positive for pneumococcus which was pansensitive.  Theory then to explain
This is a 68 year old male with a history of congestive heart failure and an ejection fraction of 30 to 40%, status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft, likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a [**3038-6-3**] admission for pansensitive Streptococcus pneumococcal pneumonia who presented yesterday with shortness of breath for two days, a cough productive of white sputum, chills, and increased dyspnea on exertion.  The patient was in his usual state of health, able to walk ?????? mile before becoming winded until three to four days ago when he developed rhinorrhea and congestion.  Then one day later he developed shortness of breath, cough, chills and increased dyspnea on exertion.  He also commenced sharp, substernal nonradiating chest pain which he rated 4 out of 10 in intensity.  This pain was relieved with rest and worsened with cough.  He did have one episode of dry heaves.  He denied green or yellow sputum, hemoptysis or fevers.  Of note, the patient has had poor dietary compliance of late, eating a large Chinese food dinner three to four nights prior to arrival.  He does deny paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and new orthopnea, although at baseline he sleeps on four pillows.  He does note one day of bilateral lower extremity edema.  He has had good urine output by report and no changes in medicine. PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease; 2.

The following discharge summary will cover the time period from [**10-2**] through [**3461-10-15**]. Please see previous discharge summary for information on patient's admission diagnosis and medications. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1.  Gastrointestinal.  On [**10-3**] the patient developed nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.  Because of this she was not discharged to rehabilitation at [**Location (un) 505**] Center Hospital as had been previously planned.  Due to her symptoms a CT scan was obtained which revealed the patient had an ileus. There were no abscesses or other processes that could be identified.  The neurology service was consulted regarding possibility of this ileus being related to the patient's myopathy but felt this was unlikely since skeletal muscle myopathies typically do not also involve smooth muscle of the Gastrointestinal tract.  A Gastrointestinal consult was obtained who had no additional thoughts on what could be causing the patient's ileus and recommended bowel rest. The patient was kept off tube feeds for two days after which time they were restarted at a low rate of 20 cc's an hour as compared to her goal rate of 65 cc's per hour.  The patient appeared to tolerate this reasonably well and the tube feeds were increased.  When they reached the rate of 30 cc's an hour however the patient developed nausea and vomiting a second time.  Tube feeds were again stopped and her bowel was rested for several days. On [**10-11**] it was decided that because the patient was unable to tolerate tube feeds at a reasonable rate she would be started on TPN for nutrition.  At the time of this dictation on [**10-14**] the patient was reporting decreased abdominal pain and no further nausea or vomiting.  She additionally had been successful in moving her bowels and treated with Colace, Senokot and Fleet enemas.  The suspicion of the team at this point in time is that her ileus is resolving however, very slowly.  Her tube feeds will need to be started at a very slow rate, advanced extremely gently as tolerated with caution being taken because when the rate is increased to abruptly she does tend to develop nausea and vomiting.  She will be discharged out on no tube feeds, they can be started when she arrives at [**Location (un) 505**] Center for rehabilitation. She will be discharged out on TPN which she can continue. Additionally we will maintain her on [**Doctor Last Name **] and Colace. 2.  Pulmonary.  The patient continued to do well on a trach mask and in fact tolerated trach mask ventilation for five days in a row with no support from mechanical ventilator. Because of this she was deemed safe to go to the floor something which the team and the patient's family were very happy with as it was thought this could be a trial preliminary to transferring her to rehabilitation home.  On [**10-8**] she was transferred to the floor. Unfortunately however, on [**10-9**] she was found to be hypoxic to the low 80's on the floor.  She was suctioned with thick tenacious dark secretions came out, her O2 sats increased to the mid-80's. Chest x-ray was consistent with a left sided opacity throughout which was new.  She was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit with ventilatory support and bronchoscopy was performed which revealed purulent drainage from the left mainstem, sample was sent.  Chest x-ray after bronchoscopy revealed markedly improved air space.  O2 saturations increased to 98% on only .4 FIO2.  Following this episode the patient was rested in IMV for several days.  At the time of this admission she was feeling better and feeling strong enough to try pressor support ventilation again. The teams thinking is that perhaps the patient needs to be rested each night in an MV mode letting her use only a trach mask for five days may have been to much to soon and in the future we will get her to tolerate pressor support and rest her on the night and possibly during the day allowing her to breath through the trach mask.  Currently she is being weaned, this will need to be continued at [**Hospital1 **]. Per discussion with the family the pulmonary attending is planning to call the pulmonary attending at [**Hospital1 **] to communicate the patient's need regarding ventilatory management. 3.  Infectious disease.  On [**10-3**] the patient's urine grew out Enterobacter which was sensitive only to Mirpenum and one other [**Doctor Last Name 355**].  She was treated with Mirpenum for seven days. At approximate completion of the 7 days course the patient's BAL sample from her bronch grew out pseudomonas which was resistant to Mirpenum.

The patient is an 84M with prostate CA, CAD, HTN who presents with 2 weeks dry cough.

On admission, the patient is an 86[**Hospital 4557**] nursing home resident who reports recent fevers and coughs productive of white sputum as well as right sided chest pain.  She developed dyspnea saying that her breathing is all right.  She denied chest pain and abdominal pain.  At her nursing home, she was diagnosed with pneumonia, was given Zithromax on [**8-5**], initially 500 per day, then 250 mg thereafter.  Yesterday she continued to spike fevers.  She was given ceftriaxone 1 gm.  Her fevers curtailed throughout the day.  Her blood pressure was recorded to be 84/40 and was transferred to [**Hospital6 253**] for further evaluation.  At [**Hospital3 **], she was given fluid to support her blood pressure.  Her cultures were drawn and was given levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed pneumonia.  The Medical Intensive Care Unit was called to evaluate the patient for low blood pressure and after 4 liters of fluid, her blood pressures did not significantly improve.
This is a 79-year-old white female with coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction with coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2525**], myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure in [**2535-8-23**], with diabetes, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, status post left above-knee amputation in [**2530**], who complained of an eight-month history of right forefoot ulceration.  In spite of treatment, the patient's left fifth toe ulceration has not healed. Over the previous week prior to admission, the patient noted changes in the color of her right toes.  She denied rest pain.  She complained of prior symptoms of right lower extremity claudication, although currently she is wheelchair bound.  She has a left lower extremity prosthesis, which she does not use. The patient was seen in the office a week prior to admission and scheduled for admission and elective revascularization of her right leg.
The patient is a 70-year-old gentleman with a long history of end-stage renal disease secondary to polycystic kidney disease. He also had polycystic liver disease that was complicated by an infected cyst involving the liver that ruptured into the pericardium necessitating a prolonged hospitalization. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**3030-8-25**], with congestive heart failure. He underwent further evaluation and was found to have a pericardial tamponade secondary to a rupture of infected hepatic cyst into his pericardium. He had a pericardial window done in the past with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4603**] [**Doctor Last Name **] and abdominal incision at that point in time we removed the lateral segment of the liver to include the cyst. His postoperative course from that episode was long and prolonged and he eventually was able to recover, but he presented on [**3030-8-28**] with sepsis. A tube was placed into his pericardium and fluid demonstrated high white count consistent with pericarditis. He was taken to the operating room on [**8-28**], where he underwent a pericardial window. Despite this, he continued to remain septic with pressor requirements and acidosis. At that point in time, we were concerned that he, in fact, had a visceral perforation that had contaminated the communication between his pericardium and his abdominal cavity and he was taken emergently to the operating room on [**3030-8-30**], where he was found to have a perforation of the sigmoid colon. He underwent sigmoid colectomy and colostomy with a long Hartmann pouch at that point in time. He developed bilateral DVTs and a filter was placed on [**9-4**]. Despite this, he continued to have  problems with multisystem organ failure with hyperbilirubinemia, elevated white count. He underwent a number of CT scans that demonstrated no intra- abdominal fluid collections, but findings suspicious for a bilious/postoperative bowel obstruction. He underwent exploratory laparotomy on [**3031-9-14**], that did not demonstrate any intra-abdominal complications. There was no evidence of bowel obstruction. On [**3030-9-17**], he underwent a tracheostomy for prolonged mechanical ventilation. Over the next 72 hours, his condition deteriorated and on [**3030-9-19**], he expired.

The patient is an 88 year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft times two, congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 35%, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation status post DDD pacer placement, admitted [**3338-10-23**] with sudden onset of right eye pain at home.  She subsequently developed slurred speech and was taken to the Emergency Department via EMS.  In the Emergency Department the patient was noted to have slurred speech and a left hemiparesis.  CAT scan was negative for hemorrhage, but positive for a probable embolic right MCA stroke.  TPA was administered in the Emergency Department without benefit. The patient developed respiratory distress in the Emergency Department requiring supplemental oxygen, Lasix and a trial of a noninvasive ventilator. The patient was subsequently transferred to the MICU.  Blood pressure was elevated on admission to 160 to 180.  Symptoms of congestive heart failure were controlled with a nitroglycerin drip initially.  Neurological examination revealed complete left sided hemiplegia with decreased sensation of the left arm and a left facial droop.  The patient has required no further diuresis in the MICU.  Blood pressures were running in the 120s to 130s.  Nitroglycerin drip was discontinued on [**3338-10-23**] upon arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Speech and swallow evaluation on [**3338-10-24**] recommended nectar thick liquids since the patient was considered to be at aspiration risk.  A repeat head CT on [**10-23**] showed a large right MCA stroke unchanged from prior. The patient's creatinine was slightly increased from baseline, but her urine output was good.  An increased white blood cell count was noted on [**10-23**] considered to be stress response versus evidence of infection and cultures were sent. On [**10-23**] and [**10-24**] the patient was noted to have increased alertness complaining of a headache with an unchanged neurological examination.  On [**10-24**] systolic blood pressure was running 100 to 110 with the head of the bed at 30 degrees elevation.  The patient was alert and interactive though not opening her eyes.  She was subsequently transferred to the floor.
72F with history of rheumatoid arthritis on steroids presents with severe abdominal pain of one day duration.

She has normal bowel movements and reports a normal recent colonoscopy. She denies fevers, chills, and malaise. Her main health problems at this time are related to her RA which is severe and has recently required citoxan therapy for which a tunneled L SCV line was placed about 6 weeks ago. Her last dose of citoxan was 5 weeks ago. She was recently admitted at [**Hospital3 **] for management of MRSA cellulitis from her chronic vasculitic LE leg wounds. At outside hospital, received meropenem and flagyl. Of note, her plavix has been held for the last 4 days.
This patient is an 85 year old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease s/p myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, hypertension who presents with chronit unremitting right lower extremity rest pain and a non-healing right toe ulcer. The patient received an extensive coronary work-up prior to presentation and was felt to be a poor operative candidate given his other co-morbidities. This poor candidate status was discussed at length with the patient and his family, who remained quite insistent that, despite the high risks, we procede with a limb-saving intervention
[**Age over 90 **] yo M w/ multiple medical problems (see below) who presents from [**Hospital 99**] Rehab hypoxic and febrile with CP and bilat infiltrates requiring intubation in the ED.

She received morphine, lovenox, plavix and aspirin and it was decided that she should be transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath. She developed scapular pain, along with an oxygen requirement and had a widened pulse pressure, so there was concern for aortic dissection. Upon transfer she went for CTA to rule out aortic dissection, which showed some evidence of LLL consolidation, and was given 1 dose vanc/cefepime empirically. She was also found to have ST elevations on EKG in leads III and AVF and went to the cath lab for evaluation. Of note, she has been off of her aspirin and plavix due to recent carpal tunnel release on [**2943-10-31**]. . In the cath lab, 100% occlusion of the PDA was seen and 2 BMS were placed in the vein graft in the PDA. The last hour of the procedure, pt was complaining of lower back pain (chronic) and was in a lot of discomfort.

He had seen his cardiologist on the day of admission for this complaint and his cardiologist advised him to go to the hospital for evaluation because he felt his exam at the time was consistent with ischemia vs. cellulitis. Given both his history of DM type II and CAD/PVD, the patient was admitted for IV antibiotics and further workup of his R toe pain.
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old Russian male with a history of gastric and prostate cancer, anemia and esophagitis who was transferred from the nursing home to the MICU with a gastrointestinal bleed, fungemia and bacteremia.  He had a very complicated medical course including treatment for his fungemia and bacteremia as well as for aspiration pneumonia given his poor mental status and frequent aspirations.  Despite multiple courses of broad spectrum antibiotics and other supportive measures he eventually succumbed to one of his aspiration pneumonias on the [**9-3**] and passed away.

84M h/o COPD, dCHF, AF, AS (valve area 0.8cm2), s/p superior segmentectomy of right lower lobe [**1-/2833**], now presenting with lethargy and hypoxia. The patient's family reports increasing lethargy for the past 2 days, and was found to be hypoxic to the 60's by the VNA.  His daughter had called his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**9-19**] for weight gain but the decision was made not to increase the Lasix at that time.  He denies shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers/chills, cough, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. The patient was admitted [**Date range (1) 5014**] for community acquired pneumonia and acute on chronic diastolic CHF.  During that admission, the patient was diuresed with Lasix in the MICU for his acute CHF exacerbation.  However, the patient was called out to the floor and prior to discharge, his Lasix dose was decreased from 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 40 mg every other day for an elevated bicarb on labs which was attributed to contraction alkalosis.  His Spironolactone 25 mg daily was also discontinued during that admission for unclear reasons.  He was treated for the pneumonia with Levofloxacin x7 days and a prednisone burst, and PO2 was 95% on 3L at time of discharge with ambulatory sats of 85% RA, unknown ambulatory PO2 on 3L NC.  He has been on supplemental O2 at 2L NC since discharge from his recent hospitalization. In the ED, initial VS were:  117/57, 59, 18, 93% BIPAP (fiO2 30%) Exam: shallow breathing, +use of accessory muscles, crackles at bases bilaterally, 1+ edema bilaterally, belly a little more distended.  MS improved after BIPAP and breathing better, now at FIO2 at 30% on BIPAP. labs - K 5.4 - no peaked T's on EKG, given kayexalate 15gm, BNP: 4239 same as last CHF exacerbation, trop was at baseline, CXR was done and showed heart mod enlarged, worsened pulm edema, small b/l pleural effusions.  Bipap started ~10:45, no IV lasix or nitro drip due to critical AS and didn't want to reduce preload, tried to bump down to nc at 12:45, sats dropped to low-mid 80's On arrival to the MICU, patient was on BIPAP, awake alert following commands and a little irritated wanting to leave the hospital emergently.  He said he was not gonna waste his time here.
The patient is a 70 year old woman with history of PAF, hypertension who presents with shortness of breath. The patient has had some sob and cough since [**3211-12-26**], when she was admitted to St E with chest pain (sharp, substernal, pleuritic, non-positional), shortness of breath and fatigue found to be in new afib and started on coumadin. At that time an ETT was negative and she completed a r/o MI. She was hypoxic at that time requiring 4-6L of nasal cannula. On [**3211-12-29**] she had a CTA chest that showed small bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe atelectasis w/o evidence for PE. On [**3211-12-30**] she had a tte ef>70% and trivial pericardial effusion. She subsequently saw her cardiologist (at [**Hospital3 5031**]) who stopped coumadin as has converted to sinus. She saw her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-13**] cough, sob, abd pain CT abd -> bilat effusions, small pericard effusion and started on levoflox. She represented to her PCP with worsening shortness of breath and fatigue and was referred to the ED. She is very mildly short of breath and her cough is dry. She only gets mild chest pain with coughing. . ED COURSE: Initial vital signs were 100.4 75 88/54 24 96%4L. She transiently dipped her blood pressure to 80s which responded slowly but well to 2L IVF. She also received 1 dose of empiric decadron for adrenal insufficiency. She had a CTA that was negative for PE but showed pericardial and pleural effusions as well as mediastinal fat stranding. A formal TTE was done as well which showed no tamponade physiology. CT surgery was consulted with regard to the fat stranding and recommended getting cultures of the effusions if possible. She received ceftriaxone and azithromycin. . ROS: weight stable, prior abdominal bloating is gone. no rash. no joint pain, no muscle pain. her last colonoscopy was 1year ago and was normal. never been on steroids. no tanning of skin. chronically constipated but had black stools 3 days ago. had been drinking very little for the past week.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is an 85 yo M with a history of Type 2 DM, paroxysmal afib, Chronic systolic CHF, severe LV dysfuntion (EF 20-25%), s/p BiV ICD placment in [**2603**], and VT s/p amiodarone and dofetilide who was transferred from an OSH on [**2609-6-5**] to the Cardiology service [**2-27**] to recurrent VT on mexilitine, transferred to CCU for further monitoring after VT x 2 terminated by ICD firing. Recently, he was admitted to an OSH ([**2609-5-16**] through [**2609-5-29**]) and his ICD was reprogrammed to treat Vt/VF with atp x 1 followed by 1 shock. On this admission he was started on mexelitine and sent home. The patient returned to the OSH [**2609-6-4**] with slow VT (rate of 120s - 130s) on the Mexilitine with pre-syncopal symptoms. The dizziness lasted several minutes while lying in bed. He denied chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath. He was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further EP evaluation and possible VT ablation.
The patient is a 75 year old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, diabetes and chronic renal insufficiency, admitted to Coronary Care Unit following cardiac catheterization for ventilatory support and Intensive Care Unit monitoring.  The patient originally presented to an outside hospital the morning of admission complaining of chest pain and symptoms of congestive heart failure.  An electrocardiogram showed a new left bundle branch block.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital6 253**] for emergent cardiac catheterization.  The patient went immediately to the Catheterization Laboratory upon arrival. Catheterization showed three vessel coronary artery disease, patent graft, left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery and patent saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1.  It was significant for increased right and left filling pressures.  Angioplasty was then performed on the aortoiliac bypass graft, left circumflex coronary artery with failed angioplasty of obtuse marginal 1.  The patient developed significant respiratory distress following catheterization and was ventilated for ventilatory support with transfer to the Coronary Care Unit on a ventilator.
83 yo F with known CAD s/p MI, baseline LBBB who presented with chest pain, back pain starting at 10:45 am.  "Chest ache and across back" constant since that time, worst ([**9-5**])--> [**3377-1-29**]. Pain different than previous MI. Associated with + N/V, then "many bowel movements". No SOB or diaphoresis. Given NTG by EMT without change. Pain is pleuritic in nature. No cough/dizzyness/lightheadedness/palpitations. + chills today. Recent URI/bronchitis improving over last few weeks- has seen Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5196**] in [**Company 189**] several times over last month.

History is obtained from the son who reports that he was with her until 8pm tonight at which point she felt well without complaint. Around 11pm, he received a call from her complaining of SOB. He notes that she has had a non-productive cough for the past few days but no shortness of breath until tonight. She was not complaining of chest pain or any other symptoms. He arrived at her house and reports hearing a gugurling sound while she breathed. EMS was called, and pt's respiratory distress progressed requiring intubation in the field. . Upon arrival to the ED, CXR was obtained consistent with pulmonary edema. EKG was vpaced and unable to be interpreted for ischemia. She was sedated with fent/versed/propofol and vent setting on transfer to the MICU were AC TV: 450 P: 18 peep 13 100% fiO2. Her tox screen positive for benzos and tylenol. INR was elevated at 5.2. Hct was 33.6 down from 36.8 on [**2574-2-28**]. Pt triggered for hypotension and propfol drip was held and she received 2L of NS. This was followed by a dose of 40mg IV lasix . On arrival to the MICU, VS were: T 97.8 BP 175/75 HR 65 O2 100% on the above settings. . Review of systems: Unable to obtain as she is intubated.
74 y/o female with known Aortic Stenosis who presented to ED with chest pain intermittently x 2 weeks. Repeat Echo revealed worsening AS. Referred for elective valve surgery.
This 82 year old  Russian speaking female with known critical aortic stenosis was admitted after a syncopal episode today while at a museum. She was with her daughter and family friend, she felt slightly dizzy and then had episode of loss of consciousness where she fell into the arms of the family. There was no trauma or head injury. The physician family friend thought the patient was pulseless so she initiated CPR, but the pt regained a pulse and consciousness within ~15 seconds. Pt also had bowel and bladder incontinence during this episode.
73 yo male with past medical history significant for CAD s/p CABG, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and peripheral vascular disease PVD was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 3534**] with after having had [**4-30**] substernal chest pain. Patient was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 3534**] on [**3434-12-7**] with a COPD exacerbation and a right lower lobe pneumonia, being treated with IV antibiotics, steroids, and nebulizer treatment. On [**3434-12-9**], patient experienced [**4-30**] substernal chest pain with associated bilateral arm numbness and troponin I of 11. He initially received morphine and ativan without relief and then received 5mg IV metoprolol and IV nitroglycerine with relief. On 12.20, patient found to have troponin I with 83.41 and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization. . At cardiac cath, patient found to have the following: 3 vessel native coronary artery disease; LMCA 50% distal in-stent restenosis; LAD occluded proximally; LCX 60% at its origin with occluded OM branches except for OM3 which was occluded distally; RCA known to be occluded and not selectively engaged; LIMA-LAD widely patent to distal LAD. SVG-RCA was known to be occluded and was not engaged selectively. The SVG-D-OM had an ulcerated 80% stenosis at the diagnoal origin and widely patent OM stent. Patient had a drug eluting stent placed (Cypher 3.5 x 18) to the SVG-Diag-OM. 170cc dye used during procedure and hemodynamics not performed (Aortic pressure 145/74 with HR 73). Post cath course complicated by development of acute shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and respiratory distress, thought likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema. Patient started on a NRB and received 60mg furosemide IV total (20 then 40), morphine 5mg, and was started on a nitro drip for elevated blood pressures to SBPs to 190s. . Upon arrival to the floor, patient was started on BiPap but had persistent respiratory distress with use of accessory muscles and increased CO2 retention, as seen on ABG (7.29 / 59 / 160). Patient was intubated with anesthesia and started on propafol for sedation. With increased sedation, patient also became hypotensive to SBPs 70s-80s and was started on dopamine for blood pressure support.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5247**] is a 75 yo male with h/o CHF and CAD s/p CABG who presented to presented on [**8-11**] to [**Hospital3 3534**] with a complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath. Patient is intubated at time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], and history was obtained almost entirely from discharge summary. . At time of admission to [**Hospital3 3534**], he described sudden onset of sharp left-sided chest pain, with onset at rest. On arrival to the ED, he reported shortness of breat and was found to have SpO2 84% on room air. He was placed on a nonrebreather and was subsequently intubated in the ED for respiratory failure. The patient was treated with lasix and responded with good UOP and improvement of his respiratory status. ABG performed 90 minutes after intubation was 7.18/72/86. . Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5247**] was subseqnetly admitted to the CCC at [**Hospital1 3275**] where he was started on standing IV lasix, Nitro paste 1" q8h, an insulin drip and Propofol for sedation. Anti-hypertensives were held, but he was continued on ASA, Plavix, and Lipitor. Patient was felt to be septic due to an episode of hypotension with a fever to 101 and a leukocytosis of 17.9K. Patient was reported to be maintaining BP's of 100/60 with Vasopressin, Levophed, and IVF boluses. . He underwent an TTE which showed mid to distal hypokinetic areas of the LV and a hypokinetic apex, moderate MR, and an EF of 15-20%, which is notably diminished from an EF of 40-60% two weeks prior. Of note, patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 3534**] from [**Date range (1) 5249**] with a similar presentation; at that time elevated troponins were felt to be related to his renal insufficiency. . On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. ROS is notable for recent fever. All of the other review of systems were negative. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for patient motioning to the presence of epigastric pain at time of arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] (symptoms of indigestion previously noted to be his anginal equivalent). ROS is notable for the absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope Hospital, he had been complaining of shortness of breath over the days prior to admission.
HPI: 78yo F well-known to East Surgery service from prolonged hospitalization [**Date range (1) 5257**]/10.  She had initially presented with a colonic perforation due to erosion from a L hip prosthesis, and underwent a Hartmann's procedure (sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy).  She then required an emergent R-->L Fem-Fem bypass for acute LLE ischemia.  The hip was treated with sequential washouts and hardware removal.  Her post-operative course was extensive, but notable for GI bleeding presenting as falling anemia, for which an EGD showed mild esophagitis managed with [**Hospital1 **] protonix. A colonoscopy through the stoma was unsuccessful because the stoma had sloughed and retracted below the skin level.  She also developed CHF and hypothyroidism managed with diuretics and synthroid, respectively.  Wound issues included minor wound infection at the midline incision managed with wet-to-dry, a VAC at the L hip changed serially in the OR and later at the bedside, and mild breakdown at the Fem-Fem bypass site treated with betadine swabs.  She was finally discharged on [**2931-4-17**] on a prolonged course of Zosyn, Daptomycin, and Fluconazole via a PICC.  Since discharge she has required 4u PRBC transfusion for anemia and guaiac positive ostomy output: 2u on [**4-23**] and 2u on [**4-28**] (Hct was 23).  She denies headache, dizziness, CP, or SOB.  She denies abdominal pains, nausea, although did have one episode of non-bloody non-bilious emesis this morning and one earlier episode 4d ago.  Per the rehab notes, the heparin SQ was discontinued in favor of coumadin, which the pt's daughters relate was done because she was "bleeding" at the injection site.
71F with PMH of CHF, AAA, and chronic back pain presenting from Rehab with confusion and disorientation, found to have a T=101, SaO2=88%. She was sent to the emergency room for further evaluation. In the emergency room she was somnolent, but arousable, and was confused and disoriented. She was transiently hypotensive and received 3-4L of IVF. CXR was consistent with pneumonia and she was given Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Zosyn. She was then transferred to the MICU for further management.
77 yo M NH resident h/o schizophrenia, CAD, HTN, dementia p/w hypoxia and FTT from NH. According to the NH records, pt had an episode of desaturation to mid 80's on RA several days ago. He came up to 91% on 2L NC. He was also noted to have decreased po intake, eating only with assistance and only preferred foods. IVF fluids were given. CXR at NH neg, UA pos. Started on levaquin 500 mg po on [**2-27**], also given 1 dose of CTX. Subsequently, ucx came back as < 10,000 organisms. As patient continued to be hypotensive and hypoxic, he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]. According to NH note, the pt is mostly non-verbal, AAOx1. Pt was able to nod yes or no in the ED and denied cough, diarrhea. + SOB, + dizziness. He was unreponsive for other questions. On evaluation in the ICU he was unresponsive. In the ED, BP 85/65 initially, then 73/54. Other VS: HR 61, RR 22, O2Sat 100%NRB. He received a total of 2.9L. A foley was placed and he urinated about 225cc. Pt received empiric Vancomycin, Levaquin and FLagyl for possible aspiration PNA although CXR showed no clear consolidation. UA was done and was negative. An EKG was done an revealed SR, HR 80, NA, loss of RW in inferior leads, V1, V2 and STE in V2 with overall low voltage. CE were significant for Trop 0.14, CK 596, MB flat. Cardiology was called, ekg was faxed: assessment - CE leak likely demand, EKG with new anteroseptal q's from [**3047**] but no clear ischemic changes currently. Recommended: Serial EKGs, cycle CEs. Serial EKG showed no change.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5277**] is a 77 year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG, HTN, schizophrenia, recent admission for hypoxia/hypotension with unknown etiology who presents from rehab with hypoxia to 78 on RA - 88 on NC. His PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 5278**] started him on cefepime 1g IV bid for one week starting on [**3-13**] for a positive UA in setting of elevated white count. According to her, she sent three C diff samples that were negative and had given him empiric flagyl for three days in the interim. . He was sent to the ER, where he was found to be 92-96 on NRB mask. His BP ranged from 90s-120s. He was intubated for hypoxia (etomidate and succinylcholine given). CXR was performed and he was given levoflox and ctx x 1. OGT was placed. Thick yellow sputum was suctioned from his ETT. He recieved 3L NS. Troponin returned at 0.13 with flat CK and his EKG (Qs in V1-4 but no change from prior) was faxed to cardiology, who did not suspect acute MI and recommended he be given aspirin only (he was given ASA 325 mg po x 1). His WBC was 25.6 with 92% PMNs and no bands. UA was negative. Lactate was 1.7. Electrolytes were normal. . Of note, he was recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 5279**] in the ICU after being admitted for desat to 80s, hypotension. He was started on empiric antibiotics at that time for possible aspiration pna, however all culture data and imaging was negative and was stopped. Imaging of his L ankle decubitus ulcer did not show osteomyelitis.  He was also worked up for AMS with head CT and neuro c/s.  Neuro felt he may have had a small TIA with R sided weakness and transient R sided facial droop.  He was continued on aspirin, an increased dose of statin and Plavix.  His neurological symptoms had resolved at the time of discharge.  He was fed through an NGT, however when he was discharged to his NH this was pulled and he continued to have poor nutritional intake, which is not ideal especially given his chronic decubitus ulcers (5 of them). He has an appointment for PEG placement on [**3-21**] for poor nutritional status. Echo during his last hospitalization showed EF 35%, and EKG and CEs were consistent with likely MI prior to admission (trop 0.14). He was admitted to the MICU for further care. . ROS: Unable to assess given pt sedated, intubated
This is an 89 year old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, gastrointestinal bleed with chronic anemia, chronic renal insufficiency who had been complaining at home of lower back pain.  On the morning of admission her daughter was helping her to the bathroom when the patient collapsed without breathing, without pulse.  Daughter and [**Name2 (NI) 795**] initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation and Emergency Medical Services were called.  Emergency Medical Services arrived and placed an automated external defibrillator which determined a shockable rhythm.  She received one shock of 200 joules which converted her to a pulseless electrical activity rhythm.  She was given Atropine and a second shock and went into an atrial fibrillation rhythm with a rapid ventricular response.  The patient was started on Lidocaine drip and was transferred to the [**Hospital6 253**] Emergency Room. Total time pulseless was approximately 15 minutes.  The patient arrived to the Emergency Room in rapid atrial fibrillation with a blood pressure in the 80s and was started on intravenous fluids.  Initial electrocardiograms showed no significant ST or T wave changes.  Her first CK was 48, her component was 2.7, her potassium was 2.5.  At this time it is felt likely that she had suffered a primary arrhythmia leading to her arrest.  The patient was not taken to the Catheterization Laboratory but was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for further management.
58 yo M with h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia, no known CAD, transferred from OSH s/p V-fib arrest [**1-3**] AMI. Patient reports having chest pain, back pain under left scapula and left shoulder pain starting at 6 pm on [**6-23**] while he was driving. He took 2 ASA at that time, the pain stopped then started again later on. Patient then went home and developed severe pain while at rest which did not resolve. He was driving to [**Hospital3 5297**] ED by his wife. At the OSH patient found to have ST elevations in V2-V6, went into V-fib, s/p two shock at 200J then 360 J (down 7 min per flow sheet), patient started on lidocaine, nitro gtt's, integrilin and heparin started. He was A+O after this and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath. Upon arrival patient still A+O, s/p successfull intervention with DES to mid LAD. Upon arrival to the CCU, patient pain free, A+O, integrilin running, off lidocaine. Having some AIVR on tele s/p 5 mg IV lopressor. Patient has never had similar pain in the past, is able to walk "miles" without sob or chest pain. Had EKG approximately 5 yrs ago and was normal per patient. Has swelling of ankles when he stands for long times, sleeps with four pillows at home although able to lie flat, no PND, orthopnea.

His wife thinks that the whole episode lasted approximately 30 minutes. She became concerned and called EMS. On their arrival he was unresponsive to stimuli, his SBP was as high as 220mmHg systolic and fingerstick was 222. His pupils were noted to be unreactive and he seemed to have a right gaze preference. He was brought to [**Hospital1 18**].  En route he developed tonic-clonic activity of his right upper and lower extremities. This activity continued upon his arrival to the ED.  He was subsequently intubated for airway protection.  He was admitted to the intensive care unit overnight.  He was loaded with phenytoin.  He was successfully weaned off of sedation and extubated this morning, the second hospital day. There is no history of antecedant illness.  He has been compliant with his medication (keppra) and has not missed any doses per his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] did admit to alcohol consumption on the night prior to presentation but not in excess.
This is an 83 year old woman with myeloproliferative disorder, who is on a baby aspirin a day, who presented with melena and coffee ground emesis.  Two days prior to admission, the patient was fatigued, but otherwise well.  One day prior to admission, the patient started feeling diffuse abdominal pain all day, felt nausea, vomiting of coffee grounds in the evening and then melena. The patient admits to being lightheaded at that time with increasing lightheadedness this morning. She denies any chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, cough, orthopnea, sick contacts, or suspicious foods.  She went to the Emergency Room where her vital signs revealed a temperature of 97.9 F.; heart rate of 114; respiratory rate of 14, blood pressure of 154/65.  She was given one to two liters of normal saline, 40 mg of intravenous Protonix, and then taken to the EGD Suite where many clots were seen and also some oozing was seen but no clear etiology, gastritis, ulcer or vessels could be found. At the EGD Suite, the patient had a blood pressure of 131/62 and a heart rate of 112.  At the time of admission, she was complaining of belching and lower abdominal pain.
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 5349**] is an 87 year-old Russian female with a past medical history significant for multi infarct dementia, coronary artery disease, diastolic dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, pacemaker for heart block, deep venous thrombosis and PE and aspiration of thin liquids who presented from her nursing home on [**2518-3-26**] after the caretakers at the nursing home noticed an area of erythema and tenderness on the patient's left lower concern.  Their concern was for a cellulitis.  The patient was also noted to be sleepy more so then her baseline with a decreased room air saturation.  In the Emergency Department the patient was afebrile.  She was in no acute distress.  There was an area on her left lateral upper calf that was erythematous and slightly warm likely a cellulitis.  The patient was treated with Ancef 1 gram intravenous.  She was also given Flagyl 500 mg intravenous and Levaquin 500 mg intravenous for question of an aspiration pneumonia with the patient's history of aspiration and the drop in room air sats to 89%.  This saturation improved to 97% on 2 liters.  The patient had a chest x-ray that was read s fluid in the fissure, but cannot rule out a retrocardiac infiltrate.  Therefore the patient was admitted for management of cellulitis and possible pneumonia.
[**Age over 90 **]yo F BIBA from home c/o chest pain radiating to back.  In ED,pt acutely decompensated, becoming tachycardic, hypotensive,unresponsive.  She was intubated. Hemodynamics improved on dopamine.   Echo reveals pericardial effusion with tamponade, CXR reportedly reveals widened mediastinum.  Cardiac surgery is called for emergent evaluation.  She does have a h/o asc. aortic aneurysm of 4.2cm
The patient is a 67 year old female with a long medical history including atrial fibrillation without Coumadin (the patient declined), supraventricular tachycardia post ablation times two, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2855**], migraines, and prescription medication abuse who presented to the Emergency Room on [**2840-6-29**] complaining of episodic speech arrest for two days and nausea, diarrhea and headache for one day. The patient was in her usual state of health until [**2840-6-27**], when she experienced several episodes of speech arrest while in the car with her husband.  The next day, she awoke with severe headache and nausea with diarrhea and vomiting times four in addition to her episodic speech arrest. Her primary care physician saw her and drew blood which revealed a potassium of 2.9.   MRI showed periventricular white matter changes by the inferior [**Doctor Last Name 528**] of the right lateral ventricle as well as left mastoiditis. Her symptoms continued the next day with headache and vomiting times two as well as speech arrest.  The patient went to the [**Hospital1 1426**] Emergency Department. In the Emergency Room, her vital signs were temperature 97.0 F.; blood pressure 155/74; pulse 72; respiratory rate 16; oxygen saturation 94%.  She was alert and oriented times three.  Her examination was nonfocal except for asymmetric patellar reflexes and difficulty word finding.  The patient was given p.o. potassium and started on Clarithromycin. While receiving an EEG from Neurology, the patient had a tonic-clonic seizure.  She received one gram total of Dilantin over a one hour time period. On hour following her seizure, she received 30 mg of Diltiazem, 10 mg of Lisinopril and 28 mg Nadolol.  An hour after receiving all three of those medications, her systolic blood pressure dropped to the 80s, her heart rate dropped to the 50s and she had decreasing mental status.  She received 28 mg of calcium gluconate intravenous, Atropine 3 mg intravenously and 500 cc. of normal saline.  Her EKG at the time showed a narrow junctional rhythm at 54 beats per minute, T wave inversions in leads III and AVf.  The patient received more calcium as well as Glucagon and was intubated for airway protection.  Pacing pads were placed. Labs in the Emergency Room showed a normal CBC, normal PT and PTT, normal urinalysis, normal liver function tests, normal CK and troponin. Labs were notable for a potassium of 2.9.  Her toxicology screen was negative.  A lumbar puncture showed no cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. CT scan of the head done on [**6-30**] showed mucosal thickening in her bilateral maxillary and ethmoid sinuses.  Chest x-ray showed minimal bilateral atelectasis.  MRA was normal.  MRI of the head showed mild changes due to small vessel disease. MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on Dopamine, Propofol and Glucagon intravenously.  Her initial EKG showed sinus rhythm at 77 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals.  Shortly after her admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was extubated.  MRI was repeated and showed no focal abnormalities.  MRA showed no abnormalities. On her first day in the Medical Intensive Care Unit she experienced multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response followed by five second pauses. Her blood pressure decreased and was restored with 1 mg of Atropine. A Cardiology consultation came and placed a pacing wire. Pulmonary artery catheterization revealed no association between her heart rate, blood pressure and MVO2, therefore, there was suspicion for autonomic dysfunction.  Dopamine was weaned off.  She was seen by Electrophysiology who determined that she had sick sinus syndrome and implanted a pacemaker on [**2840-7-2**]. An echocardiogram was also done on [**7-2**].  This showed a mildly dilated left atrium, normal left ventricular thickness, left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55% and one plus mitral regurgitation. Despite treatment of her bradycardia, episodes of hypotension continued times two, requiring IVF of 250 cc. plus Midodrine 10 mg times one.  She was seen by the Congestive heart failure Service who recommended Diltiazem for her blood pressure control. The patient had one episode of shortness of breath on [**2840-7-4**] in the morning which was resolved with Lasix. Her mental status improved to the point where she was conversational on [**2840-7-4**], however, she became confused

The patient also suffered C. difficile colitis during this admission.  Toward the end of her hospitalization, the patient was noted to have acute tachypnea, pH 7.27, CO2 70, which resolved with minimal intervention the following day.  The patient was discharged to a skilled nursing facility on [**7-12**] on a plan for linezolid for four weeks for her VRE abscess, and Flagyl for two weeks for her C. difficile colitis. At the skilled nursing facility, the patient has done poorly, with continued lethargy, anorexia and depression.  She was noted to have decreased sodium to 119 on [**7-21**], which was question of serum-inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.  The patient developed cough on [**7-16**], for which she was started on Robitussin, and yesterday she was noted to have hypoxia with an oxygen saturation of 93% on 2 liters nasal cannula. This morning, shortly after breakfast, the patient was noted to become more tachypneic and somnolent, having an oxygen saturation in the 60s on 2 liters, improving to 97% on 100% non-rebreather.  She became increasingly somnolent, and became completely unresponsive.  The patient was bag mask ventilated and referred to [**Hospital1 186**] for further evaluation.

He was brought to [**Hospital3 6375**] Hospital for evaluation of stroke. CT there was unremarkable. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further evaluation. The patient went into flash pulmonary edema and was intubated at [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department. He was transferred to neurologic Intensive Care Unit where he was diuresed a total of four liters.  Transthoracic echocardiogram was done and showed ejection fraction of 25%. Heparin was started.  Swallow studies were difficult due to a lack of cooperation. He pulled out the nasogastric tube five times.

60 year old male with extensive past cardiac history, including AVR x 2 for bacterial endocarditis, c/o occasional episodes of dyspnea on exertion. Most recent echo shows worsening mitral valve regurgitation, now moderate to severe, and he presents for surgical evaluation.
The patient is a 79-year-old man with an extensive past medical history including severe gastrointestinal bleeding from colon CA and congestive heart failure requiring aortic valvoplasty. The aortic valve area increased from .6 to .7 cm2 after this procedure. Catheterization showed mild coronary artery disease but severe aortic stenosis. He was referred for aortic valve replacement. Symptomatically he has had problems with exertional dizziness.
83 YO M w AF/FLUT (not anticoagulated), bioprosthetic AVR for AS, prior colon Ca s/p hemicolectomy presenting from [**Location (un) 738**] Health Center Rehab with increased confusion, lethargy and cloudy urine. The patient is a very poor historian so his history was obtained largely from his daughter and HCP. She reports that the patient was largely independant prior to a [**Month (only) 115**] admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for MRSA bacteremia. He was treated with 4 weeks of abx and discharged to rehab. While at rehab he was doing well until approximately 2 weeks ago. He began to develop some mild confusion and had a fall. He reportedly did not have any sequelae after the fall and it is not clear if the patient had any secondary trauma although his changes in mental status have also occurred over the past couple of weeks. Over the past week, he has become more fatigued and lethargic, not getting out of bed as he usually does. At one point, he did pull out his foley. Over the past day, the patient's confusion became much more severe. He developed some diarrhea and his family was concerned that his confusion was [**1-22**] a UTI. His rehab noted that the patient had a leukocytosis and so he was brought into the ED for further evaluation. . Upon presentation to the ED, his initial VS were: 101.8 110 105/47 18 95%. Shortly after arrival his SBP decreased to 84. Exam was reportably notable for mild confusion (normally oriented times 3, but not oriented to time in the ED) a LUSB ejection murmur and cloudy urine. Labs were notable for a leukocytosis with left shift but no bands, a lactate of 1.4 and a u/a with >50 WBCs and positive leuks. EKG was notable for new ST segment depressions in V4-V6 with a rate of 117. Two 18g PIVs were placed and less than 1L NS were given. Blood and urine cultures were sent and the patient was given cefepime 2g, levoflox 750mg IV once and APAP 325mg. VS prior to transfer were: 107 22 97/52 95%. . Upon arrival to the floor, the patient reports recent confusion and possibly some chest pain within the past few days although he denies active chest pain and is unable to provide any additional information. .

The patient was a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old right-handed man with a history of angina, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia who suffered a large right middle cerebral artery stroke and was admitted to Neurology and was then transferred to the Medicine Service with flash pulmonary edema complicated by post diuresis hypernatremia, aspiration pneumonia, without return to baseline mental status. SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Due to no likelihood of improvement, the patient was made comfort measures only. This was in agreement with the patient's family.  A morphine drip was started.  Palliative Care was involved in making the patient more comfortable.  In discussions with the family, it was decided to give the patient no intravenous fluids and no tube feeds.  The patient was comfortable in bed, and the morphine drip was titrated to the patient's comfort. I was called to pronounce the patient on [**2956-11-9**] at 16:30.  The patient was unresponsive with pupils fixed and dilated.  There was no gag reflex and no corneal reflex. There was no withdrawal to stimuli.  There were no breath sounds or heart sounds.  I was able to communicate with the patient's daughter, and her family did not want a postmortem examination.  The attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], was notified. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6520**], [**MD Number(1) 6521**] Dictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6522**] MEDQUIST36 D:  [**2957-4-22**] 18:11:48 T:  [**2957-4-22**] 19:50:27 Job#:  [**Job Number 6523**]
The patient is a 74 year old man with metastatic adenocarcinoma of unclear primary, presumably lung.  This was diagnosed in [**3153**], after biopsy of supraclavicular lymph node.  He was treated with XRT and surgery and did quite well subsequently.  Recently, he was diagnosed with microscopic hematuria. Urologic evaluation revealed a duplicated right ureter with filling defect and wall thickening in the duplicated ureter at the level of the iliac crest with right hydronephrosis. A right ureteronephrectomy was planned with suspicion for a transitional cell carcinoma.  On laparoscopy, studding of the liver with presumed metastases was noted.  The procedure was aborted after multiple liver biopsies.  The patient was extubated post surgery but subsequently developed respiratory distress and wheezing.  Chest x-ray was done and was suggestive of pulmonary edema.  The patient was hypoxic on 100% oxygen and was reintubated.  He was then sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for 24 hours and then diuresed. He was able to come off ventilator and was sent to ALCOVE.
79F NH resident, MMP including CAD, CHF--EF 30%, anemia, DM, dementia/bipolar disease, prior GIB [**2-17**] gastritis, cholelithiasis, who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 872**] on [**2692-1-31**] where she was diagnosed with a liver mass.  On that admission, she was also found to have the flu, and was treated empirically for PNA and UTI with azithro/cefpodoxime/flagyl. She was brought in from [**Hospital 99**] Rehab with fever, lethargy, and maroon stools. According to the NH records, she had been lethargic, but without any pain. On admission, she was non-verbal, and moaning. * In the ED, T 98.3, HR 60, BP 78/28, R 16, O2sat 98% on 4L.  She had 2 BM with maroon stools as well as bright red blood per rectum. NGT lavage was negative, other than some inital traumatic placement.  She was given IVF x 3L, and was started on a peripheral dopamine gtt at 20mcg/kg with increase in SBP to 123.
The patient is a 65-year-old Caucasian gentleman who presented to the [**Hospital1 341**] Emergency Department from an outside hospital for three episodes of spiking fevers, significant chills, and rigors, dyspnea, and tachypnea, and episodes of delirium.  The patient states this started Thursday at around 3:00 p.m. when he was driving home for work, but he did not measure his temperature.  After one hour of feeling very hot, having chills, and extreme rigors the patient stated the episode went away.  Again, he had this same episode with diaphoresis, chills, rigors, tachypnea, and a fever to 104 degrees Fahrenheit on Friday.  The patient was admitted to an outside hospital - which was [**Hospital6 6559**]. The patient had another episode on the morning of admission to [**Hospital1 69**].  While at the outside hospital, he was worked up for fever of unknown origin with an unknown infectious site.  The patient had two episodes of rigors at the outside hospital with fevers to 105.  Per the patient, he had a lumbar puncture under fluoroscopy and a negative head computer tomography.  He had a negative KUB, and blood cultures that were drawn.  The patient's vital signs other than fever were stable except for a desaturation to the low 80s during his rigorous episodes. The rigorous episodes needed Tylenol; although, this did not shorten the course of the episode but did bring the fever down. He denies any recent travel history, visits or exposures to forests or [**Last Name (LF) 6560**], [**First Name3 (LF) 684**] ingestion of recent raw or undercooked food.  All other review of systems were essentially negative. The patient has no trauma and no obvious signs of puncture. No obvious infectious exposures.  The patient denies any chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain - but does state some dysuria, hesitancy, and urgency, and the feeling of being dehydrated.  The patient denies a cough, headache, neck pain, photophobia, recent trauma, blood in the urine, blood from any other orifice, cold symptoms, myalgias, arthralgias, or any recent symptoms of this kind. The patient's daughter states that during these rigorous episodes the patient gets delirious and misnames common objects that are around the room.  An example, was he called a person an envelope.  He had been anxious since Thursday, especially during these rigorous episodes; and, per the daughter, he was agitated and not himself. The patient's past medical history is significant for multiple uric acid stones, which the patient feels may be leading to this presentation.  The patient states about one year ago he was diagnosed with urate stone at the outside hospital, but nothing was done for it, and he does feel he has passed the stone either.
77 F w/ presumed ILD presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 614**] on [**3478-1-2**] w/ sob and transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for lung Bx s/p procedure doing well. Two wks prior to presentation she had the onset of shortness of breath and cough after just getting over viral gastroenteritis. She went to her PCP and was treated with levofloxacin x 7 days. . Symptoms continued so she presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 614**] [**1-2**] tachypnea and hypoxia. Imaging suggested pneumonia and she started empirically on ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Despite treatment she developed worsening hypoxia. Given concern for IPF exacerbation she was started on solumedrol 80 mg IV q.6h and then q8h with minimal response. On [**3478-1-6**] she and episode of hypoxia with saturations falling to the mid 80s on 5 liters requiring a nonrebreather but eventually weaned back down to 2 liters facemask. On [**3478-1-8**] she again had an acute episode of hypoxia this time requiring BIPAP but responded to diuresis with lasix. . As she had never had a lung bx to definitively dx her disease she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for VATS lung bx. On arrival she continued to have a 6L by nasal cannula O2 requirement to maintain saturations >92%. She was continued on levofloxacin and steroids despite low suspicion for infectious etiology. Pt underwent VATS RLL wedge biopsy [**1-9**] which she tolerated well. She underwent further diuresis and CT was removed [**1-11**].
46 yo AA woman with h/o SLE, ESRD on hemodialysis, htn, hyperlipidemia, and cardiomyopathy, CHF, and recent immunosuppression with tacrolimius/cellcept/IVIG in an attempted preparation for receiving a kidney transplant from her sister presented initially on [**7-31**] with atypical chest pain. She had no ischemic EKG changes, and her initial set of cardiac enzymes was flat. She also complained of epigastric/RUQ pain. Finally, she had subacute complaints of subjective fever and bronchitis symptoms. In the ED, her vitals were T = 97.5, (T@ dialysis = 99.2), BP = 191/97, HR = 70, RR = 20 and 100% RA. . She had severe hyperkalemia to 8.1, and underwent urgent hemodialysis. In hemodialysis, she developed significant bleeding from a site of recent tooth extraction, and then arterial bleeding from her AV fistula site when the HD line was disconnected. She was managed with DDAVP 15mcg IV x i, 10units of cryoprecipitate; additionally, ENT stopped the oral bleeding with Ag local tx, and AV fistula bleeding stopped after 55min of continuous pressure.  The working suspicion is that she was suffering from uremic platelet dysfunction. . She was admitted to MICU after she had developed persistent bleeding from the site of her recent tooth extraction as well as arterial bleeding from her AV fistula site. The bleeding from her tooth extraction site stopped after she was seen by ENT and this was treated with local Ag therapy.  The bleeding from her AV fistula site stopped after continuous pressure for 55min, and DDAVP. . Overnight, several events took place. First, she remained chest pain free, but her troponin trended from 0.06 to 0.26 and then back down to 0.06 with the only EKG changes of new TWI in V6 and borderline Twave flattening in lead I.  Her CK and MB remained flat throughout. Secondly, she was ruled out for AAA and PE by CTangiogram. Next, she had a Tmax of 101.6, and repeat blood cultures were drawn. She additionally underwent CTangiogram of torso: No evidence of PE; no aortic aneurysm/dissection; no pathologic LAD; non-specific thickening of the pylorus. Also, her labs were significant for the following: . - evidence of hemolysis with hapto < 20, elevated LDH - no evidence of TTP, no schistocytes on peripheral smear, and no evidence of DIC (nl coags, fibrinogen elevated) . - platelets remained stable in 50's range - DIC Ab returned positive; heme/onc consulted re: anticoagulation strategy in setting of recent significant bleeding . - transaminitis trending downward - elevated amylase/lipase - now trending downward. .

He had an initial event of VT within a year of his MI and had an ICD placed at that time. He did well until this past summer when his ICD fired twice, once for Afib and once for VT. Today he underwent an extensive ablation of his scar. At the end of the procedure he developed a slow VT which was broken with lidocaine 150 mg IV x1. He was started on mexilitine and transfered to the CCU for further management. EKG NSR 82bpm RSR' c/w right intravenricular conduction delay TWI V4-V6 when compared with [**2685-9-18**] EKG, no significant changes are noted.
65M with a history of inferior posterior MI s/p three vessel CABG in [**2668**] with a large residual scar and recurrent VT s/p VT ablation on [**2685-11-5**] and discharged from the CCU service on [**2685-11-8**] who presents with recurrent symptomatic VT. He reports that he started having a feeling of palpitations and increased DOE and SOB even at rest starting at some point on Saturday. He denies CP, nausea, chest pressure, radiation, LE edema, orthopnea, or PND - but he wears a CPAP mask. He did have some night sweats. Today when he reported these symptoms to his cardiologist, he was referred to the [**Hospital1 **] ED. In the ED there he was in and out of VT. His pacer was interrogated with showed recurrent VT ongoing with some ATP and 18 continuous hours of VT on Saturday. He has a report of a BP of 59/34 there, but all other BPs were 100s/80s. Given this, he was transfered to here for further management. . In our ED, initial VS were T 97.8, P 60, BP 110/71, RR 20, O2sat 99%. He went into a perfusing VT at around 130/min with a BP of 101/72. He was symptomatic, but not syncopal or presyncopal. He was bolused with lidocaine 100 mg IV x1 and started on a drip at 1 mg/min with no improvement in his VT. He was admitted to the CCU for further management. . On the floor, he feels well. He complains of mild cough and a sensation that he cannot take a deep breath. Otherwise, he has no complaints.
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with multiple chronic medical problems presenting with a several week history of wet, produtive cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, hypoxia and abnormal chest x-ray. Several weeks ago, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 7246**] developed fever, chest congestion and shortness of breath. She had several Xray evaluations which demonstrated focal nodular abnormality of the RUL and extensive abnormal density at the lung bases with pleural disease and low lung volumes. Over time, the lung base lesions increased and small effusions developed. She was treated with antibiotics--levofloxacin, then clindamycin then combination Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone and Flagyl (day 1 [**2519-5-13**]). Follow up CXR on [**5-25**] was without significant change. During this time, she also had evaluation for influenza and was treated with oseltamivir for 2 days, but this was discontinued, as the H1N1 evaluation was negative. . Despite treatment with antimicrobials and supportive medications, the patient failed to improve clinically or on imaging. She continued to have a wet productive cough, low grade fever, night sweats, poor appetite (progressive over disease course) and hypoxia since [**4-15**]. In the ED, vitals were: 98.1 96/65 100 18 99% 4L NC. Her BP remained low throughout the ED course 78-106/39-51. She was given ceftriaxone, flagyl, asa 325 mg and 2 L IVF and admitted to the ICU for hypotension. Currently, she is bothered only by her cough, otherwise, she is feeling well.
The patient is a 58-year-old white male with a history of coronary artery disease (status post recent percutaneous coronary intervention on [**3342-6-22**] with placement of two SIRIUS moving stents in the mid left anterior descending artery) who presented with 10/10 substernal chest pain. The patient was sitting down this morning when he had the sudden onset of crushing chest pain.  He took sublingual nitroglycerin times three without relief of the chest pain. He came to the hospital with electrocardiogram changes (specifically anterior T wave peaking) and was referred for catheterization. The patient was found to have a total occlusion of his mid left anterior descending artery and 90% stenosis of the second obtuse marginal.  The mid left anterior descending artery stenosis was in the region of the recently placed stents.  Integrilin was initiated.  Angio-Jet catheter was advanced to the distal [**Year (4 digits) **] which appeared to have a large dissection.  Two overlapping stents were placed in the mid left anterior descending artery.  Angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis or evidence of dissection. The patient was pain free after catheterization.  The second obtuse marginal with the 90% lesion was noted to be stable from the prior catheterization.  The left circumflex was patent.  A right heart catheterization was not performed. The patient was currently without chest pain.  He denied palpitations or shortness of breath and was resting comfortably.
62 year old male with h/o CAD, HTN, HC, ?AF (on coumadin - per pt b/o stents), RA, multiple prior myocardial infarctions s/p multiple stents, and recent in-[**First Name3 (LF) **] thrombosis of OM2 [**First Name3 (LF) **] in [**3346-3-9**] in the setting of discontinuation of his clopidogrel for 5 days in anticipation of the same elective surgery, now again admitted for elective left ankle fusion for rheumatoid associated arthritis, found to have an NSTEMI post-OP, transferred to Medicine for further management. . Since the PTCA to his OM2 in-[**Date Range **] thrombosis, the patient says he is back to his usual baseline. He does get reproducible angina with exertion (working in the yard), but very infrequently gets angina at rest (this is also longstanding). What limits his activity currently is his severe left ankle pain. Before his ankle began really bothering him, about a year ago, he was walking three miles on the treadmill everyday with occasional nitroglycerin use, and no shortness of breath. Now he simply can't exercise secondary to the pain. . He used to smoke remotely, three PPD but quit in the 70s. He doesn't recall having any pulmonary problems, and denies any dsypnea. . He underwent left ankle fusion on [**5-20**]. His coumadin has been held since Sunday ([**5-14**]). He was continued on ASA and Plavix for the procedure, per cardiology and orthopedics, as his prior in-[**Month/Day (2) **] thrombosis occurred while off Plavix. Post-operatively, he developed new ST depressions in I and aVL as well as a bump in his cardiac enzymes. He was started on a heparin drip and transferred to medicine. . Of note, post-OP course was also complicated by nose bleed, now s/p nose packing. His Hct dropped from admission Hct of 35 to 25 post-OP. EBL during operation was 400cc. . On arrival to the medicine floor, his VS were stable. He denied any CP throughout the hospital stay, only minimal chest pressure lasting a few seconds shortly prior to admission. Also no SOB or palpitations. He denies any dizziness and did not note any blood from below. He did remember blood coming from his oropharynx and nose post-operatively. .
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 62 year-old man with extensive coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure (EF 30%) admitted on [**3346-7-19**] to orthopedic service for a left ankle wound infection.  He is s/p left ankle fusion done on [**3346-5-20**] for his rheumatoid arthritis.  He had a debridement on [**3346-6-30**] and was put on keflex.  As his wound continued to drain, he was admitted on [**3346-7-19**] for a wash-out in the operating room.  After the washout, he had a drop in hematocrit from 36-30 following  and was transferred to the medical ICU for further care.
Patient is an 86 y/o male with type II diabetes, CAD, CHF EF 25%, AVR, CRI who presents to outpt cardiac clinic in reported rapid atrial fibrillation and hyperglycemia. Patient was sent to the ED and rapid afib resolved but patient found with blood sugar > 600. Patient urine ketones were negative and mentating normally. Patient got 1L NS in the ED and sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for glucose management. Patient states that he has no CP, or palpitations. Denies any SOB, fever, chills. Denies any n/v. Patient states that his urination has increased and he is "very thirsty." Patient states that he has been compliant on all his medication but has been eating a lot of sweets over the holidays. . ROS: Patient complaining of bilateral leg cramping in the calf.
This is an 89 yo M with history of CAD s/p CABG, CHF secondary to ischemic CMY with EF 25%, Afib, IDDM who presents from his NH today with acute onset shortness of breath. In the ED, he was initially thought to be in acute heart failure, given that he was hypertensive to the 170's, so he was given lasix 40mg IV x1, placed on a nitro gtt and bipap. CXR revealed a large RLL consolidation, so the patient was also covered for HAP with vanco and zosyn, but only vanco given. Sats were only 90% on BiPAP at 10/5, FiO2 0.50. Labs were significant for a large bandemia, lactate of 5.1, troponin 0.19 and mild renal failure. 10 units of regular insulin was given for a fingerstick of 450. Because the patient is DNR/DNI (which was reconfirmed by the ED with the patient's HCP), he was not intubated and transferred to the MICU for further management.
The patient is a 58 year old male with a history of DM, HTN, dyslipidemia,PVD, CAD with history of MI, who transfered for cardiac catheterization for a question of NSTEMI in the setting of infection.  As noted, the patient has a history of CAD, with an MI in [**3354**], for which he PCI to RCA in [**3354**] at [**Hospital1 332**].  The patient has not had any further chest pain since his MI.  He reports a baseline exercise tolerance of 5 blocks, limited by fatigue. The patinet was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 614**] on [**12-18**], after presenting with complaints of N/V x 1 day.  The patients wife was [**Name2 (NI) 7359**] admitted a few days prior with similar GI symptoms, and was diagnosed with viral gasteroenteritis.  On presentation the patient was found to be hypotensive in the 80s, febrile to 102.9, was treated with IVF, and one dose of CTX/azythro.  The patinet denies any diahrea or bloody stool. He had continued n/v, fever, and mild abdominal discomfort.  He was given continued IVF for supportive care in treatment of presumed viral gastroenteritis.  His chest XR on admission was unremarkable, and he was satting on 96% on RA. On the evening of [**12-20**] at the OSH, the patient developed acute shortness of breath.  A CXR was obtained, which was concerning to the team for infiltrates.  He was reportedly started on CXR/Azythro, but no documentation is available that he received those antibiotics.  he denies any recent productive cough. Blood cultures were also obtained.  In this setting, the patient had ocmplaints of chest pain, similar, but less intense than prior MI.  Described chest discomfort as sub-sternal chest pressure, scaled to [**5-13**], radiation to the shoulder.  This chest discomfort was relieved with SLNG.  An EKG was obtained, which was concerning of a question of lateral ST depressions, and cardiac markers were elevated.  The patient was started in heparin, palvix, ASA, and metprolol, and was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization. While being transported, the patient had continued chest pain, which again was relieved with SLNG.  He has been chest pain free since.  In the holding area, the patient had continued hypoxia, requiring 100% NRB.  He continued to be febrile, spiking a temperature of 101.6  Cardiac catheterization was deffered, and the patient was admitted to the CCU for futher care. On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. Cardiac review of systems is notable for the absence paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
88 yo f with PMH of atrial fibrillation and HTN presented to the ED on [**3151-3-25**] with failure to thrive. According to patient's daughter, patient with increased fatigue and sleepiness x 2 days with associated worsening mobility x 1 day. Patient's daughter then called the geriatrics on-call attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1584**] who recommended that she come into the ED. Upon admission to the ED, patient had a fever to 100.1 and was given tylenol. She was given 1L NS as patient looked very dry. She was admitted to the medicine service. . Initially, she was noted to have low grade temps, left hip pain and leukocytosis. Given previous hip replacements, ortho was consulted. Initial XR showed no fracture. Ortho recommended ultrasound of hip and US guided arthrocentesis. LENIs showed no DVT but flattening of the waveform suggsting more proximal obstruction. US hip showed mostly solid 4 cm hematoma extending anteriorly from the femoral prosthesis to the proximal femoral diaphysis with no definite signs of abscess. . Over the next two days, she triggered on [**3-26**] for rigoring, temp to 102, and hypertension. Her abx were broadened to include vancomycin and zosyn. She triggered again on [**3-27**] for BP 79/48 and HR 120, and was bolused with fluids with improved BP to 90's. Initial blood cultures were negative, but repeat cultures on [**3-26**] were noted to be growing 4/4 bottles with GPC's in pairs and chains. She received a total of about 1.5 liters of fluid on the floor. Given possibility of sepsis, she was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring and treatment despite DNR/DNI. .

She feels generally "unwell" but is mildly disoriented as is ber baseline by report. She is unwilling to provide further ROS.
HPI: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7366**] is a 75 year old man with history of Atrail Fibrillation on Coumadin and transfusion-dependent MDS (baseline Hct 25-28) who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] from his hematologist's office when he was discovered to have a history of [**5-8**] days of melena and associated anemia. He describes having dark bowel movements once daily for the past 4-5 days; his last dark BM was on the day prior to admission. (At baseline he has one well-formed BM daily.) He describes feeling fatigued and very short of breath for two days prior to admission, with dyspnea with "any movement," relieved by lying still. He denies experiencing chest pain, palpitations, headache, lightheadedness, n/v, diaphoresis, abdominal pain or abdominal cramping, dyspepsia, or fever during this time period. He denies NSAID use. His appetite has been stable. He has no prior history of melena, BRBPR, or hematemesis, but notes that he has 1-2 episodes per week of coughing blood related to his postnasal drip.  On presentation to his hematologist's office on the day of admission, his hematocrit was found to be 18.7 and he was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]. In the ED he received 4 units PRBC, 4 units FFP, and Vit. K and transferred to the MICU. On the following day ([**2-15**]) he underwent EGD where he had multiple findings (see below) including a single linear ulcer at gastroesophageal junction with stigmata of recent bleeding but no active bleeding, as well as 2 AVMs in the stomach fundus.  He has no previous history of PUD or gastritis. He does report a past history of acid reflux at night, which he has not experienced since he stopped eating late-night meals 2 years ago.
59M h/o coronary artery vasospasm, minimal CAD (Cath [**2791**]) S/P ICD placement for VF arrest ([**2788**]) presented to [**Hospital 5796**] hospital with SSCP.  His chest pain woke him from sleep at 2am, he walked around and it did not resolve.  It was accompanied by sweating and some SOB.  He went to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5796**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and was given NTG, his pain did not resolve and he was transferred here for possible cardiac catheterization. A CXR at [**Location (un) 5796**] indicated a widened mediastinum, a CT to evaluate for aortic disection was planned, but held due to a Creatinine of 2.6.

This is an 81 year old male with PMH of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF=25% on his last ECHO [**8-23**], ESRD on HD with related anemia, HTN, h/o of prostate cancer s/p radical prostatectomy in 2/94, and secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism who presented for an elective subtotal parathyroidectomy in the setting of remarkably elevated PTH levels documented since [**3338**], failure of medical management due to patient compliance issues, and development of renal osteodystrophy.  His peak PTH level was 1498 (normal 15-65) in [**1-24**] and his PTH on admission was 999.  He also has renal osteodystrophy with imaging notable for a Rugger-Jersey spine. He has been on HD for the last 14 years through an AV fistula in his left arm. On arrival to the ICU, his initial vitals were T: 95.3, BP: 228/95, P: 104, R: 10, and O2: 100% on 2L NC.  The patient was extremely lethargic, but was able to relay that he had a headache and central chest pain.  The surgery team transferred the patient for closer monitoring given his multiple medical comorbidities s/p a subtotal parathyroidectomy of his right thyroid lobe with no significant blood loss.  He arrived extubated and fatigued with a PIV in place from the OR for IVF administration as well as a femoral A-line for BP monitoring. HE received about 1 Liter of fluid intra/post-op.  It was also recommended that he recieve no blood thinners given his recent surgery to a hypervascular area. Review of sytems: Patient endorses headache and chest pain, the remainder of ROS was limited by lethargy and inattentiveness.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is an 81M with dilated cardiomyopathy EF 25%, ESRD on HD, and HTN recently admitted [**Date range (1) 7411**] for hungry bone syndrome s/p parathyroidectomy. He was discharged to [**Hospital3 2520**] [**Hospital3 **] and had been doing well with planned discharge this am. This am, he awoke with acute onset SOB and shaking chills associated with dry cough. He was noted to be tachycardic to 140s with BP 230/100. He was initially 96%RA then 92% on 2L NC but had been afebrile 98.9. He also reports weight gain 64kg from dry weight 59kg and had bilateral hand numbness during episode now resolved. Denies recent dietary indiscretion or CP. He was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further eval. In our ED, initial vs were: T102 P135 BP 221/126 R 40 O2 sat100% on 100%NRB. He triggered for respiratory distress. Patient was given SL NTG, started on BIPAP for presumed CHF/volume overload but also received 500cc bolus. CXR was consistent with multifocal PNA so he was given Vanco 1g, Zosyn 2.25g and tylenol 650mg and placed on NRB instead of BiPap with sats 100% on NRB. Due to difficult access, left femoral line placed. In the ICU, he reports SOB improved with no further chills or rigors. Still complaining of dry cough. Review of sytems: (+) Per HPI.

Pt presented [**1-9**] with RLQ abd pain.  Per surgery note, pt reported he was in his usual state of health until 4 days prior to presentation when he purchased a bottle of wine and drank [**11-19**] of the bottle, followed by dull pain and tenderness in RLQ without radiation.  Pain persisted over the next four days, relatively unchanged, until the pt presented to his PCP for an urgent care visit on [**3347-1-9**]. During this time, he notes decreased appetite and loose stools 2-3x/day. He denies fevers, chills. He notes chronic SOB unchanged recently and denies chest pain. Pt was admitted to surgery service on [**1-9**], had a CT of abd, which showed a perforated appendix with possible early abscess formation.  He was started on hep sq, cipro, and flagyl, and medically managed on surgery service. Transferred from [**Hospital Ward Name 1924**] 5 at 7pm from surgery service to medicine service.  HR upon transfer 100, sbp ~100, 2l oxygen. Around 2200, staff noticed pt "not looking good," hr rose to 120-130s, pt diuresed 10mg iv lasix, bp dropped from 110/60 to 96/56 to 92/58, remained on 2L.  Also received one albuterol neb, ipratropium neb, and PO ativan for concern for ethanol withdrawal.  EKG showed rapid rate at 130, likely afib, nl axis.
This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p wedge resection, prostate ca s/p radiation and chemotherapy, new pancreatic mass likely IPMN, and recent admission for ruptured appendix treated medically who is admitted with hypernatremia, afib with RVR and respiratory distress. . The patient was admitted from [**1-10**] to [**1-25**] for RLQ pain found to be a ruptured appendicitis.  He was treated with medical management and has been on Cipro/Flagyl for antibiotic therapy since then. Of note, CT showed possible early abscess which was unchanged to slightly improved on repeat CT.  He was also found to have a R subclavian vein thrombosis at the site of a prior PICC line.  He has been on anticoagulation since that time.  He additionally had a tachycardia thought to most likely be MAT/sinus tach wtih APBs which was treated with IV and PO lopressor. . He had been doing well at [**Hospital 99**] Rehab, receiving IV Cipro/flagyl and was afebrile until [**1-31**].  At that time, he began to develop hypernatremia and hyperkalemia with worsening renal dysfunction.  He was then given decreased Na in his TPN and decreased his daily K supplement from 40 to 20 mEq daily. He was given Lovenox for his RUE DVT and coumadin was initiated on [**1-31**].  Per report, as his Na was increasing and his HR had increased with rates in the 140s with SBPs in the 80s, he was transferred to the ED for further management. . In the ED, initial VS were 98.8 140/102 114 92% on 4L NC.  BP decreased to 90s/40s up to 119/36 with IVF.

This is an 85 [**Hospital **] nursing home resident with a history of cerebrovascular accident, coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft who presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress.  The patient has been a nursing home resident for two years, is wheel chair bound times eight months prior to admission according to his son, had a fever and shortness of breath earlier the week prior to admission.  The patient was started on Levofloxacin on [**8-26**] at the nursing home and Flagyl was also added.  The morning prior to admission the patient was noted to have increased respiratory distress, diaphoretic, complaining of shortness of breath.  This was the morning of [**2585-8-30**].  The patient's O2 sats in the Emergency Room were found to be in the low 70s on 4 liters nasal cannula.  The patient was felt to be in severe respiratory distress and was intubated emergently in the Emergency Room.  According to the physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient was alert prior to intubation. Subsequently after intubation the patient's blood pressure decreased and the patient was started on Dopamine and his heart rate increased into the 150s.  The pressures were changed to Neosinephrine with significant decrease in blood pressure without any excessive tachycardia associated with it. The patient was given Vanco, Ceftriaxone, Flagyl in the Emergency Room.  An nasogastric lavage was performed in the Emergency Room, which was significant for coffee ground, which were OB positive.  The patient was also grossly OB positive from below. The patient was transferred to the MICU sedated, intubated with a left groin catheter.
Patient is an 80 yo male with no known significant CAD but history of HTN, CKD, COPD, restrictive lung disease by PFTs, severe emphysema radiographically, hx of active TB (treated in [**3340**]), and diastolic dysfunction documented on previous echocardiogram who presents with 4 day history of increasing dyspnea on exertion, lower extremity edema, and PND. Patient was recently an inpatient at [**Hospital1 18**] for left iliac artery aneurysm coiling. This hospital course was complicated by respiratory arrest and hypotension of unclear etiology, although per [**Name (NI) **] thought to be likely secondary to hypercarbic resp failure (although no ABGs demonstrate this). In the setting of this event the patient developed a RBBB which resolved over a short interval. Cardiology was consulted with reported recs of ASA, statin, Beta blocker and heparin drip. Per the patient's report, after discharge from the hospital his respiratory symptoms were relatively improved from his baseline, although he had developed bilateral lower extremity edema which was new. This past friday, the patient was seen by a VNA nurse who heard crackles on lung exam and doubled his home lasix from 20mg PO qd to 40mg PO. Despite this intervention, the following day the patient developed symptoms of PND. Over the course of a few days the patient has been having worsening respiratory symptoms, ultimately necessitating a visit to the E.D. today. He denies any recent URI symptoms, chest pain, diaphoresis, N/V, increasing sputum production, or F/C. The patient reports he has been compliant with his medications and denies any significant change in his diet. . In the ED the patient was assessed and thought to be in decompensated CHF. The patient was given 80mg Lasix x1, 40mg x 1 and nitro gtt for BP control. The patient was placed on BIPAP ([**9-26**]), 50% Fi02. The patient diuresed 1800cc in 12 hours in the ED. The patient was temporarily weaned from BIPAP but had subsequent desat to low 80's, requiring replacement of mask. CCU transfer was requested by ED attending at this point. . Allergies: NKDA

79 year-old female with history of sarcoidosis, moderate pulmonary hypertension, ILD, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who presents with acute on chronic dyspnea.  She is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient and was last seen by him on [**2706-6-8**]; at that time, she was doing well, satting 95% on 4L at rest. Her recent history is notable for an admission at the end of [**2706-3-18**] where she presented with worsening dyspnea, ruled out for PE, and was transitioned from prednisone to sildenafil.  She has seen Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the interim and started on lasix for volume overload in the setting of right heart failure and prednisone-related fluid retention and weight gain.  As noted above, she was been doing well, using a stable amount of supplemental oxygen at home and able to ambulate several feet with only mild dyspnea. Two days prior to admission, however, she noted worsening dyspnea with exertion.  She also developed a nonproductive cough but denied sick contacts, fevers, chills, arthralgias, and chest pain.  Her symptoms worsened and she called Dr.[**Doctor Last Name **] office on the day of admission and was advised to present to the ED. In the ED, initial vs were: 98.1 141/53 73 26 84%4L. She was placed on a NRB with 100% o2 sat and given solumedrol 125 mg IV x 1.  A chest x-ray showed bilateral interstial infiltrates and she was admitted to the MICU for further management.

The patient is an 81-year-old man with a previously discovered left-sided hypogastric aneurysm with an endovascular repair with stent graft and outflow vessel coiling in [**3353-12-23**]. He was admitted for symptoms of fever and tenderness of the abdomen over the area of the aneurysm. During the course of his hospitalization, he became febrile, and a CAT scan showed an increase in the already very large aneurysm causing GI symptoms including hematochezia, melena and guaiac-positive stools. Due to the increasing size of the aneurysm and the possibility for infection and rupture, he was taken for aneurysm repair. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room where he remained stable and successfully underwent a hypogastric aneurysm repair. The ureter was encased in the aneurysm sac and had to be transected to allow access to the deep feeding vessels. It was reconstructed over a stent. There was no evidence of bowel fistula or infection of the aneurysm itself. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit where he remained intubated for several days. During this time, he developed an episode of acute renal failure. He slowly had resolution of his renal function to a baseline [**Known patient lastname **] with a creatinine of 1.6. He was eventually extubated but continued to have high oxygen demands. He subsequently taken to the VICU where continued respiratory support measures were taken. He continued to have respiratory difficulty and was dependent upon supplemental oxygen via shovel mask; however, his oxygen requirements continued to decrease with aggressive chest therapy, deep breathing exercised, incentive spirometry and immobilization with physical therapy. On the morning of postoperative day #21, the patient was in the chair and asked to come back with the help of the nursing staff and physical therapy. Upon moving back to the bed, he suffered an acute respiratory arrest and was found in PEA and quickly became asystolic. Following several minutes of ACLS resuscitative efforts including 3 rounds of epinephrine, his pulse was regained. He was intubated emergently at this time and was taken immediately to the intensive care unit. It was thought that the most probable diagnosis at this time was pulmonary embolism; however, given his previous history of renal insufficiency, the decision was made not to proceed with CT pulmonary angiogram but rather to empirically treat pulmonary embolism with high-dose heparin, which was initiated at the time of the code.It should be noted that throughout his whole course he was on 5000u SQ heparin TID. A transesophageal echocardiogram at this time showed dilated left ventricle and inferior vena cava with a left ventricular ejection fraction from 30%-50%. This was in contrast with a preoperative study showing an ejection fraction of 15%. He was extubated following 2 days of ICU care and was able to maintain his airway for roughly 12 hours; however, after this time, he was showing significant signs of respiratory distress and tiring and was electively intubated.In addition since he had a limited UE DVT at the brachial vein he was continued on heparin. Following the initial code event, a stat CT of his head was also obtained to evaluate his neurologic status; however, this showed no acute abnormalities. At the time of discharge, the patient was critically ill but stable. DISCHARGE REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Neurologic: He is found to be neurologically intact and conversant at the time of short extubation. Currently his is moving all 4 extremities to command and opening his eyes. He was lightly sedated on propofol and Ativan. Cardiovascular: The patient has no acute cardiovascular issues. He is maintaining his outflow pressures and the range of 95-110 mmHg. He is not requiring any vasoactive medication. Pulmonary: He is orally intubated and seemed to be 40%, rate of 20, with a 12 of PEEP. He has been maintaining good saturations of 95%-100%. GI: A Dobbhoff feeding tube was placed, and the patient is tolerating tube feeds to goal. He is receiving Protonix prophylaxis. GU: The patient appears to have suffered another renal insult with creatinine [**Known patient lastname 7590**] climbing to 2.6; however, he continues to make urine at the rate of 20-25 cc/hr. The plan for this will be to followup closely. FEN: He has no electrolyte abnormalities. Heme: He is stable on heparin drip at 400 U/hr for goals of PTT between 60 and 80. The plan will
The patient is an 85 year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and radiation proctitis who presents with bright red blood per rectum on the morning of admission.  The patient had a bloody bowel movement in his diaper at his nursing home and needed to be changed four times since that morning.  His blood pressure was 110/60 and a heart rate of 70 in the field.  The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation.  In the Emergency Department the patient was given two large bore intravenouses and he was given intravenous fluids.  Gastrointestinal bleed scan was attempted and there was no clear evidence of a gastrointestinal bleed.  Of note during the bleeding scan the patient's blood pressure dropped to the 70s and 80s and the patient was transferred back to the Emergency Department before the scan could be officially completed.  The patient was asymptomatic throughout.
The patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple vascular risk factors including several prior strokes, who presents to the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of left sided weakness.  Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was in his usual state of health.  Per wife, his doctor had given him a good checkup and felt that at about midnight, he was awoke and he noted the sudden onset of left sided weakness in his arm, leg, and face.  He had no sensory changes at this time.  His wife reports that he was able to see and respond to things on the left side of his face. Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] did not have a headache, and does not have one now.  There was no change in his level of consciousness.

His wife noticed increasing edema and abdominal girth approximately 1 month ago. He saw his outpatient cardiologist who increased his Torsemide dose from 100 to 150 mg PO daily. Approximately 2 weeks ago, his wife again noticed increasing abdominal girth and firmness as well, associated with decreasing urine output. His cardiologist again increased his Torsemide dose to 200 mg PO daily on week ago. His edema and decreased urine output continued to progress, and he began to develop scrotal edema. Two days prior to admission he was prescribed metolazone 5 mg to be taken prior to dosing Torsemide. However, he did not receive this medication. At this point he had urinary retention, and his wife brought him to the emergency department. Review of his medications from OMR revealed that he had been prescribed Tamsulosin for BPH but he was not taking this medication. In the ED, initial VS T 97.5 HR 62 BP 99/49 RR 20 SaO2 96% on RA. His creatinine was 2.6 which was an increase above his baseline of 1.5-2. A Foley was placed, >600 mL of urine was drained. A CXR showed vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions left>right. An EKG showed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of 63, RBBB, LAFB, unchanged from prior EKG. Bedside US showed bilateral pleural effusions. Abdominal U/S showed free fluid and no hydronephrosis, but scrotal fluid. He was not given diuretics initially because of his elevated creatinine. During admission to medicine service, he was given furosemide 40 mg IV with good response. However, on the following day, he failed to respond to furosedmie 40mg IV, so the dose was repeated. The following day, he also received furosedmie 40 mg IV BID. His fluid balance was even over these two days. The next day, he was given furosemide 80mg IV in the AM, 2.5 mg metolazone followed by furosemide 100mg IV in the late afternoon. In the evening, he triggered for worsening shortness of breath. He was given metolazone 5 mg with furosemide 140 mg IV around 11pm. He was also given his nebulizers and one dose of Solumedrol for possible COPD exacerbation. His O2 sats remained >95% on [**2-6**] L/min O2. His CXR at that time showed bilateral plueral effusions and vascular congestion. His net fluid balance was negative 200 cc that day. Of note he also had two episodes of hypoglycemia to 40s overnight accompanied by tachypnea and wheezing; his respiratory symptoms resolved with euglycemia. His dose of insulin had been decreased earlier that day because of decreasing PO intake. His symptoms and hypoglycemia resolved with dextrose. His insulin was further decreased to NPH 10 units QAM and 5 units QPM with sliding scale. In the morning, he again triggered for RR >30 and cardiology was consulted. Patient was transferred to cardiology service for further management.

In the ED the patient received ASA, Plavix 75mg, Lipitor 80mg. A heparin gtt was not started given initial concern for GI bleeding and impression that symptoms were not escalating to suggest ACS. A beta blocker was not administered given history of significant bronchospasm (Dilt as outpatient).
The pt is an 82yo male PMHx COPD, Systolic CHF (EF25%). The pt is a poor historian but he felt short of breath for several days--he is not sure how long. He also endorsed a productive cough with green sputum and subjective fevers. He is not sure about dysuria/frequency. Few days before the admission, he suffered a mechanical fall, after which he developed the cough w/ sputum, subj fevers. In the ED, initial VS were: 101.1 89 112/55 18 97% RA. Due to a pressure of 89/51, he was given 1L of IVF. A rll infiltrate was found. His ua showed evidence of a uti. He was treated with iv levofloxacin, ctx, and vancomycin.  The pt was admitted to the MICU on [**2531-12-5**] and underwent treatment for HCAP/CAP and COPD exacerbation w IV prednisone, levofloxacin, vancomycin, zosyn, with improvement in respiratory status. In last 36 hrs in the MICU, pt's sbps were better (in the low 100s), remained afebrile, and his wheezing improved w/ nebs/steroids. He is due for a video swallow on [**Year (4 digits) **]. Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.

The patient was previously admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**12-5**] - [**12-12**] for community acquired pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, and heart failure exacerbation.  He was noted to have bilateral infiltrates and has a history of MRSA, and was treated with Vancomycin IV, Ceftriaxone po, Prednisone taper x12 days.  His Lasix was decreased from 40 mg daily prior to admission to 20 mg daily on discharge for acute renal failure, and Losartan was held at time of discharge due to the elevated creatinine.  His prior hospital course was complicated by dysphagia and concerns for aspiration.  He was discharged to [**Hospital1 593**] of [**Location (un) 55**] on Vancomycin IV through a right double lumen PICC, Ceftriaxone po, and a 12 day Prednisone taper.  Around [**12-26**], he was started on a 7 day course of Flagyl.  Per ED documentation, the patient then developed symptoms consistent with a CHF exacerbation on [**12-30**] and was diuresed with Torsemide [**Hospital1 **].  However, he continued to be short of breath and wheezing, and was started on Prednisone again on [**1-1**].  The day prior to transfer at his rehabilitation facility, the patient was noted to be lethargic and fatigued.

A CXR was obtained and he was given a dose of Vancomycin IV and Zosyn IV empirically.  He received 250cc and 500cc boluses of NS for a total of [**12-2**].5L with appropriate increases in blood pressure and urine output, but blood pressures subsequently decreased back to the 80's systolic.  He was started on Levophed 0.3 through his right PICC, as he declined a central line placement in the ED, and SBP were 110's.  Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV was given for hypotension without significant improvement in blood pressure.    Although the patient denies history of shortness of breath currently, he was reported to endorse dyspnea on intial presentation to the ED and was placed on oxygen 2L NC.  He was admitted to the MICU for hypotension and hypoxia in the low to mid 90's on 2L NC. . On arrival to the MICU, the patient was breathing comfortably and denied any complaints including pain, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, lightheadedness, chest pain, or other symptoms.  He did report feeling very tired and fatigued.

52 yo M with h/o coronary artery disease s/p PCI who presented with chest pain.
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] is an 87-year-old female Jehovah's Witness with a significant cardiovascular history who was diagnosed with a poorly differentiated carcinoma in the left colon after presenting with a hematocrit of 10. Preoperative staging with a CT scan revealed a large mass in the transverse colon and possible pulmonary nodules. Because of the profound nature of the anemia induced by the tumor,surgical resection was indicated even in the face of metastasis. She was referred to  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1105**], evaluated, and scheduled for surgical resection of the mass.
The patient is a 77 year old female admitted on [**2895-6-10**] status post a mechanical fall while out shopping and found to have a left femoral neck fracture.  In the Emergency Department the patient was noted to have a blood pressure of 60/palpable for several hours without intervention.  The patient was given aggressive intravenous fluids, approximately 6 liters.  The patient was also in atrial fibrillation on Coumadin with INR of 3.8, heartrate 110.  Blood pressure increased to the 80s systolic with wide open intravenous fluids.  Right femoral line was placed in the Emergency Department which was complicated by several arterial sticks.  Chest x-ray was suggestive of congestive heart failure.  Following 6 liters of intravenous fluid the patient was started on Dopamine drip to maintain systolic blood pressure of 90 which was later changed to Dobutamine.  A computerized tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a right pleural effusion, distended gallbladder with a small amount of ascites with mesenteric draining but no evidence of abdominal or retroperitoneal bleed.  The patient's electrocardiogram was notable for ST elevation and right-sided V4 leads consistent with intravenous involving infarct.  Troponin was elevated at 22. The patient was initially admitted to the Coronary Care Unit with presumed cardiogenic shock secondary to right ventricular infarct. SUMMARY OF MEDICINE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT STAY:  The patient was maintained on a Dobutamine drip to maintain blood pressure.  The patient's elevated INR was partially reversed with Vitamin K.  A bedside echocardiogram showed intravenous hypokinesis and septal flattening and no evidence of pericardial effusion or tamponade.  The patient with prerenal less than 1 and decreased urine output which was supported with intravenous fluid boluses.  On [**6-13**] the patient was febrile to 101.4.  On [**6-14**] the patient was weaned off of the Dobutamine.  Urinalysis was positive for enterococcus urinary tract infection and she was started on Vancomycin and was later switched to Levaquin once sensitivities returned.  The patient was also started on Lovenox and Coumadin for anticoagulation for her atrial fibrillation with her hip fracture.  The patient was also noted to have increased in lethargy secondary to narcotics she received for pain control as well as Ativan.  With minimization of narcotics            the patient's mental status started to clear.  The patient is still somnolent. The patient started taking p.o. on [**6-15**].
This patient is a 62 year-old female recently admitted to [**Hospital1 **] House with psychosis who complains of shortness of breath in the absence of chest pain on the morning of admission.  She was noted to have a decreased O2 sat of 90% on room air.  She was incontinent of noted to be bloody.  She was treated with Albuterol nebs in route and upon presentation to the Emergency Department had an O2 saturation improved to 97% on room air.  She was still short of breath with minimal exertion and had rales on her examination and pedal edema.  She was treated with IV Lasix and apparently improved.  While sitting in the Emergency Department the patient spiked a temperature to 101.9 and vomit.  NG lavage showed no fresh blood only old maroon material, which cleared after 1 liter of lavage.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable and was admitted for further workup.
This 86 year old man with h/o Afib(on warfarin), CHF, CAD(s/p AMI '[**62**]), and PVD, developed a fever 1 wk prior to admission, and since his primary physician had relocated, he opted to treat himself with amoxicillin 1000 mg tid, using pills that he kept for dental procedures.  His fever resolved, but he developed myalgias and arthralgias as well as increasing dyspnea.  He presented to the ED and an echocardiogram on [**7-15**] revealed a large pericardial effusion, EF-30%, most of fluid in posterior. region. Tamponade physiology. Pulsus 22-25.  Pt. went to OR for pericardial window, approx. 1 liter of blood tinged fluid was drained(gram stain neg./prelim. cx neg for malignant cells). Pt was extubated on [**7-17**], without incident.
Pt. is an 86 yo male with h/o chronic afib, cad, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] ([**Date range (1) 7066**]) s/p pericardial window for tamponade. Pt. was discharged to the [**Hospital 38**] Rehab. facility where after spending less then 24 hours at the facility he began experiencing increasing SOB with oxygen sats dropping into the 80's on room air.  The pt. required NRB and at the ED his oxygen sats improved on BIPAP.  CXR showed mild failure, B/L effusions R>L, and no ischemic ECG changes. He got 50 mg IV ethacrynic acid in ED. He spiked a fever of 102 and levofloxacin was started in the ED. Repeat ECHO in ED was unchanged from the one at discharge. Admitted to CCU for diuresis and close monitoring.

On initial evaluation by ED resident, vitals were as follows: Tm 102.8 PR 95 89/50 24 92%RA.  She was answering questions appropriately, noted to have tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant and suprapubic area.  UA was grossly positive.  Portable CXR showed fluffy bilateral infiltrate and mild cephalization.  CT abdomen/pelvis showed no intra-abdominal pathology but confirmed RLL pneumonia ?secondary to aspiration, for which she was given a dose of IV vancomycin, Zosyn, and levofloxacin. [**Hospital **] pressure dropped as low as 70s/50s for which she was given 500cc IVFs x2 to which her [**Hospital **] pressure responded well.  She has also received an extra 500cc IVFs with antibiotics.  EKG showed NSR at rate 90, LAD, normal intervals, TWI III, TWF avF V3.  Vitals in ED prior to transfer: HR 102 128/57 RR 20 100% on 15L face mask.  Prior to transfer pt began to feel increased rattling in back of throat and increased shortness of breath; she was placed on BiPap prior to transfer due to concern for flash pulmonary edema from fluid administration. . On the floor, patient presents on non-rebreather mask.  She reports having no pain.
The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of vascular disease thought to be secondary to mantle radiation therapy to the chest in [**2896**] for Hodgkin's disease, CAD s/p PTCA of LCx in [**6-27**], bilateral subclavian stenosis s/p stents, left carotid endarterectomy who presented with a 1 day history of chest tightness and weakness while exercising.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8680**] is an 87-yo man with history of colon cancer (refusing treatment), PAF, CHF with chronic pleural effusions who presented with lower extremity weakness and was found to be hypoxic with O2 sat in the 80s requiring NRB and MICU admission. . The patient was mostly recently admitted on [**3172-4-21**] for hypotension likely from dehydration. He was given IVF and was discharged on [**3172-4-22**] with amox-clav for UTI. A day later, on the day of this admission, he felt as if his legs were "rubbery" and that he had difficulty ambulating even with his walker. He denies dyspnea, chest pain, lightheadedness, or worsening of his leg edema. He denies fevers, chills, coughs, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipatin, dysuria. . On arrival to the ED, T 101.2, BP 117/50, HR 76, RR 22, 89%RA. His CEs were negative x 1. CXR revealed worsening R pleural effusion. He received 1 liter NS, ceftriaxone 2 grams, levofloxacin 750 mg. Due to his hypoxia, he required NRB and was admitted to the MICU for further management.
87 male with history of untreated colon cancer, PAF (not on anticoagulation), recent hospitalization for hypoxia, weakness and a UTI who presents with ongoing weakness and diarrhea. He was noted to be weak at home, and a friend urged him to activate his lifeline. He states that he has been having lots of diarrhea, roughly every two hours, since his last discharge. He has not been having any fevers, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or bleeding. . His last hospitalization concluded that his weakness was due to deconditioning, and his shortness of breath was due to fluid overload. He was treated with flagyl for two days last admission, and, and was discharged on Augmentin to complete a course for a UTI. He had a positive c.dif toxin noted in the computer last admission, but was not discharged on any treatment.

Mr. [**Known patient firstname **] [**Known patient lastname **] is an 86-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction in the 30% range, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, chronic renal insufficiency, hepatitis C, liver cirrhosis, who presented to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with fever and hypotension on [**3186-7-9**]. The patient was transfused at the [**Hospital6 8754**] approximately two days prior to admission for chronic anemia of uncertain etiology, according to the patient's family.  The day following transfusion, the patient was in his usual state of health.  The morning of admission, at 1 A.M., the patient began to have rigors and a fever at home.  The patient's family describes a fever to 38.5 degrees Celsius in the early morning hours.  The patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, dysuria, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  He has chronic abdominal pain.  It was unclear whether there were any changes in this abdominal pain. Additionally, the patient did not complain of headache or neck stiffness. In the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Room, the patient was afebrile and initially had a blood pressure in the 110 range, but became progressively hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s, as well as a temperature spike to 102 degrees Farenheit, and oxygen saturation in the 90s. On physical examination in the Emergency Room, there was noted to be right upper quadrant as well as left lower quadrant tenderness without rebound or guarding.  It was unclear in discussion with the patient's family whether this was actually a change for him.  The patient was noted to have a white count of 17.8, with a left shift and 1 band form. The chest x-ray, urinalysis and blood cultures were performed.  Chest x-ray failed to demonstrate infiltrates. Urinalysis demonstrated evidence of urinary tract infection. The patient was given ampicillin, levofloxacin and Flagyl. The patient's daughter, acting as his health care proxy, refused further workup including CT scan and lumbar puncture in the Emergency Room.  Additionally, the patient's family refused central venous access.  Therefore, in the Emergency Room, the patient was begun on dopamine via peripheral intravenous lines and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient is an 86 year-old man who was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 69**] in early [**3186-7-5**] and was found to have MSSA bacteremia.  At echocardiogram so the patient was started on Oxacillin intravenous for empiric treatment of SBE.  The patient was discharged to rehab with plans for a total six weeks of treatment with intravenous antibiotics.  The patient then returned to [**Hospital1 1426**] on [**3186-7-30**] feeling itchy with a rash over his extremities.  He also complained of a low grade fever, but denied any other symptoms on admission. myocardial infarction in [**3161**], coronary artery bypass graft in [**3185-6-4**].  2.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a Russian speaking gentleman who lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 86**].  Their daughter is a physician at [**Hospital6 **].  Both the patient and his wife are retired mathematicians. FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initially physical examination the patient had a temperature of 97.9, blood pressure 136/76, heart rate 76, respiratory rate 24 and oxygen saturation 95% on room air.  In general, he was an elderly gentleman appearing his stated age sleeping in no apparent distress. His mucous membranes are moist.  He had no lymphadenopathy or JVD.  His heart rhythm was irregular.  He had a normal S1 and S2.  There was a [**3-12**] holosystolic murmur at the upper sternal border bilaterally and there are no rubs or gallops.  He had scattered rhonchi bilaterally and pulmonary auscultation. His abdomen was mildly distended.  There was normoactive bowel sounds and there was mild left lower quadrant tenderness.  He had 2+ dorsalis pedis and radial pulses bilaterally.  His extremities were warm and there was no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  He had petechial lesions on his lower extremities greater in his upper extremities bilaterally. INITIAL LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 5.3, hematocrit 31.9, platelet count 222.  The differential demonstrates 60% neutrophils, 27% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, 6.6% eosinophils and .4% basophils.  His PT was 11.7, PTT 31.6, INR 0.9. Initial serum chemistries sodium 139, potassium 4.0, chloride 106, bicarb 16, BUN 60, creatinine 3.1, glucose 116.  ALT 28, AST 65, alkaline phosphatase 238, amylase 157, lipase 57, T bili 2.9. Given his mildly elevated liver enzymes an abdominal ultrasound was performed in the Emergency Department.  This study demonstrated no intrahepatic ductal dilatation, no hydronephrosis, a cholestic structure of the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe, gallstones, a small amount of ascites and a small right sided pleural effusion.  Chest x-ray demonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions and slight worsening congestive heart failure. IMPRESSION:  Given the patient's presentation with the petechial rash, low grade fevers, peripheral eosinophils, elevated serum creatinine and onset of symptoms ten to twelve days after Oxacillin was started the presumptive diagnosis was Oxacillin induced acute interstitial nephritis.  Urine eosinophils and a urine sodium were sent.  Given the recent increase in the patient's Furosemide dose from 20 to 40 the possibility of prerenal azotemia was considered and urine electrolytes were sent.  Given his acute renal failure the patient's Furosemide and Lisinopril were held, Oxacillin was discontinued and Levaquin was started.  Although the rash was most likely secondary to Oxacillin induced AIN, given the associated acute renal failure and low grade fever the possibility of vasculitis was considered and serum ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **] were sent.  Aside from the above the patient was continued on all of his outpatient medications. HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the evening of hospital day number two the
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 8776**] is a 66 yo F with a 6-month history of ulcer on her left 3rd toe.  She has been followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8777**] of podiatry in [**Location (un) **].  She reports that she last saw him three weeks ago and he thought her toe was improving.  Two weeks ago, she began to have increasing pain in her toe and instep, and noticed that her toe appeared darker.  Her cousin, with whom she lives, noticed her rubbing her toe frequently and encouraged her to see a doctor, but she did not.  One week ago, she noticed redness on the dorsal aspect of her foot.  She finally saw her podiatrist [**2-24**] and he sent her to the ED. She describes her pain as [**3-29**], in her 3rd toe and instep of her left foot.  Additionally, she complains of a stinging pain in her great toes bilaterally secondary to gouty arthritis.  She has remained afebrile.

This 59 year old white male has a history of severe COPD and aortic stenosis has had significant deterioration in his breathing over the past 6-9 months.  He started using oxygen at home 4 weeks prior to admission.  He underwent cardiac echo on [**3025-11-1**] which showed an EF of 60% and a bicuspid aortic valve with severely thickened and deformed leaflets and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 108**] of 0.7 cm2 and a peak gradient of 43 mmHg.  He is now admitted for cardiac cath prior to AVR.
62 yo Man with MMP including severe COPD on chronic high dose steroids, difficult to control AF, and AS s/p prosthetic valve replacement, presented with RLE pain. Pt had been in USOH when 10d prior to admission he was arising from a chair, felt a tugging sensation in his R hip, which over the next day developed into progressive pain. The pain decreased over two days, but then he noticed extensive ecchymoses on his RLE. No fall, no other trauma. No change in medications. Pt stated he always bruises easily and only takes baby ASA 81 mg twice a week because of increased bruising if he takes it more often. Pt also reported increased dyspnea at rest over the past 3 days. Denies f/c, changed cough, CP, n/v, or other sxs. He did have a chronic cough productive of thick, often bloody secretions. . In [**Name (NI) **] pt had an episode of rapid AF with HR to 130s, associated with diaphoresis and SOB, which resolved eventually after nebs and disopyramide were given. .
This is an 82-year-old gentleman with aortic valve replacement (St. [**Male First Name (un) 911**]), rheumatic heart disease and mitral stenosis with an ejection fraction of 50%, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, who awoke on the day of admission with substernal chest pain approximately [**6-19**].  He presented to the emergency room at an outside hospital where an EKG showed 1-[**Street Address(2) 1745**] elevations laterally in 1, L, V5 through V6 with concomitant ST depressions in the inferior leads.  The cardiology service was consulted and while evaluating the patient he was noted to go into polymorphic ventricular fibrillation.  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun and the patient was shocked at 360 joules.  He then became bradycardic, was given atropine 1 mg and an amiodarone drip was started and the patient was taken emergently to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory.  In the catheterization laboratory the patient was found to have normal left main, normal left anterior descending coronary artery, and a 20% proximal left circumflex coronary artery.  Of note, there was also an obtuse marginal #1 with very distal thrombotic occlusion with TIMI 1 flow.  The patient had a normal right coronary artery.  He was taken to the coronary care unit for monitoring. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting or palpitations.
Mr [**Known patient lastname 8814**] is an 85 y/o M with PMHx s/f CAD with multiple DES and BMS, HC, HTN, AFIB and PVD who presented on [**7-15**] after 1 day of shortness of breath and chest pain. On [**7-14**], he was helping his wife in the nursing home, walking with her and began feeling SOB and chest pain, which was unusual for him. He described cp as midline sub-sternal, without radiation.  No n/v, light headedness, syncope, PND, orthopnea. It continued to progress without improvement until yesterday when he was unable to sleep, and his son brought him to the [**Name (NI) **]. His prior coronary events have included symptoms of h/a, and chest pain. In the ED, initial vitals were stable (Temp: 97.7 HR: 76 BP: 121/67 Resp: 16 O(2)Sat: 95 Normal). EKG revealed Sinus, ST elevations in leadII andIII with reciprocal ST depressions anteriorly, new from previous. He was determined to have NSTEMI. Labs and imaging significant for: CE CK-MB 11 (8a, 3a), Trop-T 0.45 (8a), 0.46 (3a) H/H 9.4/30.8 Lytes: K 3.9, Mg 2.3 UA: RBC 24 Patient was given plavix loading dose. On arrival to the floor, patient was in no acute distress and chest pain free.  He was subsequently started on heparin gtt and nitro gtt in preparation for [**7-18**] cath.  Over the course of the 23rd, the patient was noted to be increasingly hypoxic with O2 sats ~85% on 4-6L O2 NC.  He was triggered and given lasix 40 x 2 with minimal urine output or improvement in respiratory status.  Trops increased to 0.67 at [**2654**].  Repeat EKG was markedly improved from admission with q waves in III, AvF and small ST deppression in I and V3. ABG was 7.38/44/66.  CXR showed pulmonary edema.  Subjective improvement in respiratory status was noted with duonebs x 3. However, given his continued worsened respiratory status he was transferred to CCU.
83 y/o M with h/o COPD, asbestos exposure, p/w 1 week of URI symptoms(sneeze, cough, congestion), and worsening SOB for a couple of months. Denies fever, chills, chest pain, or palpitations. Does perfer not to lie flat, uses [**12-9**] pillows, but won't endorse orthopnea per se. He called his PCP who recommended he go to the ED. He came by ambulance. . In the ED, he was afebrile and normotensive, RR 20s, initially 98s on NRB which was started by EMS. He was placed on 40% FM, satting low 90s. Initially very wheezy, thought COPD exacerbation, and was given continuous nebs and prednisone 60mg PO x 1. CXR revealed b/l infiltrates consistent with either pulm edema vs multifocal pneumonia. He was given CTX/Azithro for CAP followed by Levofloxacin for double coverage by protocol. He got up to go to the bathroom and desatted to the 70s, so was placed on a Bipap. His BP remained 120-170 systolic, so was given lasix 20mg IV x 1 (lasix naive).
Patient reports increasing SOB and DOE x few days.  He has a baseline DOE, which has acutely worsened x 48 hours.  He initially presented to the [**Location (un) 614**] ED and was found to be incomplete heart block.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup and management. . In ED: Temp Pacer wire was placed via R IJ under fluoro.
63 y/o male with recent episode of s. viridans endocarditis in [**2572-9-26**]. Since that time he has completed a course of IV antibiotics and extensive dental work. Follow-up echo showed severe mitral regurgitation and he has also developed atrial fibrillation. He conitnues to have dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath along with 2 pillow orthopnea.
Mr [**Known patient lastname **] is a 63 year old gentleman with recent CABG x 2 and MVR (OnX mechanical valve)/ MAZE/PFO closure admitted for hypotension and bradycardia s/p DC cardioversion for aflutter/atach. Per [**Name (NI) **], pt was recently admitted in [**2573-3-27**] for subtherapeutic INR. During that admission, he was found to be in aflutter. At that time he was on Toprol Xl and amiodarone. Per the patient, amiodarone was then discontinued. Given his multiple recent surgeries, DC cardioversion was thought to be the best option for rhythm control. The patient himself has not had symptoms of tachycardia, no CP, no SOB. . The patient underwent DC cardioversion with sedation. He then became hypotensive and was bradycardic in a junctional rythm. He was placed on dopamine and recovered his blood pressure. He was subsequently admitted to the ICU for observation. Currently he states that he felt dizzy after cardioversion, but now feels well.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8893**] is a 79yo Cantonese man (nonverbal at baseline) with h/o severe dementia, several aspiration pnas, frequent UTIs who was recently discharged from our hospital in [**Month (only) 354**] during which time he was treated for Cdiff, UTI with yeast, and aspiration pna with Zosyn. He presents today from his nursing home with shortness of breath and dark urine. According to the patient's grandson, who saw him yesterday, he looks much worse today than he did at that time. He just finished treatment for Cdiff with flagyl and po vanco, which was just stopped and by report diarrhea worsened after discontinuing. It is also unclear by his records whether he remains on or has just stopped zosyn and vanco iv for aspiration pna. Culture data in our computer is unrevealing except for urine repeatedly positive for yeast. . On arrival to our ER he was found to have new hypernatremia to 159 and to be tachycardic between 114-150 (last d/c summary shows pt was tachycardic from 90s-110s throughout entire last admission). He had O2 sat 81% on RA and required nonrebreather mask in the ER for O2 sat 100%. His white count was 20, which is stable from his last admission. He was given vancomycin 1g iv, levofloxacin 500mg and flagyl 500mg. He was started on D5 1/2NS at 150cc/hr. Blood and urine cultures were sent. . After a long discussion with his family (by the ER resident, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) they decided to continue his DNR/DNI status but otherwise want him treated as needed. They will revisit this after seeing if he stabilizes in a few days (versus possible change to CMO). He was admitted to the ICU for increased nursing needs.
59 yo female transferred in from OSH with one week history of neck and hip pain with ? fever/chills. Acute nausea/vomiting/SOB evening prior to admission and went to local ER. She presented in respiratory distress and was intubated there prior to being trasnferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ER.
Pt is a 53 yo W with no significant PMH who presented to her PCP yesterday with 2 week hx of DOE. Pt was concerned she had pneumonia but denied fever, chill, productive cough or URI symptoms. VS at PCP's office were BP 180/104, HR 104, 97% RA. Pt was sent home with metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and plan for stress ECHO the following day. Upon arrival to stress lab, pt's BP was elevated to systolic 230. She was sent directly to the ED for further evaluation. There she complained of HA and nausea. She denied visual changes, chest pain, palpitations, back pain, abdominal. She did report diaphoresis. Initial VS's were: T98.9, HR110, 239/139, RR16 97 . Patient was started on nitro gtt with no improvement in BP despite max dose of nitro. She was then switched to labetalol gtt with improvement in BP to 159/97. Pt developed progressive respiratory distress with exam notable for crackles [**11-24**] way up posteriorly. Patient received lasix 40mg IV x1 and was started on BIPAP, which was d/c'd after patient vomited into the mask. She was then placed on NRB. She also received zofran, ativan. Initial labs notable for BUN/Cr 27/1.2, proBNP of 10,933, CK 104, MB 4, Tn-T 0.02. She was transferred to the CCU for further management. On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
64 y/o M with CAD s/p CABG x 2 and ruptured chordae tendinae s/p mechanical mitral valve placement in [**1-2**] admitted to the neurosurgical service on [**2-16**] for emergent evacuation of left subdural hematoma (surgery on [**2-16**]) after falling and hitting his head on the ice two days prior. Anticoagulation was reversed with FFP and vitamin K. He did well postoperatively and a heparin bridge was begun on [**2-21**], followed by the addition of coumadin on [**2-24**]. His INR (1.7) has yet to become therapeutic (2.5-3.5).
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9049**] is a 76 year-old female with a complicated PMHx that includes CAD s/p Lcx stenting, DM type 2, s/p dual pacemaker placement for bradycardia, atrial fibrillation on chronic Coumadin therapy, with severe PVD s/p multiple stents, angioplasties and atherectomies, with claudication symptoms. She recently developed a RLE ulcer, and was referred for RLE angiography and PTCA of her right tibial anterior tibial artery. One hour after the procedure, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9049**] became hypotensive with SBP down to 30s when the sheath was pulled, HR paced at 60. She also complained of severe right groin pain at the cath site. She was given Atropine X 2, IVF bolus, and transfused 2 units of PRBCs. Her HR subsequently increased to 120s, then she went into atrial fibrillation with RVR in 160s. She spontaneously converted back to NSR with HR 88. Her BP improved with the above resuscitation measures, and she was trasnferred to the CCU for further management and care. An emergent CT scan was performed on arrival to CCU, which revealed a right-sided RP bleed.
78 year old man with multiple medical problems including CAD s/p recent RCA Taxil stent [**2-24**], AF and sick sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker in [**4-26**] revised in [**5-27**], CHF with EF 45% recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 9070**] for atypical chest pain (no interventions) comes in this AM for elective cardiac cath to evaluate for restrictive cardiomyopathy.  During the procedure his pressures dropped from the 130s/80s to sbp of 70s, he also was somnolent (?due to versed and fentanyl).  He was not responsive to atropine, or to low doses of dopamine, but responded to 15mcg/kg/min of dopamine.  EKG not consistent with ischemia, no other s/s.  The patient was admitted to the CCU for close monitoring. Given his symmetric LVH, diseases such as sarcoid and amyloid were possible but pt has not wanted a biopsy to date.  An ECHO earlier this month showed severe symmetric LVH, inferior and septal hypokinesis, an EF 45% as above, a small pericardial effusion, and an abnormally small LV cavity (which is not reported on a repeat ECHO this admission).  The last two findings are new since [**11-25**].  An exercise stress test as well as a persantine stress test earlier this month were both prematurely terminated after the patient dropped his pressures. He had a normal ETT in '[**90**] and an ETT with elevation in his BP with exercise in [**11-25**].
64M PMH mechanical MVR, recent admission for SDH s/p evacuation p/w subtherapeutic INR. The patient was discharged [**2574-3-5**] after a two-week hospitalization for SDH. His INR was noted to be 1.7 the day of admission and he was sent to the ED for heparin gtt. He had taken his prescribed coumadin 15 mg PO today. He believes he has been complaint with his coumadin, but admits to some confusion regarding his medications as he was recently discharged with several new medications. Per notes he complained of somnulence earlier, but currently denies. . In the ED, VS 98.4 112/67 54 20 99%RA. CT head negative for acute change. He was given coumadin 2.5 mg PO after discussion with the patient's PCP and was started on heparin gtt. . On arrival to the floor, the patient has no specific complaints. . ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.
CC: 74-year-old male patient of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 119**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9079**] [**Name (STitle) 9080**] with a history of mitral regurgitation who is scheduled for repair of the valve on [**2913-8-18**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], referred for a right and left heart catheterization followed by surgical repair of his mitral valve. HPI: This is a 74-year-old male with a history of [**Last Name (STitle) 9081**] and hypertension who has been routinely followed by cardiology for mitral regurgitation.  He has regular surveillance echocardiograms and has been generally asymptomatic over the past twenty years since diagnosis. On [**2913-7-25**] he had his routine yearly echocardiogram.  He was found to have an increase in his pulmonary artery pressure to 38 mm Hg. Previous echocardiograms have the PA pressures between 24-27 mmHg.  The report also found mitral valve prolapse with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation.   He had preserved biventricular size and systolic function.  His LVEF was > 55%. In terms of symptoms Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9082**] reports an increase in exertional dyspnea over the past two years ago.  At times he develops chest pressure when he walks up more than one flight of stairs quickly.  He also has occasional dyspnea associated with the chest pressure.  He is able to exercise on his treadmill about 15 minutes each day doing about ?????? a mile.  In addition he reports occasional bilateral ankle edema. Of note this gentleman had a stress echo on [**2911-5-20**].  He was able to exercise 12 minutes 15 seconds on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol to a maximum heart rate of 109 representing 73% of his age predicted maximum heart rate.   He was noted to have 0.5-1mm ST segment depression in the inferolateral leads which resolved with 2 minutes of rest.  He experienced no chest discomfort, shortness of breath or dyspnea.  The echocardiogram showed severe mitral regurgitation but pulmonary artery pressure was normal.  LVEF was > 55%.
62 y.o. male s/p cadaver renal transplant [**2752-9-8**] with repair of left inguinal hernia after failed renal transplant in [**2745-7-19**] [**1-16**] DM/HTN. Recent renal transplant c/b delayed graft function and worsening of CHF. He was discharged to rehab with a foley in place for bladder retention. He was sent to rehab on flomax on [**9-16**]. The foley was to remain in place for 2 weeks. During his stay at rehab, the foley was removed. Creatinine increased to 7.5 with 2-3+ bilateral leg edema, low blood pressure and urine output was low. Patient had no specific complaints.
The patient is an 83-year-old female who had a colonoscopy and polypectomy three days prior to presentation.  The patient went home and had two days of bright red blood per rectum.  She also developed right lower quadrant pain which seemed to be getting worse.  She spiked a fever up to 103 degrees Fahrenheit with worsening of pain and distention, at which point she presented to the Emergency Department.
85yo RHM on coumadin for A-fib, sustained fall on [**2-/3000**] where he hit his head.  He was taken to [**Location (un) **] ED where head CT revealed bilat cystic hygromas. He was scheduled for an MRI which was performed two weeks ago and referred to Neurologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]/?[**Hospital3 68**]) who is scheduled to see him this Friday.  However, Pt fell again ~[**4-6**] and hit the side of his head and has had increasingly hesitant speech and some difficulty ambulating, therefore was referred for an outpatient NCHCT this afternoon.   Pt was called back to the ED once the films were read and subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further eval.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9106**] is an 85 year old male with a history of recent admission [**Date range (1) 9107**] for bilateral SDH s/p burr holes [**4-18**], atrial fibrillation now off Coumadin on Digoxin, hypertension, and diastolic dysfunction who presents from [**Hospital **] Rehab with possible digoxin toxicity leading to ventricular tachycardia and unresponsiveness. . The patient was recently hospitalized from [**Date range (3) 9108**] after a fall complicated by hesitant speech and some difficulty ambulating, and head CT on admission showed acute on chronic bilateral subdural hematomas with mass effect and evidence of early downward transtentorial herniation. He had bilateral burr holes placed by neurosurgery on [**4-18**]. CXR on [**4-19**] showed increasing left basilar opacification, and he was thought to have an aspiration PNA and CHF. He was transferred to medicine and treated with a 10 day course of Cipro and Flagyl. He had diarrhea and leukocytosis, but C. diff negative x3. He was kept NPO and his Na rose to 150 on [**4-22**], and this was treated with D5W. His atrial fibrillation was difficult to control, and required uptitration of his Metoprolol. (Note: As an outpatient, he was on Amiodarone). His home dose of Coumadin 2.5 mg daily was restarted [**4-25**] (7 days post-op). He then developed atrial fibrillation with RVR, hypotension, and hct drop and was transferred to the MICU. Warfarin was discontinued. EP was consulted and recommended Metoprolol and Digoxin. He continued to have cough and was discharged on empiric Vanc/Zosyn for a 14 day course. At the time of discharge, his WBC was 15.1, Hct 26.1, Na 140, Cr 0.9, Dig level 1.3. . The following information was obtained from a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Upon discharge to [**Hospital1 **], his temperature was 102.3 on the evening of admission, and he remained febrile until [**5-23**]. He had continued to have diarrhea, and had a rectal tube in place until 2 days PTA. He developed renal failure over the past 1 week. The physician there was concerned that the Vancomycin IV bid was contributing to his renal failure, so it was changed to Vanco IV daily. When the Vanc/Zosyn were completed, he was started on Vanco and Flagyl PO for presumed C. diff. He had an NG tube placed in order to get free water boluses, which was removed 2 days PTA. Over the past 2 days, the patient has had almost no PO intake and very dry mouth. His Lasix was being held for the renal failure. On the day PTA, his labs showed WBC 17.3, Na 149, Cr 2.8, BNP 519. Because of the continued leukocytosis, he was started on Ceftazidime 2 gm IV daily. His Dig level was found to be 2.2, so his Digoxin was decreased to 125 mcg daily. There was no Digibind in the facility. On the morning of admission, the patient was found to have bradycardia to 32 on telemetry and then went into a "torsades" rhythm. His bp was down to 92/52 (from a baseline of SBP 130-140, and a code was called as the patient was more unresponsive. no meds were given as there was no Magnesium was in the building, and the patient remained arousable to stimuli. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. . In the ED, vitals were temp 98.1, HR 40-90, bp 140/90, RR 20, SaO2 100% on RA. His WBC was up to 15.7 (from 15.1 on discharge [**5-20**]), Hct 35.3 (from 26.1), Na 157 (from 140), Cr 2.7 (from 0.9), Dig 2.8 (from 1.3). TropT 0.08, CK 20, MB not done. The patient was awake and verbal, but moaning. EKG showed slow atrial fibrillation, with bradycardia down to 30-50. CXR Portable showed persistent left retrocardiac opacity likely due to pleural effusion and atelectasis although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. CT Head showed stable appearance of small bilateral subdural fluid collections and small unchanged focus in the right frontal cortex, but no new hemorrhage or infarct. He was given 1 L NS, Potassium 40 mEq per 1 L, and Digibind 50 mL, and Zofran 4 mg IV x1. . Unable to obtain ROS as patient not responding.
This is a 65 year old female with a past medical history notable for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass graft, right lower lobectomy, asthma and congestive heart failure, who presents complaining of cough times one week, malaise and fatigue. The patient had a low grade temperature of 99.6 F., at home. The patient denied any lower extremity edema or weight gain. The patient's peak flows at home were in the 150 range. The patient was recently admitted to the hospital [**1-28**] until [**2-5**] for similar complaints of shortness of breath and cough.  At that time, she was treated with steroids, Azithromycin and nebulizers for a presumed bronchitis exacerbation. In the Emergency Room, the patient was treated with a Combivent nebulizer, Solu-Medrol intravenously, Levaquin and Lasix.
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female admitted [**2774-3-1**], from [**Hospital3 9150**] after a recent discharge from [**Hospital1 341**] for cellulitis admitted with acute respiratory distress complicated by hypotension.  The patient was intubated in the Emergency Department and placed on pressors which was complicated by a ventricular tachycardia arrest likely secondary to Dopamine. The patient had ST depressions on her EKG at the time, ruled out for myocardial infarction, but echocardiogram at that time showed an ejection fraction of 15%.  She was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with issues of Gram negative rods in the sputum with a pneumonia on her chest x-ray, yeast in her urine which was never treated.  Pulmonary shows bilateral pleural effusions, pneumonia, and a mostly unexplained high degree of hypoxia.
This 75 year old female has a history of cardiomyopathy with a 30% EF, and a DDD pacemaker and has been having shortness of breath with exertion for the past three years.  A [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacemaker was attempted on [**2674-4-27**] and was unsuccessful.  She had a CS dissection and further attempts were abandoned.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 902**] was consulted for atrial lead placement via left thorocotomy.
The patient is a 64-year-old lady with locally advanced non-small cell cancer that was initially presented as superior vena cava syndrome more than one year ago and recently diagnosed subsegmental PE who initially presented to the Emergency Department on [**3369-3-28**] with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. She was subsequently found to have a large PE with a tamponade physiology.  She had a pericardial window placed on [**3369-3-30**] without any complications.  She had remained hemodynamically stable since.  Her chronic anticoagulation for a history of superior vena cava syndrome and PE was initially reversed to enable the pericardial placement. Postoperatively, the decision was made to re-initiate anticoagulation given her hypercoagulable state, but the therapeutic INR range was decreased to 1.5 to 2.  She was also started on an intravenous heparin drip with a goal partial thromboplastin time of 60 to 70 while her INR was subtherapeutic. She was called out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the East Oncology/Medicine Service as she was clinically stable. While she was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, she also had a barium swallowing study done to evaluate a questionable small amount of air behind the esophagus on her admission chest computed tomography.  The barium swallowing study was normal.  Her stay int he Medical Intensive Care Unit was also notable for episodes of psychosis which were attributable to opioids side effects.
**As obtained from patient, patient's son and [**Name (NI) **] records** [**Age over 90 **] yo F with past history of aortic stenosis, CAD s/p CABG x3 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to RCA, SVG to OM) and s/p LMCA and PCxA stent, CHF, bronchiectasis, obstructive sleep apnea, HTN, hyperlipidemia, who presents with progressive dyspnea following discharge from this hospital on [**2579-10-2**]. She was on room air upon discharge and saturations were ~92%; however, she reports that she has been on oxygen "day and night" and presented to the ED with 3L nasal cannula for supplemental O2. Patient reports that she has been dyspneic with any movement in the last few days. Only [**Doctor Last Name **] she is perfectly still will she breath comfortably. Patient reports that her sputum production had changed from white sputum early in the week to dark brown sputum later in the week with some episodes of hemoptysis. Her son reports several days of low grade fevers. She reports being very fatigued currently as in such state has a hard time relaying the history in the past week. She feels that her memory has suffered during her recent illness. [**Name (NI) **] son states that during an office visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] yesterday they had discussed valvuloplatsy and percutaneous aortic valves. When I asked the son about patient's weight gain since leaving the [**Last Name (STitle) **], she had only gained 0.4 pounds since discharge on [**2579-10-2**]. In the ED, the patient was afebrile with vitals prior to transfer of T 97.9, BP 121/63, HR 71, RR 18, O2sat 95% 3L NC. Had a chest xray in the ED that was consistent with pulmonary edema; however, underlying pneumonia could not be ruled out. Patient was subsequently given Levofloxacin 750 mg IV. Patient also received 20 mg IV lasix while in the ED, but there is no documentation of a response in urine output to that dose. Was guaiac negative in the ED. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: General: (+)ve: cough, hemoptysis, fevers (-)ve: stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. Cardiac: (+)ve: chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea (sits up to sleep in hospital bed) (-)ve: paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope, presyncope
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 7703**] is a 90F with a PMH s/f critical aortic stenosis s/p recent valvuloplasty in [**9-/2579**] who presented to [**Hospital3 4047**] with right groin pain.  The patient was admitted [**Date range (2) 9271**] for complaints of dyspnea. A cardiac catheterization was performed to determine the etiology.  After evaluation of the coronary arteries showed no culprit lesion that was amenable to PCI, the team proceeded with an aortic balloon valvulotomy, as they felt the dyspnea was likely secondary to her critical AS. At the conclusion of the case it was noted that patient was forming a massive right groin hematoma.  She was transiently hypotensive, and required three units of pRBCs, fluids, dopamine, and neosynephrine.  She was able to be weaned off within 30 minutes. . At [**Hospital3 4047**] the patient was noted to be hypotensive.  She was started on peripheral dopamine, transfused 2 units of blood, and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  In the ED initial vitals were HR 106, BP 88/56, RR 20, O2 Sat 85% 3L. Patient was maintained on neosynephrine and weaned off dopamine with resolution of tachycardia. CT scan was obtained and patient was admitted to CCU. . On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
This patient is a 72 year old male who complains of SOB. PMHX significant for history of renal transplant in [**3074**] presented with sudden onset of shortness of breath at 5 AM this morning after getting out of the shower he describes as a shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion. He denies any fevers chills cough chest pain nausea vomiting diarrhea or increased swelling in his legs.
84 y/o male w/ history of CAD s/p CABG, A fib, TIAs, prostate CA, who was doing well at home until he tripped over a vacuum cleaner cord and fell. He denies LOC and head trauma. He immediately felt pain in his left hip and was unable to bear weight. He was initially taken to Valley Hospital where X-rays revealed a left femoral neck fracture. There were no other noted injuries. He was neurovascularly intact distally. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for operative orthopedic management.
Patient is an 83 year old femal who went out on the porch to get her mail, slipped on steps and fell about 5 feet and struck here head on the rail and ground.  She denies loss of conciousness, lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath, prior to fall. She complains of a headache and a large [**4-2**] centimeter laceration to her parietal/posterior aspect of her scalp.  No other obvious injuries.  Also complains of some back pain in upper thoracic/lower c-spine area.  Patient takes coupmadin for Afib.  She has also had 2 falls in the last 6 months
The patient initially presented with a positive Hemoccult. Following which he underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed a cecal mass with high-grade dysplasia. On [**2598-4-19**] he underwent an extended right colectomy and a right inguinal hernia repair. His postoperative course was complicated by an anastomotic leak. A drain was placed on [**4-30**] and the patient was D/Cd on [**5-4**]. The patient developed fever to 100.4 and was readmitted on [**5-5**] with a RLL pneumonia.  He was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn but continued to have recurrent fevers.  He was evaluated by hematology for a WBC ct. >150K, they stated this was due to a leukomoid reaction on top of his underlying MDS.  On [**5-5**] he developed SOB which CXR revealed to be due to CHF he was diuresed with Lasix.  On [**5-14**] he had a ex lap with small bowel resection, drainage of pelvic abscess, debridement of abdominal wall and ileostomy.  Post-op he was admitted to the SICU for management of his low urine output/ARF.  Repeat imaging has revealed that the abscess has decreased in size.  He was transferred out of the SICU on [**5-19**].  His improving CHF, decreasing WBC, and absence of fevers have enabled the patient to be surgically cleared and his care has been transferred to medicine.
85M transferred from surgery.  Had colon cancer s/p colectomy [**3-27**], complicated by ileal perf leading to ileostomy. Originally planned for ileosotomy revision on [**11-15**], however, presented to ED [**11-10**] w/ abdominal pain, found to have acute cholecystitis.
85 y.o M with an extensive past medical hx including MDS, colon CA s/p resection, recent ileostomy revisions and takedown, cholecystectomy c/b MRSA and klebsiella pna and prolonged hospital course. Pt was hypotensive post-op requiring brief SICU stay when found to have pna and arf [**12-26**] hypotension. Pt then transfered to medicine team and received a course of Meropenem and Vanco (completed1/11). Pt found to have b/l pleural effusions R>L. Thorocentesis was negative for empyema. Pt also afebrile for entire admission except one low grade temp to 100.5. Pt went to rehab on [**2598-12-3**] where he was doing quite well until [**2598-12-18**] when pt awoke in resp distress. HE was transfered to OSH where he was found to have large L sided pleural effusion. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment.
The patient is an 86 year old male with a history of CAD, congestive heart failure, and dementia who presents from [**Hospital3 **] with shortness of breath, hypoxia, and a chest x-ray showing pneumonia. He was reportedly feeling more short of breath all day, with general malaise.  He was given oxygen and nebulizer treatments without improvement and CXR at [**Hospital 7049**] showed bilateral infiltrates concerning for pneumonia.  He was given a dose of Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  He was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] by EMS.  While en route, he was given a bolus of normal saline and Duonebs by EMS. . In the ED, initial vital signs were T 97.0, BP 85/44, HR 107, RR 28, and SpO2 91% on NRB.  He triggered for hypotension and was given additional IV fluids.  Labs showed WBC 6.5 but with 37% bands and 3% metas.  He had creatinine 2.1 with unknown baseline, bicarb 17 with anion gap 17, and lactate 5.5.  His Troponin was 0.05 and his BNP was [**Numeric Identifier 7741**].  CXR in the ED again showed bibasilar infiltrates concerning for pneumonia.  He was given Vancomycin 1000 mg IV and Levofloxacin 750 mg IV.  He was admitted to the ICU for further management.  Prior to transfer, his vitals were BP 119/53 (105/43 sleeping), HR 103, RR 15, and SpO2 97% on NRB. . Once in the ICU, he reported some continued shortness of breath and cough.  On questioning, he noted that he often coughs after eating.  He has been feeling unwell and more fatigued over the last few days. He notes having some intermittent chest pain at baseline, but no pain currently.  He was quickly weaned down to nasal cannula.
87-year-old male transferred from the [**Hospital3 **] for increased malaise and reported hypoxia. Per EMS the patient has been more somnolent today than usual, however also was found to have a low oxygen saturation at evening rounds. Reportedly to be in the mid 80s. Unknown if patient has been feeling unwell prior. Patient has a significant history of cardiac disease, congestive heart failure, [**Hospital3 **] pneumonias. He is also incontinent of urine and wears diapers. Patient has a DNR, DNI paperwork with him. Son [**Doctor First Name 1143**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] who is on his way into the hospital. . In the ED inital vitals were, Temperature 100.8, Pulse: 103, RR: 28, BP: 84/43, O2Sat: 88, O2 Flow: 100 (Non-Rebreather). On exam: he is somnolent, although he does respond to his name; of note he only speaks Russian, coarse bilateral breath sounds, although there are no focal rhonchi, or crackles; urine is extremely purulent appearing, patient does not appear to have any abdominal pain, there is no pedal edema . Labs significant for bandemia (21%) with normal WBC count (8.7), creatinine 1.9, INR 1.3, grossly positive U/A. CXR demonstrated patchy opacity at bilateral lung bases. On discussion with the patient it was decided that he is DNR/DNI, but would agree to Bi-Pap. He did not agree to CVL placement or other invasive intervention. He was placed on Bipap 10/g with 50% FiO2, and oxygen saturation improved to 97%. VS before transfer were 85 BP 99/34 RR 20 SpO2% 99/bipap 10/5 50%. He was switched back to a NRB prior to transfer. ABG demonstrated pH 7.34 pCO2 40, pO2 144, HCO3 23. . Of note during a prior admission, a family meeting was held. There was discussion of plans to address what to do if he develops respiratory distress again, but no final plan documented, except that he is DNR/DNI but would want to be rehospitalized. . On arrival to the ICU, he is unresponsive to verbal stimuli, but responded to sternal rub.
87 yo wheelchair bound male with CAD s/p PCI [**3381**], CVA in [**3377**], HTN, dementia, and recurrent [**Year (4 digits) **] PNA, with recent admission for acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation with EF=30% in [**9-18**] who presented with respiratory distress from [**Hospital3 2520**] nursing home. Nursing home records indicated that the patient was short of breath and found to be highly congested with decreased oxygen sats and crackles. A stat CXR was ordered by the PA. The attending came in today and noted the patient was unresponsive in bed so he was referred to the ED for further managament. He is typically oriented only to self but can report if he is in pain. He was recently admitted for acute on chornic systolic CHF exacerbation and was concomitantly treated for [**Hospital3 **] pneumonia with vanco/zosyn then levofloxacin for a total course of 3 days. Antibiotics were stopped prior discharge. Per EMS patient had a recent pneumonia also has a history of CHF they were called for respiratory distress. EMS reported that the patient was full code. Upon arrival to the ED, he was on positive pressure ventilation with sats in the low 90's. He was unable to speak secondary to respiratory distress and appeared as if he was tiring. Noted to have bibasilar rales. As a result he was easily intubated with a 7.5 ETT with etomidate and succinylcholine. He was sedated with fentanyl and midazolam. He was tachycardic to the 130s and had a blood pressure in the systolics of 60, so norepinephrine was started. Paperwork was then faxed over that noted the patient is DNR/DNI. A left IJ was attempted but the line went laterally. A right IJ placed into the cavoatrial junction. He was given a total of 6L NS. His UA returned positive. He also has a 20G in his right hand. He was given vanco/zosyn. EKG was concerning for a ST elevation in lead 3, in the context of a LBBB. Cardiology was consulted and felt that these changes were likely a result of sepsis with demand ischmia as these changes improved with improved hemodynamics. They recommended serial trops, Echo, and aspirin with heparin if no evidence of DIC. On arrival to the MICU, he is intubated and unresponsive.
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 7769**] is an 87 Russian-speaking woman from the [**Location (un) 3109**] with history of dCHF, Hypertension, Hypothyroidism, Hyperlipidemia, with >1yr history of exudative bilateral pleural effusions, presenting for elective admission for medical thorascopy with talc pleurodesis of left effusion.  Bilateral pleural effusions initially attributed to CHF, did not respond completely to diuresis, found to be exudative and lymphocytic after multiple thoracenteses.  Last [**Month (only) **], patient underwent medical thoracoscopy with talc pleurodesis on right side, which improved right sided effusion temporarily.  Cytology and culture negative at that time, and effusion still exudative.  Patient admitted now for elective mediastinal thorascopy on left in setting of recurrent Left sided pleural effusions and persistent fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. Thoracentesis was attempted [**12/2997**], but procedure was stopped after 500ml were removed in setting of discomfort and question of trapped lung. Patient underwent talc pleurodesis on left on day of admission, requiring ketamine for sedation.  Received nerve block prior to procedure.  Nonspecific inflammation, patchy erythema seen in pleura with no overt evidence of cancer.  Fluid sent for AFB smear and culture, fungal culture, gram stain and culture, cytology.  Pleural biopsy done for pathology as well.  She was given 800 cc LR in the OR and 250cc bolus in PACU.  Pleurex catheter and chest tube in place to suction.  Vitals in PACU post-op as follows: BP 120/80 HR 60-80s RR  SaO2 96% 6L NC.  She took a few hours to recover from sedation and ketamine, but on arrival to the floor, she felt well overall.  She denied any pain in her chest/lungs.  Denied shortness of breath at rest.
81 yo F with CAD s/p past PCI, CKD, hypertension, recent diagnosis of heart failure, was discharged from the hospital on [**2925-3-16**] after a presentation for chest pain. She reports that she had 7 good days following discharge and then started feeling poorly on Thursday [**2925-3-22**]. Symptoms began with unsteadiness and tremulouness. She reports some mild confusion in last week. Patient also began to notice worsening LE edema as well as weight gain from 148 pounds at discharge on [**2925-3-16**] to 153 pounds on morning of presentation here. In the two days prior to admission, the patient developed a right-sided CP, non-radiating, which she reports was similar to the CP she had at last presentation. Of note, patient reports a week of constipation prior to having formed bowel movement two days prior to presentation as well as loose stool on morning prior to admission. She notes abdominal distension, some abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and early satiety. She has had poor PO intake in the last two weeks, but reports that she has been strictly adhering to a low sodium diet and has been drinking lots of water daily. In the ED, initial vital signs were T 97.5, HR 62, BP 168/60, RR 18, 95% RA. For her CP received nitro SL and morphine and became chest pain free. First set of cardiac enzymes was negative. CXR was taken with note of small bilateral pleural effusion, not significantly changed from CXR at prior admission on [**2925-3-14**]. Was identified as having hyponatremia with serum sodium of 112. For her hyponatremia, received a 250 mL NS bolus. Upon transfer to the floor, the patient was comfortable and chest pain free. Denied confusion, though reported some increased tremulousness. ROS: (+)ve: chest pain, lower extremity edema, weight gain, dyspnea on exertion, tremulousness, unsteady gait, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, constipation, loss of appetite, early satiety (-)ve: orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, cough fever, sweats, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, hematuria, hematochezia, melena, visual changes
This is an 80-year-old Russian- speaking male with a history of coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft), type 2 diabetes, and chronic renal failure who presents with two days of extreme shortness of breath at rest and dull 7/10 chest pain with radiation to the left shoulder.  Positive paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, two-pillow orthopnea, and positive peripheral edema.  The patient has not had any change in his medications or diet.  The patient saw his primary care physician this morning and was noted to be hypoxic and was sent to the Emergency Department. In the Emergency Department, found to have evidence of congestive heart failure and acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3.2 (baseline of 2) and ST depressions in V2 to V4 on electrocardiogram.  The patient was given aspirin and started on a heparin drip.  He was given Plavix, nitroglycerin, and morphine and is now pain free.  The patient was also given one dose of Lasix with minimal response.

This is a 83 Y/o M with h/o CAD s/p CABG [**2746**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to D1, SVG to PDA) recently admitted in [**Month (only) 946**] for NSTEMI and underwent POBA of LMCA and LCx, presented again from home with recurrent chest discomfort. He recently saw his cardiologist where he reported occasional exertional and rest chest discomfort but was felt to be poor candidate for revascularization. Patient was found by home health aide to have increasing shortness of breath and worsening chest discomfort at rest. Patient apparently had shortness of breath since previous night, but noted acute worsening this AM. He denies any increased salt intake or non-adherence to diuretic regimen. Home health felt he looked unwell, and called EMS. Patient says the pain resembeled his typical anginal symptoms, substernal radiating to left arm and is similar but less intense than pain experienced during previous hospitalzation. . ECG done by EMS showed ST-depressions and TWI in V2-V5, similar to ECG changes on previous admission. He was also hypoxic with saturation fo 85%. He was given 3 sublingual nitroglycerin's by EMS with incomplete resolution of symptoms. Patient was started on heparin gtt, nitroglycerin gtt and given 40mg IV furosemide in the ED. He was then evaluated by cardiology and taken for catheterization. . In the Cath lab, patient was found to have the following: LMCA with 80% diffuse disease (known to have severe diffuse disease with moderate calcification on previous catheterization) LAD occluded with patent LIMA->LAD and good distal flow LCx with 90% proximal lesion RCA not injected . Unable to cross LCx lesion with balloon, therefore, rotawire of LMCA and LCx was attempted, with resultant LCx dissection. Final angiography demonstrated subtotal occlusion of LCx with extensive midvessel dissection with localized contained intromyocardial perforation. Patient was then admitted to CCU for monitoring due to concerns for hemopericardium and tamponade.
84M Russian-speaking with h/o severe 3-vessel CAD unamenable to PCI s/p CABG x4 ([**2746**]) and MI x3, chronic angina, DM, CHF (EF 30-35%) presented from clinic with progressive dyspnea x 2 days. The patient developed SOB and worsening orthopnea at home. He was also having chest pain which is similar to his chronic angina. He denies fevers, chills, cough, or sick contacts and reports that he was taking his medications at home. At clinic, he was noted to have increased peripheral edema (increased over 1 wk per the patient) and was sent to the ED where his vitals were T 97.1 HR 76 BP 148/80 RR 25 SpO2 92%/RA. Bilateral crackles and elevated JVD were noted on examination. CXR revealed bilateral layering effusions and pulmonary edema. ECG was unchanged and cardiac enzymes were CK 137, MB 9, TnT 0.02. He received [**Year (4 digits) **], sl NTG x2, morphine 2mg IV, and lasix 40mg IV. He was admitted for diuresis and r/o MI. . Of note, he has had similar admissions in the past for anginal exacerbations and heart failure, including a recent NSTEMI in [**2-/2761**] (CK up to 1376) that required management in the CCU with an intraaortic balloon pump. He underwent cardiac cath at that admission that resulted in angioplasty of a significant 80% left main lesion, that subsequently restenosed. He subsequently underwent cardiac cath on [**2761-3-30**] that was unsuccessful at circumflex revascularization, resulting in dissection of that artery and contained perforation. Per recent cardiology note, there are no further options for revascularization and his medications are being optimized prior to surgery as he was also recently found to have an adenocarcinoma in his cecum with plans for future resection. He was admitted to the General Surgery service for excision of the colon mass

She was initially admitted to a community hospital in [**State 107**] in [**2683**] for CHF. She improved and was transferred to [**Hospital1 7837**] (at family's request) for further rehabilitation care. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 **], she was intubated for respiratory distress. After 3 weeks of ventilation, she was admitted to [**Hospital 2546**] Medical Center for tracheostomy/PEG placement. She did well post-operatively, and was transferred back to [**Hospital1 **] for Vent weaning. Her initial tracheostomy was changed to a Bavona on [**3-17**]. She did well until one week PTA, when she was noted to have increased work of breathing and dyspnea. The MDs at [**Hospital3 **] decided to change her tracheostomy tube for a longer one. This was done at [**Hospital3 5297**] 4 days PTA. Postoperatively, she had significant respiratory distress, did not tolerate the vent, and was noted to have lower tidal volumes, hypoxia with saturations to the low 90s, cyanosis and a significant cuff leak. She was started on Ceftazidime at her facility for ? PNA.She was thus transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation/intervention. En route, she was very anxious and given 2mg IV ativan. In the ER, she was noted initially to have slight perioral cyanosis with RR 46. Her initial ABG was 7.39/59/70. She then had an episode of significantly decreased tidal volumes. A flexible bronch was done by Dr. [**Name (NI) **] in the ED, which showed a posterior tracheal ulceration at the distal end of the [**Last Name (un) **], with > 98% occlusion of the distal ostia of the tube by the ulcer wall as well as granulation tissue. The bronchoscope was passed through the obstruction, and the patient's O2 saturations, tidal volumes improved. She had two similar episodes in the ED, which improved with upright positioning, cough, and vocalizations. She had a persistent cuff leak. In th ED, she also recieved Vanco 1g IV, Ceftazidime 2gm, Solumedrol 40mg IV and ativan 2mg IV.

Of note, she was recently admitted from [**2662-10-21**] - [**2662-11-1**] for a CHF exacerbation possibly worsened by AF with RVR. During that hospitalization she received aggressive diuresis with Lasix. Fo her atrial fibrillation she was initially transitioned from Metoprolol to Carvedilol but was changed back to Metoprolol for low blood pressures. She also underwent TEE with cardiovesion on [**10-28**] but subsequently developed torsades following a dose of Dofetilide in the settinf of a long QTc and later ventricular fibrillation, for which she received defibrillation x one. Following her arrest, Amiodarone drip was initiated with transition to oral. A BiV ICD was placed successfully on [**10-30**] with lead revision on [**10-31**]. She was discharged the following day. . She had an office visit in device clinic on [**2662-11-6**], during which she reported ongoing fatigue but improving DOE and no palpitations. At that time she was still on Coumadin, which was started during her recent hospitalization. At an appointment on [**2662-11-14**], the patient was scheduled to undergo cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. A TEE was recommended in the setting of subtherapeutic INRs but the patient declined. She was subsequently started on Dabigatran 150 mg [**Hospital1 **], but this was subsequently stopped about three weeks ago [**3-5**] GI upset; the patient also noted that her shortness of breath worsened on it. She was then restarted on coumadin. . She also had an office visit on [**2662-12-1**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7870**] for follow-up after her recent discharge.

On CCU arrival, Vs 108/69 HR 97  patient complaining of sub-sternal chest pain, [**9-8**]. Patient stated that it was similar to the pain he had when he came in. No new EKG changes compare to EKG post cath, ST elevation in precordial leads improving. the chest pain did not respond to 2 sublingual nitro, so Nitro drip was started and Morphine 2mg x2 was given obtaining pain relief. The pt was eventually transferred to the Medical [**Hospital1 **] in a stable condition.
The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with renal cell carcinoma originally diagnosed in [**3266**].  The patient had bilateral partial nephrectomies at that time for chromophobe oocytic component tumor (grade II to III) with 4.5 cm skin size with capillary penetration but negative margins. Cancer was quiescent until two months ago when metastases were noted in the patient's lungs.  The patient presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion over the past two weeks and an oxygen saturation in the 80s on the day of admission at his oncologist's office.  Prior oxygen saturation in [**Month (only) **] had been 99%.  As noted, a chest x-ray in [**3274-4-12**] showed hilar lymphadenopathy and a bronchoscopy with biopsy showed metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The patient denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, and palpitations.  The patient has had a chronic cough for months which has been intermittently productive of yellow and green sputum.  The patient has complained of anorexia over the past several weeks.  The patient notes orthopnea requiring him to sleep on two pillows, but no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The patient went to his oncologist on [**6-25**] for an appointment and had low oxygen saturations to 83% and was sent to the Emergency Department. In the Emergency Department, the patient responded to 3 liters of oxygen with oxygen saturations coming up to 92% but had an increasing oxygen requirement.  The patient was seen by the Primary Medicine team at 4 a.m. and was short of breath on 100% nonrebreather but was mentating well.  An arterial blood gas at that time revealed pH was 7.56, PCO2 was 38, and PO2 was 38. The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation.  The chest x-ray on admission was consistent with congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural effusions.  The patient's last dialysis had been on [**3274-6-23**].
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7944**] is a 77-year-old male with a medical history significant for coronary disease status post myocardial infarction in [**3240**], multiple transient ischemic attacks, hypertension, gastrointestinal bleed, type 2 diabetes mellitus, renal cell carcinoma with metastases to the lungs, status post partial left nephrectomy and end stage renal disease on hemodialysis who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion for the past four weeks. On the day of presentation, [**3274-6-25**], the patient was at his Oncology Clinic appointment where he was found to be dyspneic with just short walking and found to have an oxygen saturation of 83% on room air.  Of note, just one month prior in clinic, the patient had an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air.  He denied history of orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and reported no chest pain at the time. Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7944**] was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital6 1739**] Emergency Department, where his breathing became more labored requiring 100% nonrebreather, which resulted in an oxygen saturation in the low 90s.  His initial vitals were as follows:  Temperature of 98.1.  Heart rate of 76.  Blood pressure 160/80. Respiratory rate of 14.  His oxygen saturation was in the low 90s with 100% nonrebreather. He had diffuse rhonchi and crackles on his lung exam and evidence of volume overload on physical examination.  His chest x-ray demonstrated findings consistent with congestive heart failure, bilateral pleural effusion, bibasilar collapse, consolidation, and mediastinal hilar lymphadenopathy with diffuse bilateral small nodules, consistent with metastatic disease. A repeat chest x-ray revealed worsening pulmonary edema consistent with congestive heart failure.  Patient's blood pressure also rose to 230/120 requiring intravenous nitroglycerin drip.  Once the patient was stabilized, he was transferred to the floor for further care and management.
This is a 78-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension who presented to [**Hospital1 186**] on [**2771-8-17**].  The patient had severe upper back pain and dyspnea on exertion.  She was in her normal state of health until seven days prior to admission when she began experiencing fevers, chills, poor sleep, malaise, cough and shortness of breath.  She had been switched from Zestril to generic lisinopril and there was some question of whether or not she was taking her medications.  She called her primary care physician who suspected [**Name Initial (PRE) **] viral illness.  About a day prior to admission she noticed acute back pain, dyspnea on exertion, cough and increasing pedal edema.  The patient described her back pain as sudden in onset without radiation. There was no syncope, chest pain, shortness of breath or pleurisy.  She also denied palpitations, fevers, chills, headache and visual changes, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The patient was initially admitted to the medical intensive care unit where she was started on a Nipride drip and noted to have blood in her urine.  The patient was treated aggressively with Lasix for congestive heart failure and diuresed a couple of liters.  The patient had a bump in her creatinine to 1.4 and diuresis was discontinued.  The patient was also treated with an esmolol drip and then lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, Lasix and Lopressor.  Her blood pressure prior to transfer to the floor was 147/76.  She had hyponatremia that had slowly corrected with fluid restriction and her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was stable with albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.3, blood pressure 134/70, heart rate 72, respiratory rate 20, saturating 95-97% on room air.  Generally she was in no acute distress, alert and oriented x 3 but sleepy.  Her skin showed no rashes.  Her nails were normal.  Her hair was thin.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination showed the pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  Mucous membranes were dry. The patient had no neck stiffness, no lymphadenopathy and jugular venous pressure to 6 cm.  Back showed no spinal or paraspinal tenderness, no kyphosis or scoliosis.  Pulmonary examination showed decreased breath sounds at the bases with crackles at both bases one-third of the way up, no wheezes or rubs.  Heart had a regular rate, normal S1, normal S2, S4 was present, high-pitched [**1-11**] diastolic murmur at the lower left sternal border.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with bowel sounds present.  There were no masses or hepatosplenomegaly, no clubbing, no cyanosis, no edema. Her extremities were cool with 2+ pedal pulses. LABORATORY DATA:  On admission her white count was 6.0, hemoglobin 12.3, hematocrit 36.1, platelet count 252, sodium 133, potassium 3.7, chloride 93, bicarbonate 30, BUN 22, creatinine 1.4, glucose 93. The patient had a chest CT that showed diffusely calcified and tortuous aorta but no evidence of aortic dissection or aneurysmal dilatation.  Findings were suggestive of congestive heart failure with a moderate-sized pleural effusion on the right and a small left pleural effusion. Reticular nodular opacities were seen with the bilateral mid and lower lung zones likely representing engorged lymphatics. There were degenerative changes of the lumbosacral spine. EKG was sinus rhythm with rate of 75, PR of 175 with multiple abnormalities including T waves that were diffusely inverted raising a question of evolving ischemia. Echocardiogram revealed left atrial elongation, moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of approximately 30%.  Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were normal.  The aortic valves were mildly thickened but not stenotic.  There was 2+ aortic regurgitation seen.  The mitral valve leaflets were markedly thickened.  There was no mitral prolapse.  There was mild to moderate mitral regurgitation seen. HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Congestive heart failure flare:  The patient continued to be stable on room air.  Her Lasix diuresis was discontinued due to increase in creatinine. However, her hydrochlorothiazide was continued and Lasix was held. 2. Hypertension:  The patient was held to a goal pressure of 140/90 or less.  Metoprolol was increased to 25 mg b.i.d. and a calcium channel blocker was considered but not needed to keep the pressure under 140/70. 3. Coronary artery disease:  The patient was thought to be at risk for future coronary artery disease and was scheduled for

She states that she had been feeling weak for several weeks prior to her admission there at [**Hospital3 6512**], with several adjustments to her medications by her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was initially stopped on hydrochlorthiazide about a month prior to hospitalization due to rash, and then started on bumex. This was later increased to 1mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**10-30**]. It was stopped on [**11-19**] due to thinking that this was contributing to her weakness, but she felt no better with discontinuation and was admitted to [**Hospital1 **]. . During this time, she also felt progressively worsening shortness of breath that was exacerbated by movement. She also experienced increasing orthopnea as well as increased swelling of her hands and feet over the same period. She had been started on the bumex due to some of this swelling occuring prior to her feeling weak, but this has worsened markedly. .

EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: 75 year old male with a history of IDDM, HTN and CKD with recent admission for LLE cellulitis treated with Augmentin (he has 4 days left on this course) who was seen in clinic for malaise and admitted based on his laboratory results (Na of 129, anemia with HCT of 29.4 and acute renal failure with Cr of 3.2 from baseline of 2.0). . In the ED, vitals were: T:97.8, HR:102, BP:129/109, RR:20, O2Sat:95% on RA. He was found to have a UTI and was given Unasyn. He was given 2L normal saline for his sodium of 126 and admitted to night float. . The patient reports he was in his usual state of health which includes walking daily until Friday when he awoke from his nap and experienced shaking chills and whole chest, back and shoulder pain "in the muscles". He states that this improved after he was wrapped in several blankets. Then Saturday at 2 am, he awoke to check his blood glucose and noted whole chest, arm and back pain. He was unable to clarify this pain further other than to say it was unbearable. He states it was worse with movement, lying flat, and deep inspiration. He took tylenol and it resolved. He reports generalized fatigue, and decreased appetite. He developed nausea on monday prior to admission, and the day before admission felt unwell and saw his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] clinic he was felt to have a viral syndrome and was sent home with precautions. He recalled and admitted for lab abnormalities as above. . On morning assessment the patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate up to 150, hypotensive down to systolic 70s, temp 99.9, and respiratory distress 93% on 4LNC. The patient also endorsed pleuritic chest pain, similar to the pain he had no the saturday prior to admission. Due to his clinical deterioration, the patient was transferred to the MICU for further care. While in the MICU the patient had a TTE that showed a large pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade (LVEF 55%).  He was taken for an urgent pericardiocentesis. He continued on a course of antibiotics for a UTI. . In the cardiac cath lab he had 600 cc of clear pericardial fluid drained. On arrival to the CCU his chest pain was resolving and his breathing was improved. . ROS: The patient denies any dyspnea, fevers, diarrhea, constipation ( BM [**8-15**] ), vomiting, dysuria.

The patient is a 54 year old white male with a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus, hypertension and atrial fibrillation who presented to the Emergency Department complaining of dyspnea and weakness.  He had recently been hospitalized from [**12-31**] through [**1-7**] for bleeding complication secondary to a liver biopsy.  Additionally from [**12-12**] to [**12-15**] he had been admitted for dyspnea and recurrent deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolus.  The patient's first admission this year with multiple pulmonary embolus were diagnosed by computed tomographic angiography in both lungs in upper and lower lobes.  He presented with dyspnea.  Hypercoagulable workup was done.  Anticoagulation with heparin drip and Warfarin was started.  His dyspnea improved and he was discontinued to home.  An incident finding on computerized tomography scan noted a hepatic nodule which was found during the hospitalization and further imaging was worrisome lesion of the liver and biopsy was arranged.  Anticoagulation was held for a biopsy on [**2859-12-30**].  The patient suffered a hematocrit drop from 38 to 28 and hepatic subscapular hematoma presented on [**12-14**] with right-sided scapular shoulder pain.  On [**2860-1-2**], the patient went to IR where right hepatic artery branch was noted to be bleeding and embolized subsequently.  Inferior vena cava placement filter was not done at that time and her anticoagulation was restarted on [**1-4**] and the patient was subsequently discontinued to home on [**2860-1-7**] with Lovenox and Coumadin.  According to the patient's wife he began to feel fatigued within one to two days after discontinuing.  On [**2860-1-10**], the patient's dyspnea began to worsen and he was not able to begin to climb one flight of stairs.  On the morning of admission the patient could not walk six feet without dyspnea and had severe fatigue.  The patient did not complain of chest pain or palpitations, fevers, chills, headache, twitching or paresthesias. On arrival to the Emergency Department the patient was obtunded and diaphoretic with oxygen saturations of 90% via nasal cannula on Dopamine drip.  The patient was started on Dopamine drip with systolic blood pressure in the 70s.  The patient then became bradycardiac with a heartrate in the 40s with thready peripheral pulses increased hypoxia and nonresponsive.  The patient was difficult to bag and was intubated on the second attempt.  Pulse was always present with systolic blood pressure in the 70s.  Oxygen saturations were very difficult to monitor in the 80s, poor plethora. Atropine 1 mg intravenously times one, epinephrine 1 mg intravenously times one were both given.  Heartrate increased to 120 and systolic blood pressure 80s by doppler. Electrocardiogram changes without acute ST elevations, sinus tachycardia with poor R wave progression.  Left side, very depressed left ventricular function and no blood in the peritoneum.  PLC placed in the right femoral vein urgently. Dopamine drip was started at 30 mcg/kg on transfer to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory.  In the Catheterization Laboratory, right heart catheterization revealed a pulmonary artery pressure of 49/17, right ventricular 49/15, wedge of approximately 28 and minimal flow to the left lower lobe with some filling in the left upper lobe.  Coronary angiography revealed no significant disease.  Left dominant, mild left main, 50% left anterior descending and minimal luminal irregularities.  Because of the previous history of pulmonary embolisms in the past, surgical embolectomy was not a favorable option.  Percutaneous embolectomy was also technically not feasible.  Thrombolytic treatment was ultimately started at 1325 PM, 100 mg intravenously to be dosed over two hours.  The patient was subsequently brought to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit with right femoral PLC and right femoral RV sheaths in place.
This is a 54-year-old gentleman with a history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in [**2851**], history of hypertension, and atrial fibrillation who presented to the Emergency Department with extreme dyspnea on exertion and weakness. He had been recently hospitalized on [**12-31**] to [**1-7**] for bleeding complications secondary to his liver biopsy.  As well, he was hospitalized on [**12-12**] to [**12-15**] for dyspnea and recurrent deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism. The first admission in [**2859-12-2**] was notable for a diagnosis of multiple pulmonary emboli diagnosed by computed tomography angiogram.  An hypercoagulable workup was done, and anticoagulation with a heparin drip and warfarin were started. His dyspnea improved, and he was discharged to home. An incidental finding on computed tomography scan was found (i.e., a hepatic nodule) during this hospitalization, and further imaging was worrisome for a malignant lesion, and a biopsy was arranged.  His anticoagulation was held for his biopsy on [**12-30**].  He suffered a hematocrit drop from 38 to 28, and a hepatic subcapsular hematoma after this biopsy and presented again to the hospital on [**12-31**] with right scapular and shoulder pain. On [**1-2**], he underwent an hepatic artery branch embolization.  An inferior vena cava was not placed at that time.  His anticoagulation was restarted on [**2860-1-4**], and he was subsequently discharged to home on [**1-7**] with enoxaparin and warfarin. According to the patient's wife, at the time of the current admission, Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] began to feel very fatigued within one to two days after his discharge.  Three to four prior to admission, his dyspnea worsened with not being able to climb one flight of steps on the morning of admission.  He could not even walk six feet without feeling extremely short of breath and fatigued. He denied any chest pain, palpitations, fevers, chills, headache, twitching, or paresthesias. In the Emergency Department, the patient was obtunded and diaphoretic with an oxygen saturation of 90% and had a systolic blood pressure in the 70s (requiring pressor initiation).  He then became bradycardic with his heart rate in the 40s and thready peripheral pulses with increased hypoxia.  He became nonresponsive.  He was intubated on the second attempt.  He never lost a pulse.  His systolic blood pressures remained in the 70s.  His oxygen saturation was very difficult to follow.  Atropine and epinephrine were administered with improvement in his heart rate and his systolic blood pressure to the 80s by Doppler. A bedside echocardiogram showed very depressed left ventricular function with no blood in the pericardium.  A triple lumen catheter in the right femoral vein was placed urgently, and a dopamine drip was continued, and the patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed temperature was 95, heart rate was 116 and irregular (on pressors as mentioned), blood pressure was 100/50, and oxygen saturation was in the 80s on synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation of 700 X 16 with 100 FIO2.  His weight was 116 kilograms.  In general, he was intubated and sedated with occasional twitching in the left lower extremity.  His sclerae were anicteric.  There were no conjunctival hemorrhages.  No jugular venous distention was appreciated in this obese gentleman with a thick neck.  The lung sounds were coarse bilaterally without wheezing or crackles.  Heart examination revealed tachycardic.  The abdomen was obese with decreased bowel sounds.  There were no ecchymoses over his abdomen or groin.  Extremities were cool and clammy.  There were no petechia or ecchymoses noted.  Neurologic examination was limited secondary to sedation.  His toes were upgoing bilaterally, on sedation. PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on admission were notable for a white blood cell count of 8,000, hematocrit was 35.7, and platelets were 185.  His INR was 1.6 and partial thromboplastin time was 25, and prothrombin time was 15.3.  Creatinine was 1.5.  Troponin was less than 0.3. Liver function tests were normal.  There was no prothrombin mutation noted on previous testing.  Homocystine was 13.7. Arterial blood gas in the Emergency Department was 7.24/49/62 while intubated on the FIO2 of 100%.  His lactate was 3.9. Anticardiolipin immunoglobulin M was 27 and immunoglobulin G
The patient is a 34-year-old woman gravida 2, para 0 who was admitted on [**3421-2-8**] at 31 weeks 5 days gestation with preterm labor with the above-mentioned history. The patient has been followed for prenatal care by me.  Her prenatal issues were as follows. Positive HIV status with last CD4 count in [**3420-11-17**] of 559--the viral lode on [**3420-12-4**] was 83.  The patient has been diagnosed with positive HIV status for over five years.  During this time, the patient refused to be on antiretroviral therapy.  During this pregnancy, however, she was counseled extensively regarding the decreased incidence of HIV transmission to the fetus with antiretroviral therapy and low viral lode.  The patient agreed to be placed on Combivir one tablet p.o. b.i.d. as well as Viramune 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.  The patient had been compliant with her medication. Hepatitis C--the patient was diagnosed approximately two years ago.  Her liver function tests during this pregnancy had been stable. Multiple history of endocarditis--the patient has been hospitalized numerous times and her most recent episode was approximately two years ago.  At that time, the patient was found to have severe mitral valve regurgitation.  Her most recent echocardiogram which was performed during this pregnancy demonstrated minimal right ventricular systolic function.  Her left ventricular function was intact. History of substance abuse--the patient is currently on a methadone treatment program requiring 95 mg b.i.d. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Left knee surgery, right arm surgery for drainage of abscess. MEDICATIONS:  Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d., Combivir one tablet p.o. b.i.d., Viramune 200 mg p.o. b.i.d., Xanax 0.5 mg p.o. q.h.s., methadone 95 mg p.o. b.i.d., Bactrim DS one tablet q.d., folic acid 2 mg p.o. b.i.d., prenatal vitamins at one tablet p.o. b.i.d., ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. b.i.d. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was in no acute distress.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  General examination was within normal limits. Cardiovascular examination demonstrated [**3-23**] holosystolic murmur with possible S4 gallop.  Abdominal examination demonstrated soft, nontender abdomen with gravid uterus. Extremities revealed trace pedal edema.  Vaginal examination demonstrated 1.5 cm dilatation with 70% effacement.  Fetal heart rate was in the 130s with variability. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for observation with initial administration of magnesium sulfate for preterm labor.  The patient was also given betamethasone earlier during this pregnancy.  The patient was monitored on the antenatal floor and was subsequently weaned off magnesium sulfate.  The patient remained stable with intermittent contractions but without cervical change.  The fetal status was closely monitored during her admission and remained stable.  During the hospitalization, however, the patient continued to have irregular intermittent contractions throughout and the fetus continued to remain in breech presentation. On [**3421-2-22**], the patient underwent primary Cesarean section for continued uterine contractions at 33 weeks and 4 days of gestation.  The Cesarean section was performed under spinal anesthesia without complication. The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for 24 hours of observation.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 65 year old male with a PMH significant for stage 5 CKD of unknown etiology complicated by secondary hyperparathyroidism and anemia who initiated dialysis on [**3083-9-12**]. He also has a history of tobacco use resulting in COPD now with a pulmonary nodule, HTN, CAD, HLD, hyperkalemia, gout, CVA, and carotid endarterectomy.  Per daughter, patient knocked on her door at 3am, saying he couldn't catch breath, she gave him an albuterol neb which initially helped but then he stated he couldn't breath  so they called EMS.  When EMS arrived, his RR was 33 and SBP 170, felt he was in distress and intubated in the field.  Daughter reports no new fever or cough, no increasing albuterol use (though states he has been taking a 'pill' instead of using his neb machine for the last 4 weeks), no missed dialysis, but patient with some increasing edema, particularly L>R leg. . In the ED, initial vs were: T:unknown P:70 BP: 170/60 R O2 sat 100% on ventilator.  On exam, lungs sounded wheezing, 1+ edema. CXR showed RML pneumonia. Potassium high at 5.7.

66 year old [**Location 7877**] man with systolic CHF, ESRD on dialysis, COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peptic ulcer disease, h/p CVA who presented with respiratory distress. The patient was due for HD on Tuesday, the day of admission, but became increasingly short of breath throughout the evening, especially in the last two hours prior to calling EMS. When EMS arrived, the patient was wheezing, diaphoretic, using accesory muscles. Of note, the patient endorsed eating Chinese food the evening prior but did go to hemodialysis and had been compliant with all his medications. The patient was recently hospitalized on the Medicine Service ([**3084-8-29**]) for dyspnea thought to be due to fluid overload. On that admission he had increased his PO fluid intake in the setting of the heat and lost his advair inhaler. A proBNP was [**Numeric Identifier 8090**] in the ED on last admission. . In the ED, initial vital signs were: T 98.3 P 115 BP 215/102 R 22 O2 sat 100% on ?. His history was very limited by respiratory distress and on physical exam, lungs very tight with diffuse wheezing. The patient received duonebs, steroids. He failed trial of bipap and received rocuronium and was intubated, sedated with propofol. His labs were notable for lactate 2.1, leukocytosis to 19.4 with no bands, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 8170**]. Troponin 0.07 in the setting of Cr 9.7. Urinalysis negative. UTox negative. CXR showed congestion suggestive of CHF exacerbation but could not rule out opacities. The patient was felt to have been in respiratory failure secondary to fluid overload with a component of COPD flare, requiring urgent dialysis. He acutely developed wide complex tachycardia, was found to have a blown right pupil (unclear baseline exam) and EKG concerning for STEMI. The patient [**Numeric Identifier 1811**] CT head for the blown right pupil which showed no intracranial hemorrhage. . Cardiology was consulted and Code STEMI was called. The patient was admitted to the CCU from the Cath Lab. ECHO showed EF 30-35%. In the CCU, Neurology was consulted who reviewed the CT head and felt he had not had an acute stroke. His dilated right pupil resolved and was felt due to albuterol exposure of the right eye. Right femoral line was placed when it was noticed that the patient had blueness and mottling of his foot; [**Numeric Identifier **] Surgery was called who recommended STAT removal of sheath and heparinization, with which the leg turned pink. Heparin gtt was continued for LV thrombus concerns. He was dialyzed with 400cc fluid removal, with vast improvement in pulmonary status (negative 1.4L length of stay) and the patient was extubated. He started complaining of abdominal pain (RUQ) the morning of [**9-2**] and given maalox/simethicone. . The patient was called out to [**Hospital Ward Name 120**] 2 where he continued to have abdominal pain which improved with bowel movements, LFTs normal. This morning, [**9-4**], the patient developed severe abdominal pain with radiation to the back. MICU was called to evaluate the patient. There was concern for peritoneal signs and he [**Month (only) 1811**] CTA which showed pancreatitis. Lipase also 208. In this setting, he was transferred to MICU for pain control and volume resuscitation with need for close monitoring as he is anuric at baseline with EF 30-35% and could require intubation/CVVH for pancreatitis management.
This is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of presentation of epigastric pain times four hours. The patient related a history of waking up from sleep by sharp, nonradiating, constant epigastric pain.  The patient stated that over the past week prior to admission, he had some recurrent episodes of hiccups and difficulty swallowing liquids and solids. The patient denied any vomiting, abdominal pain, chills, or chest pain.  The patient denied any fevers.  Normal bowel movement the evening prior to admission with no blood or melena. The patient stated that he has a history of metastatic endocrine tumor of pancreas which has been asymptomatic, and he has lost about ten pounds over the last six months and developed bilateral lower extremity edema over the past week prior to presentation. The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease status post surgery in [**2643**] at the [**Hospital1 1998**]; procedure type was unclear, but may be a [**Name (NI) 8175**].
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, reported myocardial infarction, transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] from [**Hospital6 4239**] after being intubated there for respiratory distress.  The patient had been admitted to [**Hospital6 8179**] four weeks ago and had reportedly ruled in for myocardial infarction there and refused further intervention. After discharge, the patient had tried treatment with sublingual Nitroglycerin but had recurrent and more frequent anginal episodes.  The patient also had been discharged on Bumex but had skipped doses.  In the past day prior to admission, the patient had increasing symptoms of congestive heart failure including paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea as well as increasing angina not relieved by sublingual Nitroglycerin.  The patient was taken to [**Hospital6 8179**].  Initial blood pressure there was 200/79.  The patient received 4 mg of Morphine, 100 mg intravenous Lasix, intravenous Nitroglycerin, Bumex 2 mg with no improvement. Chest x-ray done there showed congestive heart failure. Electrocardiogram done there showed left bundle branch block, heart rate in the 120s.  The patient was intubated with subsequent drop in her blood pressure to 104/44.  The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for CCU evaluation.
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with coronary artery disease (status post ST-elevation myocardial infarction), congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of less than 20%), 4+ aortic regurgitation, and a moderate large pericardial effusion who presented with respiratory failure. The patient was in her usual state of health until one day prior to admission when she began experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath.  The patient took 10 sublingual nitroglycerin tablets for chest pain.  She went to [**Hospital6 4239**] where was intubated and started on intravenous nitroglycerin, heparin, and given Lasix and levofloxacin. A chest computed tomography was done to rule out dissection and was negative.  The patient became hypotensive with nitroglycerin, so she was switched to nitroglycerin paste. her first set of cardiac enzymes was negative.  An electrocardiogram revealed a left bundle-branch block (which was old).  An arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.33, a PCO2 of 41, and a PO2 of 185 on an FIO2 of 1.  A computed tomography scan showed bilateral pleural effusions with a pericardial effusion and a thoracic aortic aneurysm.  The chest x-ray showed left lower lobe and left lingular collapse. The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 186**] for a bronchoscopy.  On arrival, the patient's vital signs were stable.  A bronchoscopy was performed which showed moderate secretions in the posterior right lower lobe and a left upper and left lower lobe obstruction by a mucous plug. The mucous plug was aspirated, and a repeat chest film showed re-inflation of the lung.  A bronchoalveolar lavage specimen showed 2+ polymorphonuclear lymphocytes and no organisms. The patient was initially hypertensive on admission.  She was given fluids and Lopressor.  She then experienced transient hypotension which led to an emergent echocardiogram which showed 4-chamber enlargement, severely depressed left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 20%, a large pleural effusion, and a moderate pericardial effusion without echocardiogram evidence of tamponade.  There was also severe aortic insufficiency, mild mitral regurgitation, and mild tricuspid regurgitation, with a dilated aortic root. The patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes with a peak troponin of 0.83, and a heparin drip was started. The patient then developed hematuria, and as the troponin leak was thought to be due to demand ischemia the heparin was dropped.  The patient's respiratory status improved, and the patient was extubated and transferred to the floor. The patient had been hypertensive and was treated with hydralazine.  Initially, the patient's ACE inhibitor was held for acute renal failure.
77 yo female with a history of COPD and CHF who presents with sob. Pt states that she has had sob for many months, and was in fact hospitalized for this about one month ago.  After discharge she felt better for a while but over the past few weeks has had worsening sob.  She came to ED this morning because she felt acute worsening while trying to sleep.  Denies CP, palpitations. No LE edema or PND, however she does find it more difficult to breath with lying down and has been sleeping in a chair. Additionally she has had a cough and nasal congestion but denies post nasal drip, fever, or rhinnorhea.  She also denies GERD. She had any episode of myocarditis with associated heart failure in early [**2964**] but per a recent cardiac MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is normal.  In reviewing the prior discharge summary, she also presented with sob after c/o several days of nasal congestion, increasing dyspnea. During this prior hospitalization she had a CTA which showed extensive emphesematous changes.  At that hospitalization it was felt that she had a COPD flare triggered by viral URI. During her hospitalization she had an allergic reaction to [**Last Name (un) **], was discharged off all afterload reducing agents. Only medicine change since discharge was discontinuing her HCTZ yesterday on advisement of her cardiologist b/c she appeared dehydrated.  Of note pt had a cardiac cath in [**3-19**] with no flow limiting lesions. As past of work up for dyspnea she was seen in pulmonary clinic this past week.  Pulmonologist felt that dypnea was in part due to COPD but that her COPD could not account for all of her DOE. Cardiac MR on [**2966-1-21**] with LVEF 62%, but effective forward EF 54%, no evidence of scarring or infarction, RVEF nl at 60%; mild MR.

She completed a course of therapeutic po vanc but as she was to have a course of levofloxacin until [**2968-9-4**] the po vanc was continued as well. The decision to anti-coagulate her for atrial fibrillation was deferred to her outpatient provider. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was discharged to [**Hospital1 9373**]-[**Location (un) 694**] on [**2968-8-26**] for pulmonary rehab. On [**8-30**] a CT chest showed LLL bronchus intra-lumen mucous impaction and LLL actelectasis and infiltrate. There was a right sided pleural effusion with associated atectasis. There was no PE or pneumothorax. On admission she was noted to be ~80% on room air and acutely short of breath while during a bath with the nurse. Prior to transfer she was given solumedrol, levofloxacin (started on [**2968-8-31**]), and vancomycin IV. Of note a vancomycin level was >40 prior to transfer. Upon arrival to the ED, her initial vital signs were 97.9 80 113/73 and 88% on NRB. She was placed on NIPPV. She received nebs and steroids (solumedrol 80mg IV) as well as cefepime/levofloxacin.

Diff colitis x 2 who presented to the ED from home today for evaluation of shortness of breath. The patient reports that she has had a sense of head congestion with rhinorrea for the last three days, associated with some progressive dyspnea. She has also had a chronic cough for the last six months, but it has become productive of yellowish sputum. Today, the patient had a mechanical fall while ambulating with her walker and hit her left chest. EMS was called to the patient's home, however she felt well at the time of their evaluation and did not go to the ED. Later in the day, with increasing dyspnea, she did decided to come to the ED. In the ED, initial vitals were 96.1, 79, 106/57, 20, 98% on RA. She was treated with nebs and PO prednisone and apparently appeared well. She was offered the opportunity for discharge with PCP f/u, however indicated she would feel more comfortable with admission. On arrival to 11 [**Hospital Ward Name 1804**], the patient was quickly noted to be in severe respiratory distress. Additional nebs were administered along with methylprednisolone. The patient was urgently transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] where she was initially unable to provide much history secondary to her respiratory distress. Emperic BPAP was initiated, which the patient tolerated well. Within 15 minutes, she had improved markedly and was able to begin answering some questions. During this period, she was intermittently noted to be tachycardiac as high as the 140s and hypotensive with SBPs in the 70s-80s; this all improved as her respiratory status stabalized. On ROS, the pt endorses pleuritic chest pain just above the right breast where she fell earlier today. She also notes that her LE may be slightly swollen as compared to baseline; she does not believe she has had significant weight gain. No other chest discomfort or palpitations. No fevers or chills.

He has been experiencing progressive chest pain and was referred for left heart catheterization. He was found to have severe aortic stenosis and three vessel disease.
70 year old female who complains of SOB. She awoke from sleep with burning chest pain. She reported stuttering chest pain all day today as with some associated shortness of breath. She states she was last admitted 3 weeks ago with similar symptoms and was diagnosed with a CHF exacerbation. She has been taking her diuretics faithfully since that time. Referred for cardiac catheterization which showed 3V CAD. Subsequently referred for surgery.
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 8363**] is a 71y/o lady with DM2, poorly controlled HTN, CAD s/p NSTEMI&CABG [**12-13**], s/p MV annuloplasty, and systolic/diastolic CHF (EF 55%) who presented with chest pain&dyspnea and is admitted to the CCU due to CHF exacerbation requiring BiPAP. At her recent baseline, she can walk in the mall and do housework as well as going up and down stairs without symptoms of either chest distress or undue dyspnea.  Per ED report, she was doing fine until yesterday when she felt acutely short of breath.  Then she developed left-sided chest pain that radiated to her arm and back. Patient reports that she has had similar chest pain before but it has never radiated and never was associated with shortness of breath.  Her family brought her to the ED. In the ED, initial VS were: pain [**7-13**], T 99.2, HR 88, BP 146/47, RR 24, POx 80% RA.  Was having difficulty completing sentences and was sleepy.  Had rales to mid-lung and CXR confirmed pulmonary edema.  Labs were notable for WBC 12.1, Hct 29.5 (baseline 30), BUN 42/Cr 1.5 (which is baseline), glucose 276, Anion gap 16.  Lactate not checked.  Troponin was 0.04 and BNP was 8300.  EKG revealed SR, rate 88 w/LBBB, negative Sgarbossa's.  She was started on BiPAP on arrival with improvement of her sats to 100%.  She continued to appear tired but VBG did not suggest that she was retaining CO2.  She was started on a NTG drip (currently at 5), as well as receiving Lasix 80mg with 250cc urine output over the next 2 hours.  She also received ASA 325mg PO.  She was unable to be weaned from BiPAP so she was admitted to the CCU.  VS prior to transfer were pain 0/10, T 98.0, HR 78, BP 126/51, RR 19, POx 97%. On arrival to the floor, she is on BiPAP, somnolent but arousable to loud voice.  Follows commands but then dozes off. Denies chest pain currently. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS Unable to assess due to somnolence and BiPAP use.
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a significant past medical history of hypertension, recent urinary tract infection, hypothyroidism, who called EMS on [**3039-2-21**] after feeling unwell and experiencing chest pain.  The patient was found to be unresponsive and a junctional rhythm in the 40s with no palpable pulse in respiratory distress.  She was intubated in the field and received 1 mg atropine with a responsive heart rate 80s, blood pressure 80/palp.  She was taken to the [**Hospital 4008**] Hospital and subsequently transferred to [**Hospital6 1739**] for cardiac catheterization as the patient was felt to be in cardiogenic shock. Catheterization revealed three vessel disease (90% left anterior descending, 90% left circumflex artery, presumed occluded right coronary artery) and septic physiology (SVR 577, cardiac index 4.5, SCV02 82%).  The procedure was complicated by a right iliac dissection necessitating a brachial artery approach.  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for sepsis of unclear etiology. She had a dirty urinalysis at outside hospital with negative urine and negative blood cultures.  There was some concern for aspiration in the setting of her intubation and she was therefore treated empirically with levofloxacin and Flagyl. She was extubated on [**2-22**] but had a new 02 requirement felt likely to be secondary to pulmonary edema.  She received six liters as part of her fluid resuscitation.  Diuresis was complicated by a rising creatinine. At time of transfer to the floor, the patient felt well and denied fever, chills, headache, chest pain and shortness of breath, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname 8425**] is a 61 y/o f with h/o of CAD s/p multiple stents, most recently [**2644-7-11**] ostial RCA Promus and RPDA promus, LCX Taxus, PCI ostial LAD promus for instent restenosis of the RCA, RPDA, LCX and LAD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, rheumatoid arthritis, restrictive lung disease who was transferred from OSH for possible cholangitis. Patient complained of some chest discomfort on the night of [**10-25**] while eating dinner and was noted to have elevated cardiac biomarkers. . Patient reports on [**10-25**] she was eating dinner when she developed sudden onset of head ache [**10-21**] which radiated to her back. She became anxious and then developed throat "heaviness" that subsequently radiated to her chest, which pt states is consistent with her previous anginal and heart attack symptoms. She took NTG and after 5 minutes the pain did not subside so she took another nitroglycerine and then a third which improved the CP slightly. She said the entire episode lasted about 20 minutes. The chest pressure was associated with diaphoresis and SOB but pt denied palpitations, dizziness, nause, vomiting. She was taken to the hospital by her husband and by the time she reached [**Name (NI) 8426**] her chest pressure had subsided completely but she did have some abdominal discomfort. In [**Location (un) **], she was hypotensive and central line was placed. No EKG shown. She was given stress dose steroids and put on pressors. Per report, there were some gallbladder thickening and the initial thought was hypotension/sepsis from a gallbladder source prompting her transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] with for management of possible cholangitis. The week prior she endorsed increasing orthopnea having to sleep upright and also noticed some increase LE swelling for which she was taking [**2-15**] additional lasix 20 mg pills on top of her morning 20 mg lasix. . On presentation to [**Hospital1 1498**], she denies any chest pain or shortness of breath. She also denied abdominal pain. She was also finishing her last day of azithromycin for an upper respiratory infection. She reports that over the last 6 days, she has also noticed increasing LE edema for which she has been taking increasing doses of Lasix. She also complains of worsening orthopnea. She is able to walk [**1-14**] blocks with no chest pain. She can go up 1 flight of stairs but sometime has to stop for SOB. On cardiac review of symptoms as stated above. All other ROS negative.
The patient is a 54 year-old man who was recently discharged on [**9-29**].  He was instructed by renal medicine to hold off on taking his Lasix and Zaroxolyn as he had been over diuresed in the previous three weeks and was admitted to the hospital for rehydration, because of nausea and vomiting.  Unfortunately it is not clear whether the patient was compliant or not, but he began complaining of shortness of breath when lying supine.  This was approximately four hours after discharge.  His symptoms were relieved when he sat up and again recurrent when he tried to lay flat to sleep.  After about four attempts his wife called the ambulance and he was brought back to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 69**]. This is a 54 year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, chronic renal failure/nephrotic syndrome.  After the patient was brought into the Emergency Department he was given intravenous Lasix and successfully diuresed after which his breathing began to grossly improve as well as his O2 sats. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was then admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 8453**] [**Company 189**] Service for triple monitoring of his renal function and hydration status.  During his stay the patient developed one episode of left sided chest pain.  The nature of this episode was not clear as the patient noted that he had one episode of belching followed by a burning sensation followed by left sided chest pain, which is partially relieved by Maalox as well as partially relieved by, according to the patient, one sublingual nitroglycerin. Electrocardiogram taken at that time showed no changes with previous electrocardiograms and no rise in cardiac enzymes were noted when these chemistries were sent off. Of note, the patient's chemistries were somewhat ambiguous upon admission, though he had no initial complaints of chest pain except for the episode described above.  Troponin I was elevated.  CKMB remained within normal limits and CK was elevated.  Given the patient's renal failure as well as notatin of laboratory before that initial samples were moderately hemolyzed.  It was initially believed that the elevated troponin number and CK numbers were believed to be a combination of both hemolysis as well as the patient's renal function that in conjunction with the patient being asymptomatic with no chest pain and no noted electrocardiogram changes. The patient was monitored.  However, after the episode of belching with the left sided chest pain cardiology felt that given his past cardiac history including a prior myocardial infarction treated with coronary artery bypass graft and stent placement that they should evaluate him for cardiac catheterization.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**10-4**].  The catheterization report indicated he had 70% stenosis in proximal right coronary artery.  The mid right coronary artery was DICTATION ENDS ABRUPTLY [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1550**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8454**], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 8455**] Dictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8456**] MEDQUIST36 D:  [**3334-10-10**]  23:00 T:  [**3334-10-18**]  05:32 JOB#:  [**Job Number 8457**]
This 74 year old male with severe COPD and extensive cardiac history in [**2689-10-26**]. Since surgery in [**2689-10-26**], patient has always complained of a sternal click and incisional discomfort. This finding was confirmed at his postoperative visit in [**2689-12-26**]. At that time, his incisional discomfort was described as mild and did not affect his routine ADL's. However over the last several weeks following another bout of pneumonia with significant coughing episodes, his sternal click and incisional discomfort have significantly worsened. Currently, he rates his pain 10 out of 10 and is no longer able to function. He denies fevers, chills,palpitations, orthopnea, PND, syncope and pedal edema. He has just completed a course of Prednisone and Levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia. The  ACE inhibitor was also recently stopped due to persistent dry cough. He presents for surgical repair.
The patient has a long complicated cardiac history, who underwent a re-do sternotomy which was complicated by a sterile dehiscence. Back earlier in the year, he had a plating done which unfortunately lead to infection required for plate removal.  He had a long postoperative course including an air leak from his left lung that took weeks and weeks to heal.  He was seen in the office periodically with seroma fluid but nothing of major importance and then suddenly the day prior to admission developed a very large collection. CT scan did not show a source of bleeding and ther was no sign of contrast in the hematoma at the time of the CT.  He was brought to the operating room for evacuation.
HPI: Briefly, this is a 71 yo M with a history of CAD s/p CABGx4, vascular dementia, ESRD on HD, prior TIAs, and recent postive stress test, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after sustaining a L femoral neck fx after a mechanical fall.  ED workup normal except for hip fx and EKG showing sinus brady with first degree AV block and inferolateral abnormalities. Intention for OR to fix hip, but in light of recent stress results demonstrating reversible inferolateral changes, needs clearance from cardiac standpoint before OR. . This morning, he complains of [**7-10**] pain in his left hip and some minor discomfort in his lower back.  Otherwise, he feels well, and denies CP and SOB. . Review of systems: (+) Per HPI, + orthopnea (2 pillows, 6-8 months), + chronic LBP (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations, PND, peripheral edema. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
History of Present Illness (per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 8482**]: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 4578**] is a 71 year old male w/ past medical history of ESRD via  a LUE AVG presents for evaluation for infected AVG. Call from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at Care- Mr. [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8483**] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) **] AVG was found to be thrombosed at his chronic HD unit in [**Hospital1 **]. Pt. was sent to AV Care for a thrombectomy where the graft was evaluated and felt to be infected. Pt's last HD was on Monday. He has a h/o prior graft infection and revision.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 1493**] is a 47 year-old man with HIV/AIDS (CD4 8, VL [**Numeric Identifier 8531**] on [**3109-11-15**]; compliant with HAART; history of high-grade resistance patterns; no history of OIs; diagnosed [**3098**]; presumed contracted from MSM contact) who presented to the Emergency Dept today with six days of worsening bipedal edema, exertional dyspnea, and fevers.  He reports a gradual worsening of his symptoms over the past six days.  His exertional dyspnea has worsened to the extent that he is dyspneic at rest.  He has had frequent coughing which is mostly dry, but occasionally was producing [**Doctor Last Name 347**] sputum.  He has been having daily fevers as high as 102, along with chills and sweats.  His PO intake has been decreased, but he has been forcing himself to drink fluids.  He has developed worsening orthopnea (now using 7 pillows at night; usually uses 3 pillows).  He has been compliant with all of his medications, including his HAART and his Bactrim prophylaxis. When his symptoms began, he decided to increase his Bactrim use to 3 DS tabs daily.  He has not had sick contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] did receive this year's influenza vaccine and OMR indicates that he received the Pneumovax in [**3104**]. . He saw one of his PCP's colleagues earlier today and was afebrile with a BP of 94/64, HR 100, and O2 sat of 94% on room air.  A CXR was interpreted (on a wet read) as showing bilateral opacities consistent with an opportunistic infection such as Pneumocystis.  He was referred to the Emergency Department for further evaluation. . On presentation to the ED, he was afebrile with a BP of 115/83, HR 115, and O2 sat (by report) in the low-90s on room air. An ABG at this time was 7.53/29/63.  He was noted by the triage RN to be in some respiratory distress and was placed on CPAP, with improvement in his O2sat up to 100%.  Out of concern for Pneumocystis pneumonia, he was given 400mg of IV Bactrim and 60mg of prednisone.  His ECG was noted to have new T-wave depressions in V2-V5, and a troponin-T was 1.67, BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 7828**].  He was given a 325mg aspirin.  Since this was thought to likely be demand ischemia in the setting of an acute pulmonary process, no anticoagulation was started after discussion by the ED team with the cardiology consultant on call.  He was also noted to have a worsening of his baseline anemia and was consented for a blood transfusion (but was transferred to the MICU before the blood had arrived to the ED).  Prior to transfer to the MICU, an ABG on CPAP 7/5 with FiO2 50% was 7.48/33/247. . Review of Systems: Notable for some mild chest discomfort while coughing (much different from the patient's history of anginal pain).  He denies any weight loss, hemoptysis, visual changes, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or hematochezia.
48 year-old man with HIV/AIDS (CD4 28, VL 65 [**3110-12-1**]; compliant with HAART), CAD, chronic systolic and diastolic CHF (EF 30%) who presented to [**Hospital 8534**] Hospital with respiratory failure and NSTEMI. He presented to the office of his PCP [**1-13**] for a three-week history of productive cough and was started on levofloxacin 750 mg without improvement. He was admitted to [**Hospital 8534**] Hospital [**3111-1-23**] with dyspnea and was intubated in the ED. Partner states he was febrile to 102 the day of admission. Chest x-ray with pulmonary edema but no significant consolidation. He was started on vancomycin/zosyn and continued on levofloxacin for broad coverage of pneumonia.

This is a 59 year-old female with a past medical history of mitral regurgitation and nonischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction estimated to be about 10 to 15%.  The patient presented to an outside hospital on the [**2733-5-22**] with a chief complaint of chest pain.  At that time she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and started on Lovenox, Integrilin and aspirin.  The Intensive Care Unit team was unable to start the patient on a beta blocker given her hypotension. She had cardiac enzymes drawn with a peak CK in the 60s and a troponin 1 that peaked at 0.41.  On the [**5-23**] the patient complained of increasing shortness of breath and a chest x-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusions.  The patient was diurese as her blood pressure tolerated.  She was started on a Dobutamine drip and transferred to another outside hospital for further evaluation and catheterization. The patient underwent a catheterization on the [**5-24**], which revealed no significant coronary artery disease.  It did, however, reveal she had elevated right heart pressures with right atrial pressures of 18, 17, 15 and left heart pressures with a wedge of 27, 29, 23.  Cardiac output of 2.37 with an index of 1.37.  The patient was found to have +4 mitral regurgitation with global hypokinesis.  An echocardiogram was performed, which confirmed the results of the catheterization and estimated her ejection fraction at about 10 to 20%.  The patient remained on a Dobutamine drip and was seen by the cardiac surgery team who recommended further evaluation for possible heart transplant.  The patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] on the [**5-28**] for an evaluation for a heart transplant. Upon arrival the patient was stable.  She had no chest pain, shortness of breath, heart palpitations.  She denied lightheadedness or dizziness.  She does report that at home she has three pillow orthopnea.  She has limited physical activity secondary to dyspnea on exertion and she denies any recent weight changes or lower extremity edema.

Ms [**Known patient lastname 9459**] is a 54 y/o F with DM2, HTN, 3vCAD (s/p MI s/p RCA stent in [**3471**]), EtOH and tobacco abuse, h/o depression/PTSD, transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU on [**8-24**] from [**Hospital 481**] Hospital for VF arrest on [**8-23**], shocked in the field. Pt was in her USOH until [**8-23**]. In the evening she cooked dinner for her husband, then watched a movie and went to bed. At around 1am, she woke her husband up with substernal chest pain. She thook sublingual NTG, which resolved the pain immediately. Approximately 15minutes later, the patient again experience chest pain. Her husband called 911, and by the time he returned to her side, she began to slump in her chair and became unconscious, eyes "rolling back", no incontinence. EMS arrived 2 minutes after this episode, found her to be in v-fib and proceeded to electric defibrillation. The shock resulted in a perfusing rhythm. She was intubated in the field, received 200mg IV lidocaine and was started on IV fluids. She was taken to [**Hospital6 3057**], where she was started on dopamine for persistent hypotension. She was also started on heparin and eptifibatide drips for ACS and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cardiac cath. At [**Hospital1 18**], she was taken immediately to the cath lab where she was found to have moderate 3 vessel disease with a "hazy lesion" in OM-1 that was stented with a BMS. Concomitant TTE verified severe global left ventricular dysfunction (EF ~20-25%), repeat documented improvement with Ef ~45%. ROS unattainable at time of transfer, pt intubated and sedated.

This is a 56 y/o male with coronary artery disease s/p LAD stent placement, IDDM, and tracheomalacia s/p tracheal stent, who presented to the ED after 5 days of progressive shortness of breath and cough.  His symptoms first developed 5 days ago as progressive SOB (can walk 2 flights of stairs at baseline, then down to 1/2 flight), cough productive of yellow and pink tinged sputum, and pleuritic right-sided chest pain, rated [**3230-9-16**].  The pain was present all of the time and worse with coughing or movement. He also began using home O2 that he does not normally require. In addition he complained of increasing bilateral lower extremity edema and increasing abdominal girth. He called his primary care physician and was told to take extra lasix (apparently up to 240mg daily per patient report) without success. He then presented to an episodic visit yesterday where a chest xray showed a new right upper lobe pneumonia. He was hypoxic (87% on RA) in clinic and he was referred to the ED for further evaluation.  He denies any recent sick contacts, antibiotic exposure, or travel.  He has had no chest pain, fever, chills, night sweats, abdominal pain, diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum, melena, or rash.  He denies orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Of note, patient was pushed down a flight of stairs in spring [**3227**], and he sustained multiple rib fractures and continues to experience low back pain.

Initial O2 Sat in the ED was 90% on 4L NC.He was also given levofloxacin for pneumonia prior to being admitted to the floor. On exam he was resting and talking comfortably in bed with mild wheezing and productive cough. Cough and small movements elicited extreme pain. The pt was scheduled to get a CTA on his first night. He was sitting watching television  and had sudden onset worsening of his right pleuritic chest pain. He got up to try to walk it off but as he walked he developed a tightening/pressure sensation in his mid-abdomen which then moved up towards his chest and ultimately developed acute "throat-closing" sensation. He called the nurse and was found to be 83% 6L NC. He was acutely short of breath and had difficulty speaking. He was most comfortable in a standing position. Initial SBP 170s. He was given 2 mg IV Morphine, 2 SL NTG, 125 solumedrol, combivent neb, 20 mg Lasix and was started on heparin IV with initial bolus, empirically. Pt was transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. He responded to 97% on 5L at transfer to the MICU. When transferring from the stretcher to the bed, the patient again had an acute shortness of breath with pressure in his chest and a throat-closing sensation. He responded to standing and slow deep breathing after approximately 1 minute. The pt was started on Heparin drip empirically for presumed PE and vancoymcin was added to antibiotic regimen. CTA the next day did not show evidence of PE, hypoxia was resolved, and patient was transferred back to medicine floor.

This is a 45-year-old woman with a history of complete AV node block as a complication of mitral valve replacement, controlled by pacemaker, who developed CHF with dyspnea on exertion and fatigue in [**2738-5-28**]. Echocardiogram at that time demonstrated global hypokinesis of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 30%-40%. She was begun on beta-blocker for the CHF, but was unable to tolerate the drug secondary to bradycardia and increased dyspnea. She presented for placement of a dual- chamber pacemaker, as synchronized AV pacing will improve her tolerance of beta-blocker and CHF.
Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 9992**] is a 46-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure, mitral valve repair, complete heart block and asthma who was admitted to the hospital for heparinization prior to a planned redo mitral valve replacement with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient originally had a mechanical valve placed about 10 years ago, she developed complete heart block and had a pacemaker placed after the mitral valve surgery. While she was having her pacemaker replaced in [**2738-7-28**], she developed a mitral valve thrombus, followed by a successful thrombolysis, however, a TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram) done at that time, revealed the mitral valve failure, and she was scheduled for surgery.  Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 9992**] says her goal INR since then has been 3 to 4.  She was recently admitted for surgery but it was delayed because she had an INR that was greater than 5.  She was discharged with daily INR checks and told to return to [**Hospital1 **] MC when her INR was less than 3.5. On the day of admission, her INR is 2 and she comes to [**Hospital1 **] MC for heparinization prior to her catheterization and mitral valve surgery.
The patient presented on [**7-30**] at [**Hospital6 2863**] with 24 hours of worsening mental status changes and bilateral upper extremity swelling.  Patient has a past medical history of being a nursing home resident, dementia with behavioral disturbance/depressed features, recent admission to [**Hospital 1456**] Hospital with urosepsis of unknown etiology requiring intubation, and discharged on [**3359-9-25**], diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease status post MI, CHF, COPD, status post pacemaker placement, which required replacement for low battery in [**Month (only) 400**] of this year. At the outside hospital, a chest CT with contrast was performed, which showed obstruction of the superior vena cava at the level of the origin of the SVC.  A head CT was also done which was negative with no acute hemorrhage, an old left frontal infarct, and thalamic calcifications and cortical atrophy. It was uncertain what the etiology of obstruction was and ultimately the patient was started on Heparin drip and transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation and possible intervention.  At the time of the arrival of the patient to the Emergency Room, the patient was slightly febrile at 101.4.  Had a blood pressure of 124/84.  Pulse of 105.  Breathing at 30 and sating 94% on room air.  Vascular Surgery evaluated the patient and recommended a venogram and a possible SVC stent at that time. Patient was admitted for further workup.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10588**] is an 84-year-old gentleman with a history of CAD s/p LAD stenting in [**3050**], who has known diastolic heart failure with a normal LVEF (70%). He also has a history of tachy-brady syndrome and underwent a permanent pacemaker placement. In [**Month (only) 1082**], was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with dyspnea and treated for a presumed CHF exacerbation. Trop at OSH was 0.07 (indeterminate) and had increased O2 requirement. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization which revealed nonobstructive CAD. He was evaluated for aortic valve treatment options. After informed consent including full explanation of risks vs. benefits, he was enrolled into the high risk arm of the [**Hospital1 10589**]/TAVI study. He met all inclusion criteria, and did not meet any exclusion criteria, was screened and accepted to be randomized to either [**Hospital1 10589**]/TAVI or surgical AVR as per study protocol. Patient was admitted from [**3056-3-2**] - [**3056-3-7**] for optimization of cardiac status prior to randomization in [**Month/Day/Year 10589**] study. Patient was randomized into [**Month/Day/Year **] arm, which he will receive during this hospitalization.  During te last hospitalization, he was started on Pradaxa in preparation for procedure. Patient given clear instructions to stop taking Pradaxa 3 days prior to procedure (on [**3056-3-15**]). He was also diuresed with lasix and achieved euvolemia, maintained on 2L oxygen, which he is on at home. Since his last discharge, patient has been feeling well.  He had one episode of severe epistaxis requiring packing by an ENT at [**Hospital 872**] Hospital.

The patient is a 76 year-old man with known history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure and valvular disease.  He recently underwent cardiac catheterization for shortness of breath and to evaluate his known mitral regurgitation.  The cardiac catheterization revealed two vessel coronary artery disease, severe mitral regurgitation, mild systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction and severe pulmonary hypertension.  Specifically there was a 70% stenosis of the left circumflex, 30% stenosis of the right coronary artery and 70% stenosis of the posterior descending coronary artery .  The estimated ejection fraction was 42%.  The patient presented to the service for mitral valve repair after the planned procedure was postponed approximately two weeks ago secondary to cellulitis of the right calf, which was treated with antibiotics for ten days prior to admission.  On the day of admission the patient denied any chest pain.  He does complain of mild exertional shortness of breath with activities such as climbing stairs.  He denies any claudication, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lightheadedness.  He does have chronic lower extremity edema.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6251**] is a 67 year-old African American male with a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, h/o heroin abuse, and end-stage renal disease s/p cadaveric transplant in [**3407**], who presented to [**Hospital3 **]??????s Medical Center on [**3413-10-7**] with complaint of dyspnea on exertion over the two days PTA.  He denied associated chest pain, palpitations, cough, nausea, vomiting, fevers, and chills. He also denied change in urine output, hematuria, dysuria, and recent NSAID use.  In the Emergency Department at the OSH, he was noted to be hypertensive (169/78), and his physical exam was consistent with CHF.  He was given 40 mg IV Lasix with good response (1 L urine output).  Lab data on admission was notable for a BUN/ Cr of 36/3.3 and HCT = 28.4. Urinalysis showed 1+ protein, and sediment was remarkable for an occasional RBC and WBC, with no evidence of dysmorphic RBCs, muddy brown casts, or red cell casts. * At the OSH, the patient was evaluated by the Nephrology staff. The patient was administered all of his medications except his enalapril.  He was monitored for signs of heroin withdrawal. His cardiac enzymes were notable for a CK of 93, MB of 3.3, and troponin value of 0.2. The patient underwent an ECHO which disclosed an EF of 70% and mild LVH. * On the day of admission to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was noted to have persistently elevated blood pressures (220/106) at the OSH.  Per report, the patient remained asymptomatic.  He was given his usual blood pressure medications, as well as does of Labetalol (20 mg IV, 600 mg PO), Hydralazine (20 mg IV, 50 mg PO), Clonidine (0.2 mg/24 hr patch, 0.1 mg PO), and Nitropaste (3 inches). Despite administration of these medications, the patient??????s SBP remained >200. Given patient??????s persistent hypertension and acute renal failure, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up and management, including renal biopsy in the setting a post-transplant patient. * The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for acute care and evaluation of his renal failure.  A renal ultrasound was obtained which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis, as well as patent vasculature.  The Renal service was also consulted.  On transfer to the floor, the patient reported doing well.  He denied CP/SOB, N/V, diarrhea, abdominal pain, HA, or dizziness.
79 yo russian speaking only male c hx of CAD, COPD, asthma, afib with 7 day hx of increasing right sided weakness with acute worsening 2-3 hours ago.  Patient states that he has felt unsteady over this time period and daughter states that he fell approximately 3 days ago and has been dragging his R leg over the last 1-2 days.  Slurred speech per daughter tonight and he had difficulty holding on to a cup of water with his right hand. Patient has had no visual changes and denies headache.
81 yo M being admitted to CCU for aspirin desensitization prior to RLE angiogram scheduled for [**3-30**]. He has been having worsening RLE pain with ambulation that is partially relieved by rest. A CT angiogram was performed showing significant arterial disease. Given his PAD and CAD, it is important for him to be on aspirin, but he has been resistant to this. He was reportedly told by his physicians in [**Country 526**] to never again take aspirin, and this is for unclear reasons. Given his need for intervention, as well as worsening CAD and PAD, he is electively admitted to the CCU for aspirin desensitization. . On arrival to the floor, patient is feeling well and has no complaints.
[**Age over 90 **] yof with a hx of [**Last Name (un) 305**] body dementia, CAD s/p MI, hypertension who presented with increased confusion per family x 3 days. The patient had not been eating well, and had been less verbal than at baseline. Per son, at baseline patient has contractures and is difficult to interact with. If you ask her questions she mumbles as if she is trying to answer. She is frequently agitated.  However, over the past 3 days she has had decreased PO intake, and seems more agitated and even more difficult to communicate with than at baseline. The son notes that she was this way 4 years ago when she had a UTI. No documented fevers at home, though patient is nonverbal. In the ED initial vitals were T 97.6 HR 88 BP 111/78 RR 16 98% on RA. The patient was noted to have generalized body twitching and upward gaze. UA was positive and she was given IV Ciprofloxacin. CT head was negative for any acute process. She was admitted to the medicine floor earlier this evening.  At time of transfer to the floor, she was satting at 96% on 2L (unclear room air saturation).  Had been receiving IVFs during night - total 1 L since ED course.  Nightfloat resident was callled for tachypnea and apparent respiratory distress.  Resp rate was in 40s with sats dropping into 80s and low 90s, requiring 5L O2 to maintain sats >90%.  ABG 7.45/28/71 with lactate that had risen to 3.5. Respiratory was called for suctioning without significant improvement.  Patient was given clinda and levoflox for concern of aspiration.  She also received 20 IV lasix followed by 40 IV lasix without significant improvement in respiratory status or urine output.  CXR demonstrated new pulmonary edema, and less likely infiltrate.
77 M with history of HTN, HL, CAD s/p CABG, Afib, DMII, presents with acute onset of diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. . Mr [**Known patient lastname 10685**] was in usual state of health until lunch yesterday when he developed poor appetite and nausea that worsened throughout the day. In the evening he developed acute onset abdominal pain in the epigastrium that radiated to his back. He had two episodes of non bloody emesis prompting self referral to the ED.  He denies any fevers, chills, CP, SOB, dyspnea, diarrhea, BRBPR, melena. He endorses single episode of small of amount his blood in his urine. . In the ED inital vitals were, 96.8 92 156/68 18 89%.  Physical exam was notable for tender RUQ and epigastrum.  Labs showed leukocytosis to 17.4. lipase of 4050, and elevated LFTs and bilirubin.  CT scan showed concern for cholecystitis as it showed distended gallbladder with multiple stones with small foci of air in nondependent areas.  There was no definitive evidence of wall thickening, stranding or duct dilation. Patient then spiked a fever to 101.5.  Surgery and ERCP were consulted given concern for an impacted stone and cholangitis. He received a total of 3 L of IV fluids, unasyn 3g IV, morphine 10 mg, and zofran.  Tentative plan is to have INR reversed with FFP and go for ERCP.  Vitals prior to transfer: 76 108/50 17 95% 2L . On arrival to the ICU, initial vitals were: 97.6 82 121/52 95% RA 17.

Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 10693**] is an 89 year old woman with HTN, COPD, mild aortic stenosis, paroxysmal afib (on coumadin), hypothyroidism, and recent gram negative bacteremia (pseudomonas), presenting with nausea, vomiting, hypotension and bradycardia one day after discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] after a complicated stay. . Patient has had repeated admission in the recent past, most recently after presenting with dyspnea on exertion and nausea. She was found to have positive blood cultures, ([**12-8**]) for pseudomonas. She was treated with Ceftriaxone and Ciprofloxacin and discharged to rehab facility. . Today, patient was found hypotensive and bradycardic at her nursing home, with SBP in 80's and HR in the 50's. She was brought to the ED, where her vitals were T 100/9, HR 68, BP 130/40, RR 18, O2 sat 99% 6L NC. Shortly thereafter, patient became bradycardic with HR to 30's and BP to 80's. ECG obtained revealed complete heart block with junctional escape rhythm. Patient was given atropine x 2, glucagon with little improvement. Patient continued having nausea and vomiting, and was obtunded. She was intubated for airway protection and EP was consulted. Initially plan was to place temporary pacer wire, while she was bridged with Dopamine, with good improvement in heart rate, at which time decision not to pursue temp wire was made. Patient was given calcium gluconate, also with improvement in heart rate. CT Torso was obtained, which was only remarkable for a small left pleural effusion and bilateral shoulder effusions. Patient was transferred to CCU for further management. Review of systems not obtainable, patient intubated.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10707**] is a 55 year old man with recently diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 30%), current tobacco use and past IV drug and alcohol abuse (clean x10 years) who p/w progressive shortness of breath. . The patient was in his USOH until a few months ago when he noticed increasing shortness of breath during his regular weight-training exercise circuit.  While he used to be able to do several sets without stopping, he soon found that he needed to stop every few sets to catch his breath.  While he used to be able to walk indefinitely, he now doubts that he could go for more than a mile.  The episodes of shortness of breath have not been associated with any chest pain.  Over the past few weeks he has also begun to notice PND and orthopnea, although he denies any lower extremity edema or recent weight gain (baseline weight 173-175).  He reports a nonproductive cough, but notes that he has it chronically and that it's likely related to his smoking. He denies any recent fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting or palpitations. . Over the past ~2 weeks he has also experienced periodic episodes of chest pain that are unrelated in time to his episodes of shortness of breath.  He describes the pain as "burning," and notes that it's located in the mid-epigastric area.  The episodes of pain last varying amounts of time (5 - 30 minutes). The pain does not radiate, and is not associated with any lightheadedness, diaphoresis, nausea or vomiting.  He notes that the pain is similar to his reflux pain, and that it typically improves with food or drink. . Finally, the patient notes that he has had "eye waviness" for "the longest time."  Approximately 2 months ago he "went blind in one eye" while waiting in line at a store.  It is unclear what workup was pursued at that time but an ultrasound of his carotids was normal.  Last week he experienced an episode of "eye blurriness" while he was working to fix an air conditioner; it lasted about 15 minutes.  In both cases, the eye symptoms have not been associated with any headache, aura, chest pain or shortness of breath, but he does recall some lightheadedness. . On the floor the patient complained of some epigastric pain but notes that it was imrpoving as he ate.  He denied any shortness of breath or eye symptoms.
The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 69**] with melena and decreasing hematocrit.  She was told that she "passed out" earlier on the day of admission, but the patient was unable to further describe this episode. In the Emergency Department, the patient was tachycardic to 120 with a systolic blood pressure in the 110s.  She was given 4 units of fresh frozen plasma, 2 mg of vitamin K intravenously, and 1.8 liters of intravenous fluids.

His current symptoms include dyspnea on exertion, worsening fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance. He is status post CABG in [**2757**] followed by mitral valve repair (via right thoracotomy)in [**2759**]. Echocardiogram has revealed mod-severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. He is currently in atrial fibrillation. His symptoms have improved since being switched from Dofetilide to Digoxin. Currently denies chest pain, orthopnea, PND and pedal edema. He is now referred for surgical intervention.
55M with CHF who is admitted from Dr.[**Name (NI) 3487**] clinic for diuresis. Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] has h/o AFIB, CAD s/p MI [**2749**] and CABG + MVR [**2757**], re-do MVR [**2759**] and most recently in [**2-/2766**] underwent tricuspid valvuloplasty + MVR + [**Hospital1 **]-atrial MAZE. Subsequently had worsening fluid retention and admitted to cardiac [**Doctor First Name **] [**3-11**] for exacerbation of congestive heart failure. Echo revealed normal working bioprosthetic mitral valve and no TR. Was gently IV diuresed with lasix gtt and discharged home after 6 day hospital course. Subsequently underwent successful cardioversion on [**4-5**] for his AF followed by a plasmapheresis for his high LDL [**4-6**]. Over the past week has noticed worsening leg edema, increased abdominal girth and decreased exertional tolerance - short of breath at twenty paces.  He increased lasix from 40 to 60 on [**4-4**] then 60 to 80mg [**Hospital1 **] 4 days ago without improvement. He is currently 217lb and says his dry weight is 205. This morning felt especially weak and malaised, had trouble sleeping at night. Saw Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 432**] in clinic who referred him to the CCU for further treatment. He denies any recent symptom of febrile/infectious illness. Denies food indiscretion. He has been taking his medications w/o fail. He denies recent chest pain. He denies orthopnea, PND. Reports nocturia X1. On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence syncope or presyncope. See HPI otherwise.
Mr [**Known patient lastname **] is 55 year old man with CHF (EF 25%) and multiple prior hospitalizations for decompensated heart failure, AFIB, CAD w/ MI in [**2749**],  CABG in [**2757**], mitral valve repair in [**2759**], 3rd redo sternotomy in [**2766-2-25**] for tricuspid valvuloplasty, mitral valve replacement and biatrial maze procedure, now directly admitted from Dr.[**Name (NI) 3487**] office for repeat CHF exacerbation. Pt was in his usual state of health until ~ 1 wk ago when he started feel "bloated and filling up with fluid." Pt states that he has been very careful about his diet and especially his sodium intake. He has mildly increased shortness of breath and a dry cough. He also has fatigue and back pain that he attributes to his weight gain. He weighs himself daily and reports gaining at least 10 extra pounds, including 3 pounds yesterday. Pt was recently on vacation in [**State 1708**], and denies sick contacts or unusual exposures. He denies fever, chills, or changes in appetite. He has not had any chest pain, palpitations, nausea or vomiting, headaches, diarrhea, constipation, or urinary problems. Pt was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2766-6-14**] after treatment for CHF exacerbation during which Pt was diuresed ~ 9 L w/ a furosemide iv drip titrated up to 30mg /hr and 3-4L urine output daily. Pt was underwent plasmapheresis ~2 wks prior but had to stop early due to lightheadedness. Pt believes this contributed to his weight-gain. In clinic, Pt's vitals were BP 128/72, HR 62, weighed 201 lbs, and Pt was directly admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]. Upon transfer to the floor, Pt was stable w/ little shortness of breath. Vitals were: 96.1F, 131/76, 88, 20, 100% RA, 90.7kg.
This is a 63-year-old woman with a history of lung cancer (adenocarcinoma) status post resection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with multiple hospital admissions for pneumonia, insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus, who initially presented to the Emergency Room on the [**3434-6-12**] complaining of dyspnea. The patient was found to be hypoxic and hypotensive in the Emergency Room.  She complained of increasing shortness of breath and a cough productive for a small amount of reddish-brown sputum for approximately one week prior to admission.  She also complained of subjective fevers of approximately 101. REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  The patient complained of chills, nausea.  Denies vomiting and diarrhea.  The patient reports that at baseline, she is fatigued and weak.  The family notes a gradual decline in her physical function over the past six months.  This morning the patient was found to be dramatically more short of breath and was transported to the Emergency Department by EMS.  Her O2 saturations on room air were found to be 77% with an initial blood pressure of 120/90.  Her O2 saturations increased to approximately 90% on a nonrebreather, but her systolic blood pressure dropped to the 70's systolic. The patient was given 1-2 liters of IV fluid, and then was gently weaned off her nonrebreather on to a nasal cannula mask.  Patient was also found to have an anion gap of 21 and given her history of insulin dependent diabetes, was bolused with 5 units of insulin and started on an insulin drip.
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with diabetes and a past history of lung cancer who is status post bilateral upper lobectomies. Over the past year, the patient has had problems with persistent pneumonia and an effusion on the right side that was thought to be due to a mechanical narrowing and kinking of her right middle lobe bronchi resulting in a right middle lobe syndrome.  A video thoracoscopy had identified the right middle lobe as a small, and voluted, and chronically infected structure. After a long discussion with the patient, her family, and her primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was determined that the most reasonable course of action was surgical resection given that the only other alternative would be likely frequent readmissions for a persistent pneumonia and effusions on this right side. CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Thus, on [**3434-10-1**], the patient was taken for a right middle lobectomy and a tracheobronchoplasty.  Immediately postoperatively, the patient was able to be extubated but had some mucoid secretions that plugged her lower lube bronchi, resulting in respiratory distress.  The patient had to be intubated again, and at bronchoscopy a mucous plug was evacuated, and the patient was able to be subsequently extubated. Unfortunately, this problem happened again, and the patient had to be reintubated, and again underwent a therapeutic bronchoscopy. At this point, the patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit where she was monitored very closely for evidence of a recurrent mucous plugging of her lower lobe bronchi. On postoperative day two, the patient had a bedside percutaneous tracheostomy placed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 939**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 940**] to facilitate aggressive pulmonary toilet. Over the next several days, we were able to wean her ventilatory support and progressed quite rapidly to having the patient on tracheostomy mask during the day with some ventilatory support at night. The patient had intermittent episodes of recurrent mucous plugging of her right lower lobe bronchi; at which point we performed expeditious therapeutic bronchoscopies to evacuate the mucous plugging and to reexpand her lower lobe. The patient initially improved and stabilized and was actually to progress toward using a Passy-Muir valve. However, approximately two weeks postoperatively she developed a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.  Despite early and aggressive antibiotic therapy, as well as intermittent therapeutic bronchoscopies, the patient progressively deteriorated.  We attempted to optimize her nutrition by feeding her through her previously placed gastrostomy tube and having her work with the physical therapist as much as possible; which included taking daily walks around the Intensive Care Unit. However, over the next three weeks, this pneumonia settled into the basilar segments of her right lower lobe and she became progressively depressed and physically fatigued. Early in her hospitalization, we requested the assistance of the Psychiatry Service in managing her depressed mood as well as her anxiety.  They were very helpful in getting her on an appropriate medication regimen including Remeron and Seroquel with as needed Ativan. Over the ensuing weeks, the patient began to express a dissatisfaction with her continued tube feeds and positive pressure ventilation at night.  After an extensive discussion with her husband, her daughters (including one daughter who is a clinical psychologist), and the patient; it was felt that the situation with her limited pulmonary reserve in the face of this unremitting pneumonia would not likely allow her to be off life support in the near future.  Consequently, she requested that the life saving measures be discontinued and that she be allowed to expire comfortably. Thus, on [**3434-11-7**], in the presence of her family, we placed the patient on a tracheostomy mask.  She was able to say her final good byes, and we initiated a low-dose morphine drip to eliminate any air hunger, after which she expired. CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was deceased. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1.  Status post right middle lobectomy and tracheobronchoplasty on [**3434-10-1**]. 2.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.

86yo Chinese-speaking man with h/o dCHF admitted on [**9-2**] with 3d L-sided hip pain and fever. Mild O2 requirement, 93% on 3L NC, WBC 16.5, and CXR with old L base opacity, started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for empiric treatment of CAP. He had a witnessed aspiration event with liquids at ~0230 on [**9-4**]. RR 28, desatted to 84-88% RA, 90-91% 4L NC. Noted to have bibasilar crackles on exam. He was given 1 ipratropium neb treatment with little response. He was also given 40mg IV Lasix, to which he put out approximately 400cc of urine. Repeat CXR showed possible new RML opacity. On conversation with son, the patient denies chest pain and shortness of breath. He was transferred to the MICU for worsening hypoxia and possible CO2 retention. In ICU found to have aspiration pneumonia and treated with BiPAP and antibiotics  with some improvement. Sent to floor on [**9-11**]
This is an 89 year old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, hypertension and end stage congestive heart failure who was found down in his living room 2 days prior to admission.  He hit his head but denied history of loss of consciousness.  He initially was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 614**] where CT neck revealed a C2 fracture.  He was tranferred to this hospital for further management. In the ED, initial vs were: T: 97.3 P: 130 BP: 124/78 R: 28 O2 sat 100% on NRB. Patient was given two liters of normal saline, morhine 2 mg IV x 1, zofran 4 mg IV x 1 and metoprolol 5 mg IV x 1. He was admitted to the TSICU for further management. Since arrival to the TSICU he has had an MRI which shows a type II odontoind fracture.  He also has had a right forearm xray which revealed distal radial and ulnar styloid fractures which have been casted.  He has been in a c-collar throughout.  While in the TSICU he has been noted to be inattentive and inconsistent answering questions with periods of frank agitation where he has been combative and refusing care.  He has required haldol and zyprexa PRN for these symptoms.  Per discussion with the patient's son, at baseline his speech is interpretable 50% of the time and that he often talks about the past. He was briefly transferred to the floor on [**3234-10-6**].  There he was receiving gentle hydration as well as PRN zyprexa, haldol and morphine.  He was noted to be tachycardic and received significant doses of PRN metoprolol although telemetry strips appear to show sinus tachycardiac versus MAT.  He was initially requiring 35% facemask but this required titration during the day.  He was also noted to be increasingly somnolent.  Of note his lasix has been held since admission and on the day of intubation he received lasix 40 mg IV x 2 without significant increase in his urine output.  He was ultimately intubated for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.  ABG at the time of intubation was 7.29/65/85 on a non-rebreather.  Peri-intubation he was transiently hypotensive and required neosynephrine.  He had a non-contrast CT of the test which showed a possible pneumonia versus atelectasis.  He was started on vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin for presumed hospital acquired pneumonia given an isolated fever to 102 degrees.  Subclavian line was attempted but was unsuccessful and a femoral line was placed for access.  He also had an arterial line placed and an NGT to allow for tube feeds. He is now being transferrd to the MICU for management of respiratory failure.

Patient was in his usual state of health (stable NYHA Class IIIb) until [**2781-10-20**] when he underwent surgery for incarcerated ventral hernia. He was D/C'd on Prandin 0.5 t.i.d. with meals.  On [**2781-11-10**], the patient had an episode of hypoglycemia requiring admission to [**Hospital3 **], and was D/C'd from [**Hospital3 9589**] off all glycemic agents.  Patient's PCP, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1942**] started Glipizide 2.5 for consistently elevated serum glucose levels. On date of admission, the patient awoke diaphoretic with shortness of breath.  His finger glucose at that time was measured to be 50.  In the [**Hospital1 186**] ED, he received 3 amps of D50 with symptomatic improvement.  The patient was without chest pain, headache, nausea, vomiting.  He did have increased shortness of breath. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for increased ascites over the past five months with no pedal edema.
This is a 69 year old female with known aortic stenosis since [**3290**]. She has experienced a slight increase in exertional dyspnea. She was recently assessed by an exercise tolerance test and echocardiogram which revealed more severe aortic stenosis. At times, the patient is aware of brief flutters which occur at night without lightheadedness, dizziness, presyncope or syncope. She denies effort related chest pain. She remains very active, and performs routine daily activities without difficulty. She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Month (only) 115**] for surgical discussion. She presents today for preadmission testing for an aortic valve replacement with possible ascending aorta replacement [**3295-8-29**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
71 yo M with h/o HL, HTN, CAD with IMI s/p 4v CABG ('[**11**]) presenting s/p cath with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension, low CI. Patient has long h/o CAD s/p IMI [**6-/2512**] with inferior fixed defect on stress test and akinesis at cath, s/p 4v CABG [**9-/2512**] with LIMA-> LAD, SVG -> OM -> Diag and SVG-RCA.  He has been off cardiovascular meds for > 5 years and has been lost to CV follow-up.  2 months ago, the patient first caught a cold with a sore throat, bad taste in back of throat,  and DOE.  No fevers, chills, CP.  Since then he has had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 681**] symptoms, and over the last 2-4 weeks, the patient was noticed to have decreased exercise tolerance due to increased DOE.  No sypmtoms at rest or to bathroom, but SOB climbing 15 steps. Also noted some increased abdominal distention, and wife noticed [**Name2 (NI) **] edema.  Symptoms have progressed subacutely causing the patient to present to the ED on [**1-20**] at [**Location (un) 614**] where BP was increased to 182/90, he had an elevated d-dimer (1.96 -high) and slightly elevated troponin x 3 (0.011-> 0.02 -> 0.016).  A CTA was negative for PE.  He was diuresed with lasix 20 mg IV x 2 with improvement in SOB and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath to evaluate for subendocardial NSTEMI.  At Cath, he was found to have CO 4.06, CI 1.91, RA 28/28/21, RV 67/26, PA 67/38/49, PCW 38/41/33.  Coronary angiography demonstrated LM - mild tapering, LAD proximal 90% then totally occluded, Lcx mid total occlusion after OM1 with distal reconstitution via collaterals, RCA proximal occlusion, and patent SVG-AM-RCA, Y-SVG-D1 and OM2, LIMA-LAD.  He was transferred post-cath to the CCU for diuresis. . ROS: No nausea, vomiting, + irregular BMs, no black or bloody stools, no weight loss, + decreased appetite at times, no night sweats. No PND, orthopnea
The patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with a history of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and left great toe surgery who presents with three days of left toe erythema and swelling as well as fevers up to 102 degrees Fahrenheit with rigors. Additionally, he has been having left hip pain as well where he had a total hip replacement before in the past and reports difficulty ambulating.  The patient reports no history of trauma, insect bites, or other exposures. Review of systems was essentially unremarkable with the exception of constipation times four days.
This 67 year old white male with a history of VSD repair in [**3400**] was admitted with a NSTEMI. About one week ago patient was out walking his dog at night and felt a pressure in the back of his head. It went away on its own after about one hour. Over the next week he had several of these episodes, always associated with walking. On the morning of admission he woke up with the pressure and it was much more severe, so he went to his doctor. His doctor thought he may have arthritis of his back and got a spine XR and prescribed Cyclobenzeprine. That night, however, the patient continued to have the headache and then had pain radiate down his L arm into his axilla. He went to [**Hospital1 5043**] where he had labs drawn that showed troponin of 5.34 and EKGs that reportedly had no changes from prior but with baseline RBBB. He was given ASA, Plavix, lovenox, beta blocker, vicodin, and a liter of NS and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath. On arrival to the ED his vitals were: T:97.7 HR: 100 BP: 123/65 RR: 16 o2sat 96% on 2liters. He received 1mg dilaudid X 2 and remained chest pain/head pain free.

Mr. [**Known patient firstname 9689**] [**Known patient lastname 9595**] is a 60-year-old gentleman with a history of severe end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy, status post coronary artery bypass grafting, status post biventricular pacemaker, on home milrinone who presents for tailored congestive heart failure therapy. In the Catheterization Laboratory, he had resting hemodynamics performed to assess response to escalating doses of inotropic afterload reduction.  His home milrinone was supposedly at a dose of 0.3 mcg/kg/min with a response to this in the Catheterization Laboratory with cardiac output and index of 3.91 and 2.37; respectively.  In the Catheterization Laboratory, he had a slight increase in cardiac output and index in response to increasing doses of milrinone; however, he had the most significant result with 0.9 mcg/kg/min of milrinone and 0.01 mcg/kg/min of Natrecor with a cardiac output and index of 5.32 and 3.23; respectively. He was subsequently transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further therapy.  At the time of admission to the Coronary Care Unit, he denied any chest pain or shortness of breath and actually admitted that he had no change in symptoms at home prior to admission.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9595**] is a 69 yo M with h/o chronic systolic CHF (EF 20%) [**3-8**] ischemic cardiomyopathy (severe 3VD), severe pulm HTN (on sildenafil and milrinone gtt), severe TR, and recurrent ascites [**3-8**] CHF requiring paracentesis q2 weeks who presents with weakness and muscle cramping x5-6 days. He is poor historian, most details of history come from ED report. Patient's symptoms started 5-6 days ago after his most recent paracentesis. Yesterday he accidentally took three times his usual dose of sildenafil (took 60mg). This morning he complained of orthostatic dizziness and nosebleed after getting up from a nap; otherwise in usual state of health. Wife checked his BP when he felt dizzy, was normal (118/50). Per his family, he has become slower to respond to questions, but has not seemed confused or disoriented. No increased/decreased fluid intake or changes in urine/stool output. He has also been having leg cramps (chronic, but worse than baseline). He has baseline nonproductive cough which has not worsened, no increased shortness of breath or leg swelling. His weight is currently down to 115 lbs (baseline 122, sinusoidal, varies by ~5kg based on volume removal with paracentesis); per wife he has gained 2.5 lbs over past day or so. . Per recent cardiology notes, patient has had progressively worsening hyponatremia over the past two weeks weeks in setting of his worsening end-stage CHF. On [**7-11**] sodium was 125, and on [**7-18**] sodium was 124. On [**7-18**] he had a 5L paracentesis. His wife has recently increased his Torsemide to 100mg daily (feels 80mg daily is "not enough"). . In the ED, initial vitals were: 97.4 109/63 74 18 100% RA. Pt [**Name (NI) 9701**]3 though slow to respond to questions. Exam notable for loud systolic murmur, JVD to mandible, ascites, no LE edema. Labs notable for Na 120, creatinine 2.4 (baseline 1.72-2.6 over past several weeks), glucose 255, Posm 289, BNP 3621 (has been as high as 3972 in past). CXR showed low lung volumes, head CT showed no acute intraparenchymal changes. Unable to obtain urine sample in ED. Patient was admitted to MICU for workup of hyponatremia. Vitals prior to transfer: . On arrival to MICU, vitals are: 98.0 103/75 86 18 100% RA. Patient AAOx3, slow to respond to questions (native language is Pakistani). He endorses hunger and thirst, also complains of BL leg pain. Repeat labs on arrival to MICU show Na 122, Posm 289, Uosm 279. . His sodium initially improved from 120->122->124 with fluid restriction alone, so in ICU he was restarted on home meds (Torsemide, Spironolactone, Milrinone) and home 1.5L fluid restriction and low-salt diet. After he was restarted on home regimen, his sodium again fell again, suggesting overdiuresis on home regimen and hypovolmeic hyponatremia. His toresmide dose was decreased from 100 to 80mg daily. . Patient was also noted to have 4/4 bottles growing GPCs thought to be due to his PICC line through which milrinone was administered and this was pulled. Patient had been receiving Vancomycin for treatment of line-associated bacteremia. . The patient denied shortness of breath, chest pain, and muscle cramping.  He was called out to the [**Hospital1 1498**] service given relative resolution of his hyponatremia. . On [**7-29**] at 1600 hours, CCU contact[**Name (NI) **] by [**Name (NI) 1498**] resident as patient was hypotensive to the 60's mmHg systolic.  Throughout the day SBP's had been in the 100-120mmHg range.  About 1500 hours, patient's milirnone gtt was stopped due to vancomycin administration.  Also given 2.5 mg lisinopril at that time.  An hour later noted to have hypotension in the 60's mmHg systolic. Bolused 250 cc NS.  Peripheral dopamine started and uptitrated to 15 mcg/kg/hr.  Family meeting at bedside reinforced DNR/DNI status with pt's wife [**Name (NI) 378**] as well as his two sons.  ICD turned off by cardiology fellow at the bedside given DNR/DNI status. Family requested pressor support, necessitating ICU transport for central line and arterial line.  BP prior to transport was 86/50. . In the CCU, patient is mentating well communicating in his language (Pakistani) with his family.  Tachycardic to 120's on dopamine gtt, SBP 90's/50's on NIBP.
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 3027**] is a 72-year-old woman who underwent a right nephrectomy several years ago for a right kidney cancer. Unfortunately she has recurred in that she has a large mass in the head of her pancreas which is a metastasis from the renal cell cancer. It has eroded through the duodenal wall and has been causing recalcitrant gastrointestinal bleeding necessitating continual transfusions of packed red blood cells. This is also disqualifying her from certain types of antitumor therapy. The patient is now admitted for resection of the lesion by Whipple pancreaticoduodenectomy.
81yo man with CAD, CRI, DM, hyperlipidemia and h/o NSVT s/p AICD placement initially presented on [**3413-7-27**] with four days of non-specific weakness, chills, fatigue without any localizing symptoms. He specifically denied any fever, headache, meningeal symptoms, dyspnea or cough. He denied any chest pain. He has no new abdominal complaints. He had no dysuria. He denies any new skin rashes or lesions. . He was found to have a RML infiltrate on AP chest film, and was started in the ED on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin.  As the suspicion for MRSA was low, and he has a history of penicillin allergy, this regimen was tapered down to monotherapy with levaquin. He initially was in no distress and saturating well on 2l nasal canula, but then decompensated on the floor: He developed acute onset of cough, dyspnea, and desaturated down to the 70's% and only returned to low 90's% on 100% non-rebreather. His ABG showed 7.32/44/66. He was treated with lasix 20mg IV, morphine 2mg IV, NTG, as well as albuterol nebulizer treatments. Stat EKG was unchanged, and stat chest film demonstrated again this infiltrate. . He was admitted to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and for consideration of non-invasive mask ventilation. He is DNR/DNI, but was willing to try non-invasive. . During his MICU course, he was continued on levaquin for empiric CAP coverage. Vancomycin was not started. His supplemental oxygen was weaned down to 2L nc. He had no further events. He had a swallowing study with no evidence of aspiration. He was cleared by PT to go home with VNA services. Urine Legionella Ag negative. Blood cultures pending.
This is a 77 year old female with a past medical history significant for atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft and hypertension, who presented to the Emergency Department with a one day history of acute onset of abdominal pain and nonbilious, nonbloody emesis.  The abdominal pain was sharp, localized to the epigastrium, and nonradiating.  The patient described some loose bowel movements throughout the day.  She denies any chills or fevers at home.  She denies any history of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use or peptic ulcer disease.  The patient denies any relationship of the pain to food intake. In the Emergency Department, the patient spiked a fever to 103 degrees Fahrenheit and the abdominal pain intensified and became generalized and constant.  She was evaluated by the Emergency Department physicians at which time a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained along with plain radiographs of the abdomen.  The plain radiographs of the abdomen were nondiagnostic.  The CT scan of the abdomen showed free air along the lateral border of the duodenum and in the mesentery of the right colon.  The right colon appeared very thickened with free fluid running down the right gutter into the pelvis.  A general surgery consultation was obtained.  Upon evaluation, the patient was found to have acute abdomen. The patient was taken to the operating room urgently after adequate resuscitation and the administration of intravenous antibiotics. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient had a fever of 103 degrees, tachycardia to the 120s, blood pressure 130/70, respiratory rate 20, and oxygen saturation 98%.  She was alert and oriented and conversant.  The lungs were clear bilaterally.  The heart was regular rate and rhythm.  The abdomen was rigid with rebound in all four quadrants.  She had active bowel sounds.  She was heme negative on rectal examination.  She had no cyanosis, clubbing or edema. LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, she had a white blood cell count 7.1, hematocrit 47.2, platelets 321,000.  The differential on the white count was 53% bands.  Her amylase was 138, lipase 346, ALT 28, AST 36, alkaline phosphatase 75, bilirubin 0.9. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1.  Digoxin. 2.  Lasix. 3.  Pravachol. 4.  Zestril. 5.  Atenolol. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the General Surgery service with urgent exploratory laparotomy.  The patient was found in the operating room to have a perforated second and third portion of the duodenum.  The right colon was thickened with abscess formation.  The patient underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.  In addition, the ulcer was treated with primary closure and placement of duodenoscopy tubes, gastrostomy, jejunostomy and cholecystostomy tube. The patient postoperatively was maintained on antibiotics including Ampicillin, Ceftriaxone, Flagyl and Fluconazole. She was maintained in the Intensive Care Unit throughout her hospitalization.  Her postoperative care was eventful for prolonged intubation, congestive heart failure needing to be maintained on Milrinone and atrial fibrillation. Her nutritional status was supported by TPN followed by slowly advanced enteral feedings to jejunostomy.  She was placed on Impact three quarter strength and slowly increased to her goal rate. In addition, around postoperative day six, she spiked a temperature which required further evaluation.  The evaluation included CT scan of the abdomen.  There was no evidence of abscess formation or leak on the CAT scan. However, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1642**]-[**Location (un) 1643**] amylase was sent which was as high as 77,000, consistent with a large pancreatic fistula.  The pancreatic fistula is being maintained and controlled with the [**Location (un) 1642**]-[**Location (un) 1643**] drains that were placed intraoperatively. Her atrial fibrillation was being maintained on Amiodarone drip and two attempts at electrical conversion. On postoperative day fourteen, she was extubated, however, maintained in the Intensive Care Unit for close observation for cardiac and respiratory issues.  She was weaned off the
79 yoF PMH CAD s/p CABG [**10/3272**] (SVG->LAD, SVG->OM, SVG->RCA), HTN, DM II, COPD, presented to an OSH ED after falling off of her chair at home.  Her husband called EMS and she complained of having chest pain for the prior four days, described as substernal chest pressure, rated [**7-5**]. She denied SOB, LH, or palpitation.  She did endorse some nausea and lower extremity edema recently. . At the OSH she wsa noted to have ST elevations in I and L and new Q waves in the same.  He Trop I was 10.6 (unknown lab standard) with normal CK-MB fraction.  Four hours later repeat Trop was 14.  She was given SL NTG for relief of her CP with intermittant success. . She was given ASA 325, plavix 400 mg times one, Integrellin 1 mg/kg, Heparin gtt, lipitor 80, lopressor 75 tid.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for cardiac catheterization. . On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for 4/10 chest pain on arrival which resolved spontaneously; she denies dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. She has some lt. ankle edema.
78 y/o male s/p Bentall w/mechanical aortic valve, CABG X 3 10 years ago.  Presented to outside hospital for routine INR check, wchich was elevated.  Pt. c/o SOB, CXR showed widened mediastinum. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive treatment.
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with restrictive lung disease and radiation fibrosis secondary to previous radiation therapy for Hodgkin's disease in the [**2648**] and recurrent episodes and admissions for aspiration pneumonia. She was most recently admitted to the Cardiothoracic Service on [**2681-3-11**], for recurrent aspiration pneumonia and hypercarbia and consideration of decortication surgery on her right lung. She had worsening shortness of breath, chest tightness, weakness fatigue, and mild cough on admission, which are typical symptoms of her exacerbations.  Her initial arterial blood gas was a pH of 7.24, pCO2 126, and her white count was 8.3 with 3% bands; however, she was afebrile with stable vitals signs and was initially with an oxygen saturation of 96% on 4 L supplemental oxygen.  She had no fever or chills at that time. She has chronic difficulty with clearing her secretions, and she was given suction treatment repeatedly on the CT Service through her tracheostomy which was placed last summer for suctioning and intermittent ventilatory support as needed. She had two bronchoscopies on [**3-11**] and 17 to clear secretions and evaluate her further.  The secretions were purulent with 4+ PNS and were positive on culture with MRSA and Enterobacter which was sensitive to Meropenem and Gentamicin. On the Cardiovascular Service, she became somnolescent on [**3-14**], and a repeat arterial blood gas revealed a pCO2 of 133.  She was seen by the Infectious Disease Service and started on Vancomycin 1 g per day and also Meropenem.  For ventilatory support, she was transferred to the MICU, where her arterial blood gas improved to a pH of 7.49 and pCO2 of 71. She tolerated a trach mask by [**3-15**] and was transferred back to Cardiovascular Surgery on [**3-17**]; however, after that, she became progressively short of breath with worsening cough and increased secretions which were yellowish.  She also became more confused, and her little pCO2 rose to 92, so she was transferred back to the MICU on [**3-21**] for additional ventilatory support. Although decortication procedure on the right lung, previously performed on the left in [**2681-6-26**], was considered, it was felt that the patient must first recover from this bout of aspiration pneumonia and be optimized in terms of her ventilatory support at a rehabilitation facility prior to this procedure.
The patient is a 54-year-old woman who developed Hodgkin's disease and was treated with mantle irradiation in [**2652**].  She did well with regard to her Hodgkin's disease but developed congestive heart failure and was found to have constrictive pericarditis and underwent a pericardectomy at the [**Hospital 9810**] Clinic in the early [**2668**]'s.  In [**2675**] she developed worsening shortness of breath and ultimately was admitted to the [**Hospital1 186**] in [**2680-4-26**] with respiratory distress and was found to have bilateral fibrothoraces.  On [**2680-6-30**], she underwent a left thoracotomy with decortication of the severe left fibrothorax with an excellent anatomic result.  Her postoperative course was complicated requiring tracheostomy and a feeding tube.  After being discharged to rehabilitation she suffered a respiratory arrest from a mucus plug and was resuscitated and transferred back.  Since that time she has had recurrent admissions for respiratory insufficiency requiring multiple bronchoscopies and an extensive workup. It appears clear that she has severe restrictive physiology resulting in severe respiratory insufficiency as a result of recurrent fibrothorax with a pleural RIND.  She also appears to have some trapped lung due to this fibrothorax which is resulting in chronic ventilatory dependence.  She is being admitted for right-sided decortication.
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with h/o HTN who came from [**Hospital 99**] Rehab with substernal chest pain after exercise. Pt had been in her usual state of health and performed here regular exercises. After returning to her room she w noted SSCP without radiation. No nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis. They did an ECG at [**Hospital 99**] rehab which demonstarted new ST depressions in V1-V4. She received ASA 81 mg x 2 and nitro SL x 2 with partial relief at nursing home. On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her vitals were HR 68, BP 142/68, RR 28, O2 sat 100% RA. Exam was notable for RRR with no murmur, bibasilar crackles, guaiac negative.

He was unable to answer other questions including a review of systems. Wife reports that patient has chronic cough productive of sputum.  She is not sure if this has increased recently. Review of systems: unable to perform given patient's mental status
The patient is an 84-year-old with a significant medical history, which includes multiple ICU admissions for UTIs that turn to sepsis who presented from his nursing facility today with altered mental status. According to my interview with the family, the nursing facility told them that on Monday he was drifting in and out of conversations and unable to articulate his needs in the usual fashion. He was also unable to feed himself because of tremors of his upper extremities. Though he had some improvement in his symtpoms today, they report that he was somewhat below his baseline throughout the day today. The patient denies any pain or complaints on review of systems, but family reports that he frequently downplays any symptoms. They report that he has had some cough and running nose, along with straining and apparent pain upon urination. The Emergency Department found: Of note, patient found to be hypernatremic over the last three days as high as 158. No hx per nursing facility. Exam: Uncooperative with CN examination. Spontaneously moves all four extremities but not able to follow commands well. Patient diabetic with altered MS. FS 115 on [**First Name3 (LF) 11275**]. No neurologic deficit on examination here. Lab evaluation shows elevated lactate, hemoconcentration. CXR shows pulm edema but no focal consolidation. VBG shows no CO2 retention. ProBNP better than previous admissions but still elevated. Urine was gross pus, UA sent which was pos for UTI. Started on vancomycin and cefepime after blood cultures, chose the abx based on past urine cultures. ARF: normal 1.5. Hypernatremia: given LR total 1L gently [**3-16**] hx of CHF and do not want to rapidly decreased. Free water deficit around 3.5L. CT scan of head negative for acute intracranial process.
87 y/o woman w/ h/oMI and CAD, presented on transfer from OSH after presenting there [**1-19**] with SOB, CHF, pulmonary edema. Diuresed well w/lasix, ruled out for MI. Had diagnostic cath at OSH revealing 3VD, 90%RCA, occluded LAD and PDA. Presented for repeat cath and likely intervention.
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 9778**] is a 60-year-old lady who in [**2531**] underwent an ascending aortic tube graft replacement for an ascending aortic aneurysm/dissection that was found to be circulytic in origin. That was done with a 24-mm Gelweave graft at the time. In [**2532**], she subsequently developed a pseudoaneurysm of the proximal suture line and was re-operated on and the pseudoaneurysm was resected and the anastomosis at that point was repaired. She has been experiencing worsening shortness of breath and was found to have severe aortic insufficiency with 4+ aortic insufficiency and a dilating left ventricle. The initial surgery mentioned the AV suspension of the aortic valve. She also had a right internal mammary artery graft at the time and underwent operation to the distal right coronary artery that was transected and revised at the time of the second operation. The preoperative catheterization and imaging showed that the right internal mammary artery crosses the midline and was in a very tenuous location.
This 71-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis and of coronary artery disease presents with a complaint of nausea.  She also had chest pain and shortness of breath.  She was previously admitted in [**Month (only) 115**] and [**Month (only) **] with aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease but declined surgery at that time.  Her catheterization of [**2764-6-4**], revealed an ejection fraction of 55%, anterolateral hypokinesis, apical hypokinesis, a proximal 70% right coronary artery lesion, a 30% left main lesion and her saphenous vein graft times two from [**2760**] were 100% occluded. The left internal mammary artery was patent to the distal left anterior descending artery.  She was status post coronary artery bypass graft times three in [**2760**].
The patient is a 64 year old female smoker with 1+ pack year smoking history, status post median sternotomy with intrapericardial left pneumonectomy and radical mediastinal lymph node dissection on [**2664-9-29**], for Stage IV, nonsmall cell lung carcinoma of the left upper lobe who was recently discharged from the [**Hospital6 1739**] on [**2664-10-5**].  The patient was readmitted complaining of anxiety and feeling short of breath since being at home and described noting chest pain in the inferior aspect of the rib cage bilaterally which served as an intermittent pain and became pain that was not tolerable even with pain medication at home.  At that time, the patient denies having any fevers or chills but has nausea without any vomiting.  Given this intense pain and nonresolving nausea, the patient was unable to eat while being at home.
[**Age over 90 **] yo F w/ h/o ischemic CM, EF40%, PAFm CAD, CRF (Cr 2.1) who was found down at home, minimally responsive and in resp failure. Per family, she c/o some nausea in AM and no other localizing sxs. She had progressively labored breathing throughout the day. Home health aid was concerned and contact[**Name (NI) **] PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1009**] recommended calling EMS. . On their arrival she was foud on the floor, struggling to breath. She was given lasix, NTG SL and was transported to [**Hospital1 18**]. In ED, she initially was on NRB w/ O2 sat of 96% but was intubated d/t work of breathing. BP 184/82, AFib at 114. . SBP was in 60s post-intubation and she received 1L NS and was started on Levophed. Also got CTX and Azithro. CXR showed question of RUL infiltrate vs asymmetric pulm edema. . ECG showed AFIB w/ RVR at 120s (old LBBB); neg CE's. Initial lactate was 4.8 and she was started on the MUST protocol for sepsis (MVo2 70).
HPI: [**Age over 90 **] yo female w/ [**Hospital 10093**] medical problems presents with hypercarbic resp failure requiring intubation in the ED. Pt presented w/ 3 day h/o SOB then acute worsening on day of admission. Unclear if she had any recent fevers. She did complain of a productive cough productive cough. Denied any orthopnea, PND. * Pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2678-11-19**] for Influenza A PNA and sepsis requiring intubation and pressors and complicated by malignant HTN, hyponatremia, CHF exacerbation. Also had amarosis fugax but with CT with no acute changes, felt to be high risk, but didn't start coumadin because of known history of falls. * In the ED [**1-12**], he went into hypercarbic respiratory failure and was intubated. Chest xray showed retrocardiac density, and so she was started on cefepime/ vancomycin for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia given recent hopitalization for Influenza. Started on dopamine for hypotension which was changed to levophed. Was extubated morning of [**1-14**] and ocntinued on levophed for support of hypotension. Transferred from [**Hospital Ward Name **] ICU to West ICU given bed availability.
95F with [**Hospital 10093**] medical problems including diastolic CHF (EF 55%), CAD, CRI, Afib who presented to ED in acute respiratory distress. The patient was recently hospitalized several times at [**Hospital1 2148**], including in [**2679-3-23**], during which time she underwent cardiac catheterization for CHF, s/p stent to 90% mid-LAD lesion. Most recently, pt was in hospital [**Date range (1) 10101**] for CHF exacerbation. Pt reports doing well at home since discharge but does report mild URI Symptoms (rhinorrhea and nonproductive cough) and some "sweats" during the past few nights (but no "sweats" during the day). . For the past 1-2 days, the pt missed all of her medications including lasix because her daughter, who keeps track of her medications, was out of town. Last night, the patient was breathing comfortably when she was going to bed but awoke at midnight with diaphoresis and shortness of breath which improved somewhat with albuterol and pt was able to fall back asleep. Pt then awoke numerous times throughout the night due to SOB and this progressed despite using albuterol MDIs so pt called EMS. . EMS noted BP 180/110, HR 104, RR 32, sat 94% on NRB. En route to ED, received 3 SL NTG and 80 IV lasix with minimal improvement and only diuresed 200 cc. In [**Name (NI) **], pt was unable to speak in full sentances. CXR confirmed increased perihilar haziness and interstitial prominence, bilateral effusions consistent with CHF but also with right lung haziness concerning for PNA. Pt was placed on nitro gtt, given 2 mg morphine, Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone for empiric coverage and placed on BIPAP. Pt felt symptomatically improved with BIPAP, then changed to 50% ventimask with sats low 90s, ABG 7.39/40/101. Pt then admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for further monitoring. . Upon arrival to [**Name (NI) 152**], pt reported feeling "much better" and her breathing was "almost normal." Pt denied F/C, diarrhea (is in fact constipated), CP, palpitations, orthopnea (sleeps on 2 pillows but prefers to sleep flat), PND, or increased LE edema. Denied dietary indiscretions. Denied DOE & is able to walk (w/walker) about her apt w/o stopping. . ICU course: ~ Respiratory distress thought to be multifactorial with pulmonary edema secondary to discontinuation of lasix being the main triggering factor. Other factors included COPD exacerbation in setting of volume overload and possible pneumonia.  Her pneumonia was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin which was later changed to levaquin/azithro.  She was started on solumedrol and standing nebulizers.  Pt had several episodes of respiratory distress, all of which improved with nebs and BiPAP. She was given prn Lasix with a goal of keeping patient one liter negative per day. ~ Her BP ran low thought to be due to poor forward flow but she was never on pressors. ~ Creatinine rose and urine output fell despite lasix.  Urine lytes revealed a FeNa of <1% indicating that pt's CHF was likely contributing to poor renal perfusion.  Further lasix doses were held given that pt appeared intravascularly dry. ~ Pt's hct remained low during her ICU but pt refused PRBC transfusion because of an episode of respiratory distress that the pt had after receiving a transfusion at [**Hospital1 2148**].
96F diastolic CHF (EF 55%), CAD, CRI, Afib who presented to ED in acute respiratory distress.  Most recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 2148**] for nausea/vomiting/dehydration, then received IVF putting patient into acute CHF, requiring intubation in [**Month (only) 541**] this year. <BR> Otherwise, USOH until this week, when she began to complain of some mild difficulty breathing.  Was felt by her PCP to have COPD exacerbation and increased baseline prednisone dose of 5QOD to 30mg QD two days prior to admission.  Seen by PCP at home who continued to feel this was "bronchitis" - unclear if [**Name (NI) **] prescribed at this point.  Did well through evening prior to admission (apparently prepared a meal for 5 people), then at 1AM on day of admission, began to have acute shortness of breath. Was given nebs and supplemental O2 by home health aide. <BR> After 1.5 hours, did not improve, and was brought by ambulance to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, found to have systolic BP in 230s, low grade temp 100.2.  Given Lasix, nitroglycerin, found to have ABG of 7.03/89/334 on BiPAP, and consequently was intubated (Etomidate/Rocuronium).  Nitro was initially to 333mcg at 0430, then downtitrated as SBP came down to 122-> was found to be agitated while intubated and given Versed 2mg-> subequently SBP down to 40/palp.  Started on Dopamine 20mcg/kg with improvement of BP to 97/44.  Given total of 5 liter NS. and urine output 930cc over ED stay.  Otherwise, given vanco/levo/flagyl, decadron 6.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname 7427**] is a 67 year old woman with known CAD who presented to [**Hospital3 10246**] Hospital on [**3426-7-18**] with worsening shortness of breath x 2 days. At time of presentation, her HR was 120, RR 30's, and BP 210/136. She had a CXR and elevated BNP of 660, felt to be consistent with congestive heart failure. She received Lasix 60 mg IV and was started on a nitroglycerin drip as well as NIPPV. Patient ruled in for an NSTEMI at OSH with troponin increase from 0.12 to 3.4. Cardiac cath was receommended at this time, but the patient refused. Patient agreed to a Myoview stress test, which demonstrated an apical myocardial defect with an EF of 28%. No c/o chest pain or dyspnea. Hospital course was complicated by UTI for which she has been treated with Levofloxacin since [**7-19**]. . In cath lab, all vein grafts from her CABG were down. Patient's left subclavian was occluded. LIMA was attempted to be reached via right brachial then right radial approach. 2 stents were deployed to right subclavian, proximal and distal. Catheter perforated branch of left radial artery. Heparin was stopped. While arm was being compressed, patient became bradycardic to 30's, BP unknown. CPR was initiated x 20 seconds. Atropine was given and heart rate to 150's. Hand Surgery was consulted for perforation of radial artery. . Pt was transfered to the floor on [**7-25**]. She underwent an additional cardiac cath on [**7-26**] with placement of 5 stents.

82yo F with PMH significant for CHF, CAD, type II DM, PVD, and CRI (Cr ranged from 1.4 to 3.3 in last 4 months) who presents with hypotension in setting of recurrent UTI. Pt first developed sx od dysuria 1 week ago and gave UA/urine cx to VNA for testing. Since then, has had persistent dysuria and her baseline incontinence, but no f/c/rigors/n/v/change in her back pain. This AM, her daughter noted that the patient was "breathing funny" while she was sleeping and when Ms. [**Known patient lastname 3094**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4991**], she felt she was breathing harder so she went to the ER. . Per the ER, the patient was sent there in f/u for a positive urine culture. On arrival to the ER, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 3094**] had a temp of 102, BP 122/80, HR 88. However, she quickly became hypotensive to 77/40. Labs revealed a lactate of 2.8 and code sepsis was initiated. She never had alteration in her mental status, tachycardia, or respiratory distress. She had a central line placed without incident and was given 1L of NS and 1u pRBC with improvement in her SBP to 90s. She was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for further management. . Of note, the ER resident considered further imaging of the patient's spine given her h/o of low back pain, recurrent UTIs and the question of epidural abscess raised during her last hospitalization earlier this month. She never obtained imaging as discussed at that time. On physical exam, the ER resident found decreased rectal tone, trace guaiac + stool, and saddle anesthesia. However, the patient is unable to fit in the MRI scanner on the [**Hospital Ward Name 511**], is claustrophobic, and has refused MRI in the past. A CT of the spine w/ contrast was not performed given her rising Cr (1.9). .

Ms. [**Known patient lastname 3094**] is an 85 year-old woman with a history of severe 2-vessel CAD, congestive heart failure and restrictive lung disease who presents with chest pain and shortness of breath. Initially presented to an OSH on the evening prior to transfer where she was noted to be short of breath with clear lungs. CK was checked and negative with a troponin of 0.14 and BNP of 246. Second troponin noted to be elevated (6.91) and her O2 sat decreased to 88% on RA. Lovenox and aspirin was given, along with IV diltiazem for a HR in the 120s. For possible COPD exacerbation, she was also given nebs and solumedrol. Upon presentation to our ED, vitals showed T 98.6, HR 90, BP 108/44, RR 20 and 88% on room air with increase to 94% on 3 liters. Plavix 600mg, lasix 40mg IV were given and she was taken to the cath lab. Review of systems: unable to obtain given intubation.
This is a 55 year old male with infarction times two, status post four vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2531-3-18**], hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and congestive heart failure, who reports he has had increased swelling of his abdomen and legs with swelling of the scrotum which has progressed over two to three weeks' time.  He also has had associated and frequent shortness of breath and inability to move. He was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] where he was admitted on the [**3-21**].  There, he was assumed to have biventricular failure as the cause of his edema.  He received Zaroxolyn and Bumex, but his BUN and creatinine elevated.  An abdominal ultrasound showed splenomegaly and a renal consult thought patient was pre-renal and therefore, the patient's diuresis was withheld except for Spironolactone.  ACE inhibitor was held as well. A cardiac ultrasound was attempted but the study was limited by obesity and Cardiology there recommended a MUGA Scan which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, good biventricular function. A paracentesis was done on [**1-23**], of two liters.  The studies showed 400 white blood cells, 520 red blood cells, no polys, 41 lymphocytes, 59 monocytes, glucose 126, total protein 3.9, LDH 110 and Enterococci grew out which was treated with Ampicillin one gram q. eight hours.  For a hematocrit of 25 he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells.  Repeat paracentesis on [**1-25**] drew off five liters; this was done only for the patient's comfort and no studies were sent. A BUN and creatinine on discharge were 127 and 3.8. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were 97.9 F.; 140/72; 56; 20; 97 on room air; 170 kilograms.  On examination, the patient was in no apparent distress.  Oropharynx clear. Mucous membranes were moist.  Heart showed regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1, S2.  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, distended with splenomegaly.  Extremities with two plus edema bilaterally. LABORATORY:  Chem 7 as follows:  137, 5.7, 102, 27, 127, 3.8, 153 glucose.  Calcium 8.9, iron 53, TIBC 298, hemoglobin A1C 7.3, TSH 17. Ascites with Enterococci sensitive to Ampicillin and sensitive to Vancomycin. HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 55 year old male with a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, significant coronary artery disease, but good ejection fraction on a recent MUGA scan, obesity, hypertension, and lower extremity edema with shortness of breath times two to three weeks.  He had his first paracentesis in an outside hospital recently with unclear etiology of his edema. A Cardiology consultation was obtained and a repeat echocardiogram was done to work-up the cause of his edema. This study was extremely limited and the left ventricular ejection fraction could not be estimated, but the systolic function  of  the left ventricle did not seem to be severely depressed. The right ventricle was not well seen.  Thickened aortic and mitral leaflets, and a right ventriculogram could be done if further quantification was to be done. In addition, the patient had an ultrasound of his right upper quadrant to determine whether flow was abnormal.  This showed a diffusely increased echogenicity in the liver consistent with fatty liver.  Portal venous flow with hepatopetal direction and a normal hepatic reflow.  The spleen was mildly enlarged.  There were mild ascites but no other abnormality on this ultrasound. The patient had paracentesis of five liters of fluid in-house which was clear and yellow.  The fluid showed 310 white blood cells, total protein of 3.2, albumin of 1.7, glucose 162, LDH 100, amylase 26, gram stain negative and a culture was pending. Hepatitis serologies were also sent to determine whether there was some evidence of liver dysfunction accounted by Hepatitis.  HIV negative, Hepatitis B surface antibody negative. The patient was maintained on a cardiac low-salt diet of less than 2 grams per day and diuretics were initially held secondary to the question of prerenal azotemia.  The Renal Service was consulted regarding this patient and acute renal failure was thought to be secondary to ACE inhibitors plus diuretics plus/minus infection, with the intention to restart Bumex 2 twice a day once the patient's creatinine reached its

60 yo male with extensive pmh including OSA requiring bipap, CHF (diastolic), HLD, HTN, CAD s/p LAD BMS and s/p LCx and RCA DES [**9-17**], atrial septal defect, mitral regurg, Tracheobronchomalacia s/p tracheobronchoplasty, hypothyroid, GERD/gastroparesis s/p Nissen '[**30**], anemia, DM 1 on insulin pump (which was stopped 2 days ago due to confusion), pulmonary edema, pleural effusion s/p talc pleurodesis, osteorthritis s/p R TKR on [**3231-10-28**], bipolar disorder and discharged on [**10-31**] to rehab who presents with AMS. He was discharge yesterday from ortho service to a rehab facility and was brought to the ED this AM for AMS, concern of right knee infection and hyperglycemia. . As per the discharge note, pt hospital course was complicated by AMS on post-op day #2 on [**10-30**]. His insulin pump was then stopped due to his inability to give bolus and he was placed on Lantus and slinding scale. His surgical wound on the right knee was noted to be clean and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage on [**10-30**]. . In the ED inital vitals were 98.4 92 114/84 18 100% 4L NC. His initial glucose was 538 w/ anion gap of 15 with a bicarb of 23 and K of 4.3. Urine had trace of ketone, he was given 10 u of R insulin and was given IV fluids (total of 4L). His physical exam was notable for confusion and agitation, and R knee tenderness erythema and edema. His Head CT showed no acute IC process and prominent ventricles. He had right knee xray which showed post-op changes, but no significant effusion. As per nursing report, pt developed a temperature of 102F.  He had blood and urine culture done and he was started on IV vanco. His glucose decreased to 300s and his anion gap closed. He was also very agitated requiring 2mg of Ativan and 5mg of Haldol IV. . On the floor, pt is calm and cooperative. He is A+O x place and person responding appropriately to question, but he has word finding difficulty. He c/o having increase cough and mild-mod pain on his right knee. . Review of systems: (+) Per HPI, + headaches (however he could not tell me for howlong of if this was a recent change), he denies having HA at this time. (-) Denies  chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin changes
The patient is an 83 year old female with a history of hypertension, breast cancer and colon cancer, who presented to the Emergency Department with a four hour history of substernal chest pain and was found to have anterior lead ST segment elevation and was seen by cardiology at which time ACS protocol was undertaken and the patient was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.  She was tried for a first period on the cool myocardial infarction protocol but this was aborted with the finding of a severe three vessel disease with an ejection fraction of 35 percent and cardiothoracic surgery service was consulted after placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump. Her cardiac catheterization showed that she had one plus mitral regurgitation with 35 percent left ventricular ejection fraction and severe inferior, anterolateral and apical hypokinesis.  The angiography showed distal tapering of 60 to 70 percent of left main coronary artery and proximal ulceration with 90 percent stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery and the left circumflex also had 90 percent ostial stenosis with 50 percent proximal stenosis of the right circumflex.  At the time, the patient was seen by the cardiac surgery service, she was afebrile and otherwise was hemodynamically stable.  She was on Integrilin. Her sclerae were anicteric and her conjunctivae were pink. The neck had no lymphadenopathy.  The lungs were clear bilaterally.  Otherwise, there was evidence of a radical mastectomy.  The patient's heart was regular without a rub or murmur.  Her extremities had no significant varicosities. The remainder of the examination was unobtainable secondary to the patient being draped during her cardiac catheterization.  Her preoperative hematocrit was 32.0 with blood urea nitrogen and creatinine of 20 and 0.8. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken urgently for a coronary artery bypass grafting times two on [**2799-6-4**].  She had saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending coronary artery bypass, saphenous vein graft to ramus bypass.  Her cardiopulmonary bypass time was 56 minutes with a cross clamp time of 41 minutes.  She was transferred to Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on Levophed, Aprotinin and Propofol drips.  The patient was initially unable to extubate secondary to apneic episodes but at the end of postoperative day number one, she was able to wean to extubation.  Her intra-aortic balloon pump was also discontinued at this time and her vasopressor drips were weaned.  By postoperative day three, the patient was off all her vasopressor drips.  She remained in the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit with some respiratory issues and was noted to have decrease in oxygen saturation over the course of postoperative days number four and five at which time a chest x-ray showed moderate left pleural effusion. She was being given Lasix but continued to have some respiratory issues secondary to the pleural effusion. Therefore, she underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2799-6-10**], to assess for any sort of bronchial plugging or lobar collapse. This showed a clear airway with only thin secretions.  Given the fact that her respiratory status continued to be her main issue, a left chest tube was placed at which time about 300 to 400 milliliters of serosanguinous fluid were removed.  The patient's respiratory status improved significantly after this.  She did have intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation postoperatively.  These were controlled with Amiodarone and beta blockade and she did convert spontaneously into a sinus rhythm.  Notably, the insertion of her chest tube was complicated by a pneumothorax but this improved gradually with suction.  Otherwise, the remainder of the patient's postoperative stay in the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit was essentially for her atrial fibrillation and maintenance of blood pressure which was somewhat labile given her conversion of rhythms and also secondary to some hypovolemia for which she was given fluid. By postoperative day number twelve, she was off all vasopressor drips, was in sinus rhythm, was maintaining a good blood pressure and it was felt that she was safe for transfer to the floor as she was hemodynamically stable and rehabilitation screen was started.  The remainder of her hospitalization was essentially remarkable only for an episode of bradycardia to the 40s and sinus bradycardia which was thought to be secondary to a combination of her dose of Amiodarone and Lopressor.  Her rate significantly improved into the 60s after her Amiodarone and beta blocker doses were adjusted.  Otherwise, there was no evidence of any ischemia

This is a 79 year old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate status post pharmacologic conversion and status post pacemaker for tachy-brady syndrome with congestive heart failure, diastolic dysfunction, and poorly controlled hypertension, who presented with shortness of breath.  The patient reports a three to four week history of "a cold" with cough productive of yellow thick sputum, occasionally blood. She admits to fevers, chills, which have been intermittent over the past few weeks but she did not take an actual temperature.  No night sweats.  She does admit to shortness of breath, especially with some severe spells over the last week.  This most recent one prompted an Emergency Room visit. She also notes decreased appetite, possibly change in weight, but her clothes are looser than they had been.  She reports good compliance with her home anti-hypertensives, but does not measure her blood pressures. She says her diabetes mellitus is borderline diabetes mellitus but not on any medications nor does she check fingersticks at home.  She denied any chest pain but was with tachycardia on arrival at the Emergency Room.  She received a dose of Lopressor and Diltiazem in the Emergency Room with good response.  Also, she received 20 of intravenous Lasix, Nitroglycerin, digoxin and then had a CT scan of her chest done to evaluate for shortness of breath.  She was noted to have some lymphadenopathy and diffuse nodules worse on the left than on the right.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3027**] is an 85 year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeds, known AVMs, and a complicated pulmonary history, which dates back to [**Month (only) 202**] when he developed a right upper lobe pneumonia and treated with Levofloxacin, complicated by right exudative peripneumonic effusion, which was treated with Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  In [**Month (only) 213**] a bronchoscopy revealed an apical right endobronchial lesion with biopsy and BAL negative for malignancy.  In [**Month (only) **] he developed alpha streptococcus pneumonia complicated by empyema and underwent decortication. He was initially treated with Ceftriaxone and Flagyl and then was changed to Penicillin G times two weeks and discharged to rehab.  A follow up bronchoscopy on [**1-20**] was unremarkable and showed no endobronchial lesion.  A few hours after the procedure the patient had desaturation to 75% on room air and was febrile to 101. The patient's gastrointestinal history includes prior gastrointestinal bleed times two presumed secondary to gastric AVMs seen on esophagogastroduodenoscopy in [**2552-1-8**].  He has had two colonoscopies one in [**2550-8-8**] revealing an adenomatous polyp and one in [**2551-9-8**], which was normal.  In the Emergency Room his chief complaint was decreased energy.  He also reported cough and dyspnea. He was found to be afebrile with stable blood pressure, however, his saturation was 68% on room air and came up to 97% on 6 liters.  He had course sounds bilaterally.  His arterial blood gases in the Emergency Room was 7.42/42/70/28 on 5 liters nasal cannula.  Chest x-ray revealed increased air space opacities in the right, mid and lower lung zones consistent with pneumonia, as well as a stable right pleural thickening/effusion.  A chest CT showed multiple prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, loculated pleural fluid on the right decreased in size from the previous study, new air space consolidation in the right upper middle and lower lobes and the left lower lobe.  He was started on Levofloxacin, Flagyl and Vancomycin.  In the Emergency Department it was also discovered that his hematocrit was 14.  He had a benign abdominal examination, dark brown guaiac positive stool. Nasogastric lavage revealed one small clot, positive bile, no blood or coffee grounds.  An abdominal CT showed infrarenal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 6.9 by 6.2 cm increased from 6.2 by 5.3 cm on a study in [**2550-2-7**], no retroperitoneal hemorrhage, extensive sigmoid diverticulosis. He was subsequently admitted to the MICU where he received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells and underwent endoscopy, which revealed gastric AVMs none of which were actively bleeding and some of which were cauterized.  In the unit he was also continued on triple antibiotics.  At the time of call out to the floor he was without coplaints, denied shortness of breath, chest pain or abdominal pain.
The patient is a 50 year old female with a history of breast cancer treated with surgery, high dose chemotherapy (including Adriamycin), auto bone marrow transplant and radiation, who has had other admissions since her treatment. The patient had been doing well up until approximately three weeks ago.  The patient developed a nonproductive cough, denied any fevers, chills, pleuritic chest pain and began to have episodes of shortness of breath. The patient now reports being short of breath at approximately angle of 20 degrees and could not lie flat at night.  No chest pain, no diaphoresis, occasional hot flashes, no nausea or vomiting.  The patient states that she has had weight loss over the past few weeks secondary to poor appetite, but denies any night sweats, and no hemoptysis.

The patient denies any history of tuberculosis or contacts with tuberculosis.
84M with stage 4 lung CA s/p 6 cycles carboplatin and pemetrexed (last treatment 8 weeks ago) p/w dyspnea at rest and b/l LE edema. He was in Poland for past 6 weeks and per family report began to accumulate edema and progressive DOE along with periodic low-grade fevers over past 3 weeks. He was transitioned from HCTZ to Lasix by a Polish doctor to address these symptoms. He returned to the USA on Sunday partially due to progression of these symptoms, and at that time his daughter (a physician) observed he had signficant dyspnea on minimal exertion (walking a few feet) and had pitting edema of the ankles. Since Sunday his symptoms have worsened, with dyspenia at rest and difficulty catching his breath as well as increased edema to the knees. He was already scheduled for a surveillance chest CT the day prior to admission. The chest CT performed [**3220-7-6**] revealed several new lung nodules as well as a moderate right pleural effusion. In the oncology clinic today, he was found to have a respiratory rate in the 40s with an O2 sat of 91%. His oncologist sent him to the emergency department for treatment of hypoxia and thoracentesis of the effusion. . In the ED, initial VS were: 99.2 82 148/86 32 100% NRB, 89% on RA. Patient was placed on bipap with improvement in symptoms. On transfer, VS were: 98.1 70 122/66 35 100 bipap. He complained of difficulty breathing and non-productive coughing, but denied chest pain/pressure, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, or any other pain. . He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] on NRB O2.  He had R thoracentesis with removal of 2 liters of exudative fluid.  Thoracentesis helped somewhat but still requiring oxygen and still tachypneic, though significantly improved.  He has been net negative >3.5 liters on his own since admission.Code status was changed to DNR/DNI in the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**].
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 13218**] is a 71 -year-old man with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, as well as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and previous peripheral vascular disease and transient ischemic attacks, who presented after a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with a complaint of unstable angina.  He was catheterized on [**3-28**].  This demonstrated a diffuse moderate hypokinesis of the left ventricle and an ejection fraction of 30% to 35%.  He also had mild mitral regurgitation at the mitral valve and 85% stenosis in the left circumflex, 80% stenosis in the left anterior descending, 90% stenosis in the diagonal, 80% stenosis in the right coronary artery, and 90% stenosis in the posterior left ventricular.
The patient is an 80 year old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hypercholesterolemia and a cerebrovascular accident in [**3274**], who presented to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3811**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] Emergency Room complaining of chest palpitations and was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory and subsequently found to have left main coronary disease which was stented.  Her course was complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring intubation, intra-aortic balloon pump and pressors. The patient was treated in the Intensive Care Unit for approximately two weeks, however, subsequently developed an enterococcal infection and became septic.  She developed renal failure and decreased urine output.  Ultimately, per discussion with the family, it was decided to withdraw support and make the patient comfort measures only.  The patient expired on [**3279-12-1**].

This is a 68 year old female with end-stage renal disease previously on hemodialysis with multiple access problems.  She was recently switched to peritoneal dialysis about three weeks ago.  She presents today with one day history of abdominal pain, fevers, chills and shaking, which all started last night.  Peritoneal dialysis went in last night without any difficulty; no nausea, vomiting, no change in her bowel symptoms.  The patient makes minimal urine at baseline.  The patient was complaining of aching abdominal pain which has subsided to some extent.  The patient denies chest pain or shortness of breath. In the Emergency Room, the patient was given her Dilaudid and was also given one gram of Ancef as empiric treatment for a question of an infected sacral decubitus.  There was an initial thought that the patient's symptoms represented bacterial peritonitis from the peritoneal dialysis catheter. Fluid was obtained and sent for cell counts and differential and culture to rule out bacterial peritonitis.  [**Known patient lastname 993**] blood cell count in the ascitic fluid was only 24.  At that time, no further work-up was done by the medical team for bacterial peritonitis.  It was felt that the leading diagnosis at the time was an infected draining purulent left buttock abscess. Meanwhile, while in the Emergency Room, the patient's blood pressure had dropped initially from 140/60 to the 80s systolic and at one point dropping to as low as 65 systolic while in the Emergency Room.  The patient received about two liters of fluid and received Vancomycin and Ceptaz intravenously.  It was noted that the patient's fever was down to 98.7 F., with improvement of the systolic blood pressure to the 130s.  A CT scan of the abdomen which was done in the Emergency Room showed a small decubitus abscess with extensive inflammation in the right buttock area. Surgery was consulted in the Emergency Room and drained abscess and packed it with sterile gauze. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.7 F.; heart rate 90; systolic blood pressure in the 130s over 60. HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Pupils equally round and reactive to light.  Mucous membranes were moist.  Neck was supple.  Lungs clear to auscultation anteriorly and laterally.  Heart examination: S1, S2, regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciated.  Abdominal examination showed normoactive bowel sounds, mild tenderness at the peritoneal dialysis catheter site.  No erythema.  The left buttock had a purulent and bloody drainage, a 1 cm lesion which probed down to at least 3 to 4 cm.  Extremities were status post amputation of the left index finger, the right third and fifth fingers, and a left below the knee amputation. LABORATORY:  On admission, [**Known patient lastname **] blood cell count 14,600, hematocrit 31.6, platelets 257,000, 90% neutrophils, zero bands, 5 lymphocytes.  PT was 22.9, PTT was 54.2; INR was 3.6.  Magnesium 1.7, phosphorus 6.2.  Lactate 3.9.  Sodium 138, potassium 6.8 which was hemolyzed.  Chloride 98, bicarbonate 26, BUN 47, creatinine 8.2.  Glucose 88, AST 59, ALT 18, alkaline phosphatase 74, total bilirubin 0.3, albumin 3.1, amylase 100, lipase 0.  Blood cultures and wound cultures were drawn in the Emergency Room. The ascites showed amylase of 4, [**Known patient lastname **] blood cell count of 24. Wound Gram stain showed two plus PMM, one plus Gram positive cocci in pairs. CT scan abdomen showed sacral decubitus abscess in the right buttock region and sacral region with a destructive lesion in the sacrum.  Question of chronic osteomyelitis.  There was no abscess present in the peritoneum. Chest x-ray showed increased pulmonary vascularity with blunting of the costophrenic angles with mild retrocardiac opacity.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11728**] is a 74 year old male with a history of HTN, DM2, ESRD on HD with atrophic L kidney, who presented to the ED on [**2562-9-20**] with a chief complaint of dyspnea on his way to hemodialysis.  The patient is a poor historian, and it is difficult to get a history from him even with an interpreter, however the following was obtained:  He had last received his regularly scheduled HD on [**2562-9-17**].  Patient denies any history of chest pain, palpitations, or change in diet (no high salt intake).  He does describe some nausea, emesis, and lack of apetite for the last few months.  About 1 week ago he noted increased peripheral edema, and on the night prior to admission he began having increased SOB.  He denies any fevers.  He describes a recent weight loss secondary to his nausea and decreased apetite, however he is uncertain of how much.  He may have had some mild abdominal pain, but this is only over the last few days. On presentation to the ED, he was afebrile, with bp 220/148, HR 103, RR 30s, saturating 94-97% on 100%NRB.  He was placed on BIPAP and NTG drip with good response:  RR decreased to 20s, BP decreased to 173/115, and the patient was transfered to the MICU for further management of what was felt to be most likely a CHF exacerbation based on physical exam findings of volume overload. No recent echo reports, however patient had a stress test in [**2554**] with 9.5 minutes of [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, no ischemia or EKG changes. The patient was transferred to the MICU for further management of his CHF exacerbation.  A CXR showed moderate CHF with small bilateral pleural effusions.  EKG was without ST,T wave changes. He received HD with good response - normalization of BP, IV nitro drip was weaned.  Received second HD [**9-21**] (day after admission to ICU), and was subsequently transferred to the floors.
75 y/o male with HTN, DM2, CAD s/p PCI to distal RCA with Cypher stent([**2563-7-26**]), ESRD on HD, presented for HD and had SSCP. In the ED, during procedure to place central line, he was put into trendelenburg and he became dyspneic, with desat and required intubation. He was dialyzed and became hypotensive, briefly required dopamine. Transferred to CCU for management of decompensated CHF.
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm.  He developed flutter, 4 to 5 out of 10 chest pain at 11:45 a.m. while working on a computer at home.  The pain radiates to left arm.  The patient took 2 nitroglycerin tablets and then another 2 without relief.  The patient then went to outside hospital. At outside hospital, EKG showed 2 to [**Street Address(2) 2023**] changes in the inferior leads.  The patient received Plavix, heparin, and nitroglycerin along with morphine and oxygen, and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for primary percutaneous coronary intervention.
This is a 64 year old gentleman who has a recent significant history for excision of malignant melanoma in [**3004-5-3**], with bilateral groin lymph node dissection with positive groin lymph nodes, had been recovering well until one week prior to admission when he developed increasing shortness of breath and decreased exercise tolerance, positive orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and left sided chest discomfort with exertion.  The patient presented to outside radiation technologist to receive radiation therapy to his groin, where upon discovery of symptoms, the patient was referred to the Emergency Department for further evaluation.
83 yo with h/o afib, gib, ischemic colitis, CHF just discharged from MICU to [**Hospital 99**] Rehab MACU on [**5-30**] readmitted with hypoxemiz and hypotension. This is the third admission this month for Ms. [**Known patient lastname **]. Please review past discharge summary for details, but briefly she had GI bleed from AVMs, dabigatran stopped, readmitted with ischemic colitis, managed conservatively. She was relatively hypotensive during her last admission. She was always very clear about her wishes to avoid invasive measures including central lines. At rehab, she was noted to be hypoxemic. CXR with e/o CHF. Started on lasix gtt. Difficulty with hypotension. Also had right calf pain and dvt ruled out by ultrasound. She was admitted here for work-up. In emergency department, was started on dopamine for hypotension. On arrival, discussed with patient and niece at bedside. She stated she wanted to be made comfortable. She stated that she did not want medicine to raise her blood pressure and was made CMO. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 120**] 7 from the MICU accompanied by her niece, and palliative care physicians (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from [**Hospital1 771**], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 11746**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 402**]) were consulted.  Per palliative care recommendations, was placed given intravenous and sublingual morphine, 5% lidocaine patch, acetaminophen, scopolamine patch and SL Levsin for comfort. Vital signs were held for comfort.  She was monitored regularly for pain and shortness of breath, which were treated with the above medications.  She was declared deceased at 13:47 on [**2796-6-5**]. Primary cause of death was CHF secondary to sepsis, with incident causes of GIB, mesenteric ischemia, ischemic colitis, CAD, atrial fibrillation, thyroid cancer.  Primary care physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11747**] was notified of admission.
[**Age over 90 **] YOF resident of [**Hospital 99**] rehab who presented to the ED with increased respiratory distress for the past several days. Pt is on standing ethacrynic acid tid for CHF, had recently started Levofloxacin and Tamiflu on [**3084-5-1**] for concern of pneumonia and possible flu. Additionally, pt had been asking staff at nursing home for increased doses of her pain medication (for OA) and of her Ativan.  Nursing staff there noted that she was increasingly lethargic, but that she was insistent that they give her the medications so that she could be comfortable. As had been increasingly sedated, she concurrently developed low grade fever and productive cough for 2 days. . In the ED, initial vitals were T 99.9 HR 81 BP 106/96 RR 24 98% on NRB. ABG showed hypercarbic respiratory failure with pH on 7.27 and pCO2 66. A central line was placed. She was placed on BiPAP with improvment of ABG to 7.31/56/61 on FiO2 40%.CT scan showed bilateral lower lobe opacities. She was given levofloxacin and Zosyn. She was transiently hypopensive to 70s systolic and was given a total of 3L of normal saline.
The patient is a 69-year-old female who presented on [**7-13**] with generalized abdominal pain of two weeks duration.  The pain was localized to the left lower quadrant and left upper quadrant.  The patient also had nausea and vomiting times one prior to admission, increased abdominal girth with increased shortness of breath.  The patient denied any fevers or any chills, any change in bowel movement.  The patient was initially seen and diagnosed with a diverticulitis.  A CT revealed possible perforation with abscess.  The patient was admitted to surgery initially and placed on NPO and antibiotic therapy.  The patient initially started on Ceftriaxone, Flagyl but when an IV was unable to be obtained the patient was switched to po antibiotics, this time on Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  These antibiotics were started on [**7-19**].  The patient subsequently developed worsening urine output and was transferred to the SICU for better fluid management.  A Swan Ganz catheter was floated in the SICU and patient received aggressive diuresis and aggressive fluid monitoring.  The patient recovered from symptoms of sepsis and a repeat abdominal CT revealed a decrease in the size of the abscess and a small fluid collection that was not deemed drainable.  The patient improved while in the SICU and was transferred out and then transferred to the Acove Medicine Service for further medical management and placement issues.
This is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, gastroesophageal reflux disease who is status post childhood head injury who presented to the Emergency Room with 12 hours of multiple episodes of projectile vomiting.  She is a resident of [**Hospital 2626**] Nursing Home and there at that facility was started on intravenous fluids.  A nasogastric tube was also placed which returned approximately 1500 cc of questionable bilious material with reported coffee grounds and was also reported heme positive.  In the Emergency Room, a KUB was done which showed air fluid levels and dilated small bowel loops consistent with a small bowel obstruction. She was admitted to the medical service, was made NPO, started on intravenous fluids and her nasogastric tube was kept to low wall suction.  Her nasogastric was putting out about 150 to 350 cc per day, however the patient continued to complain of diffuse abdominal pain with distention.  There was no report of flatus or bowel movements, although the patient was somewhat unreliable.  Due to the patient's failure to improve, a CT scan was obtained which showed dilated loops of small bowel with free fluid in the abdomen and the possibility of a closed loop obstruction.  A surgical consultation was called at that time and it was, upon review of the CT scan, thought that the patient had a complete small bowel obstruction.  She was then taken to the Operating Room for exploratory laparotomy.
This is a 49-year-old Caucasian male with a history of familial dysautonomia and metastatic lung cancer.  The patient presented to the Emergency Room following a brief syncopal episode that was preceded by acute shortness of breath.  The patient states that he had not had any pulmonary symptoms prior to [**3382-8-25**] when he developed acute shortness of breath, for which he was seen at [**Hospital3 **].  He was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion at that time.  A pleurocentesis yielded a malignant fluid that was later diagnosed as an adenocarcinoma.  A follow-up CT scan of the chest and abdomen revealed metastases to the liver.  The patient, at that time, was started on Taxol and carboplatin.  He received a second round of chemotherapy three days prior to this admission. The morning of admission, the patient states that he was in his usual state of health.  He went to dinner with his parents and shortly after, he started to complain of increasing shortness of breath that was not relieved by his home oxygen.  The mother reports that the patient started to hyperventilate and then briefly passed out.  There was no head trauma, seizure activity, bowel or bladder incontinence. The patient denies any chest pain, chest tightness.  He also denies any recent weight gain or increased swelling in the lower extremities.  He does report two-pillow orthopnea. Neither the mother nor the patient were really able to adequately describe the dyspnea.  They were not able to say whether it was an air hunger, or unable to catch his breath, or whether he was just unable to catch a deep breath.  Their only description was that the patient just had increased breathing efforts.
92F with h/o MGUS, CHF [**2-22**] severe MR/TR (EF >55%), afib not on coumadin, presents with fever and cough.  Patient is currently not conversant, therefore details of HPI are obtained from family.  Per her family, pt was in her USOH until a fall 4 days ago.  Fall was witnessed, no head trauma or LOC.  She appeared to be back at her baseline until the following morning when she developed fevers at home to 101.3 and cough x 2 days. She did not seek medical attention because she has preferred not to see a doctor for the past 2 years.  Family notes that she was generally at her baseline (AAOx3, playing cards), but was intermittently "out of it" for the past 2 days.  This AM she was more lethargic, and they persuaded her to go to the ED for evaluation. . In the ED, initial vitals were T 100.0, HR 101, BP 104/58, RR 16, O2 sat 94% 2L.  BP gradually decreased to 80s/50s and she became increasingly tachypneic, switched to NRB.  Received 1.5L NS in boluses, SBP increased to 90s.  CXR showed e/o LLL pna. She was given 2g IV cefepime and 500mg IV levofloxacin.  She was transferred to MICU for further management. . On arrival to MICU vitals were T 102.6, HR 93, BP 73/35, RR 26, O2 sat 100% on NRB.  Currently she appears awake but is not conversant. Family states that she was always very clear about her decision to be DNR/DNI and would not want aggressive interventions, including central lines or pressors. . ROS: Unable to obtain.  To family's knowledge, only notable as described in HPI.

65 yo M w/ PMH of CAD s/p anterior and inferior MI, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of 30% ([**12/3321**]), Atrial fibrillation (on dofetilide and coumadin), Ventricular tachycardia (s/p ICD placement with multiple ICD shocks), DM II who was admitted to the cath lab today for VT ablation.  Patient has a prolonged history of VT starting in [**3315**] with monomorphic VT and s/p ICD placement then. Since placement he has been shocked multiple times, once for atrial tachycardia and most recently in [**3-/3324**] for sustain monomorphic VT in the setting of grocery shopping and it was nonresponsive to antitachycardia pacing at 188.  He has since developed post-traumatic stress disorder due to the multiple shocks.  He has been previously treated for his afib with amiodarone however developed transaminitis and therefore was switched to dofetilide.  He was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient who recommended a trial of VT ablation in the cath lab. Today the patient underwent VT ablation with ablation around the inferior scar where he had 2 inducible pathways.  His course was complicated by poor LV function in the cath lab and required placement of an Impella. On arrival to the floor the patient had already had the Impella device removed.  He was alert and interactive, slightly confused.  He denied chest pain or difficulty breathing and reported that he would like to talk with his wife. On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Patient was admitted on [**3476-11-24**] with a chief complaint of recurrent right pleural effusions.  Patient is a 76-year-old female with polycystic liver disease status post two prior cyst excisions and one aspiration, who presented on [**11-4**] with a large right pleural effusion, plus herniation to the liver, and superior cyst into the right hemithorax with whiteout of the right chest and mediastinal shift.  An ultrasound guided pigtail catheter was inserted on [**11-5**] and effectively drained the effusion. She was discharged home in good condition on [**11-11**]. The day prior to admission she was seen in followup by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and repeat chest x-ray was found to have reaccumulation of her pleural effusion.  She presented on the date of admission for workup management per her primary care physician.
85 year-old man with a remote history of CVA minimally verbal with residual right-sided defects who presents with dyspnea and increasing falls.  Per his family he is generally unsteady on his feet but has been falling more recently.  He fell several times at home today, hitting his forehead and nose.  This morning, following the falls, he was not talking at all (usually communicates one word sentences and can yell for help).  His family called EMS.  Per their report, he has been complaining of foot pain, but denied shortness of breath or chest pain.  When EMS found him, he was in respiratory distress, with a low saturation (number no[**Serial Number 11891**]) on room air. Per his primary NP, he speaks in one word sentences at baseline. He recently has been seen for difficulty walking, possilby related to plantar fascitis and in the past two days has been looking somewhat pale.  On [**7-4**], he had a physical with labs: Hb/Hct 10.1/30.6 with MCV 87.9, B12 deficieny.  BUN/Cr was 58/2.1 In the ED, initial VS were: 95.6 72 140/49 32 96 on NRB.  He was tachypnic to 32, using accessory muscles.  An EKG was attempted, but was limited due to motion.  It was reviewed with cardiology, who recommended aspirin and blood given his elevated cardiac enzymes.  He was treated with 600 mg PR aspirin.  He was also noted to be in acute renal failure.  His chest x-ray was suggestive of a RUL PNA.  He was treated with continuius nebs, solumed 125, and mag 2g for h/o asthma.  He had blood cultures, levoquin and flagyl for possible aspiration pneumonia.  Given the right frontal head abrasion, he had a head/neck CT that was negative for acute bleed or fracure.  Prior to transfer, VS: HR 92 BP 145/52 18 100% on continuous neb @ 12 L FM.  His respiratory exam had improved from initially no air movement to increasing wheezing.  He got kayexalate for an elevated K and 500 cc IVF. . Currently, he appears more comfortable.
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 11911**] is a 68 year-old woman with end stage renal disease who has a failed kidney transplant. She had multiple procedures on her upper extremities and currently has a right sided PermaCath. There is a subclavian stenosis on the right side and so this side was not thought to be usable. Venogram on the left side  revealed 2 good quality veins. However, these were up at almost the level of the chest wall and given her previous grafts on the left side we felt that a high left upper extremity graft would be her best option. She understood the risks and benefits and wished to proceed.
History obtained from family, patient, and chart. 64 yo female with h/o ESRD on HD, DM and CHF who presented to the ED on [**3476-6-26**] with one day history of SOB.  The patient states that she began feeling ill two days prior to admission. She began to develop a non-productive cough.  She was staying with her daughter and had soup (broth-like) for dinner on Saturday.  Her daughter reports that she woke up at 2 AM on Sunday morning c/o of being hot, but did not take her temperature.  She woke up again at 4 AM c/o of being hot, and was confused and had difficulty finding her way to the bathroom. When she woke up on Sunday morning (day PTA), she continued to cough and was having "trouble breathing."  Her daughter reports that she had DOE on ADLs.  She also states that the patient looked puffy and had lower extremity edema.  She awoke on Monday morning at approximately 1 AM with increased dyspnea and was brought to the hospital by EMS.  On arrival in the ED she was somnolent, but arousable and able to follow commands.  She was hypertensive to 204/92 with a heart rate of 54.  She was afebrile at that time and had a cough productive of yellow sputum.  Her exam in the ED showed JVD, bibasilar crackles, but no lower extremity edema.  She was given nitroglycerin in the ED along with 60 mg IV lasix and was placed on CPAP. She was eventually transitioned to 100% NRB.  She was also started on Levaquin (750 mg IV). She was admitted to the MICU for dyspnea.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10846**] is a 61 year-old man with a PMH significant for HTN who presented to the ED on [**2823-10-19**] at 3AM complaining of progressively worse chest and abdominal pain for >1 day.  He was unable to give a complete history as he was in extreme pain and discomfort. He described having increased sensation of pressure on his sternum and he also had shortness of breath which was worse when sitting vs. standing. . In the ED Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10876**] initial vital signs were BP of 150-190/100-136, HR ranged 120-140, and RR=19-25.  IV nitroglycerin was started and the patient was ruled out for an aortic dissection with a CT torso.  The patient was in respiratory distress for presumed acute pulmonary edema as evidenced on CT. He was intubated for airway protection. An EKG showed rate 109, NSR, with a left axis deviation and ST elevations in V3 and V5. CK cardiac enzymes were flat.  He received ASA, eptifibitide drip, clopidogrel load of 600 mg, a heparin bolus and a code STEMI was called. . He was transferred emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab where he was found to have an occluded LAD distal to D1, into which a BMS was placed. He recieved 40mg of IV furosemide and started bicarbonate IVF at 125cc/hr. On CCU admission the team was unable to take a full ROS as the patient was intubated and sedated, however, the patient's last discharge summary indicated recent complaints of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and chronic lower back pain. .
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10846**] is a 61 year old male with past medical history munchhausens syndrome, anti-social behaviour, possible PTSD who frequently presents here to ED with hypotension and somnolence. In the past pt was discovered to have been hording his blood pressure medication (mainly clonidine) and taking it all at once. Pt also admitted in the past with eating his clonidine patch. In the past this had led to multiple ICU admissions, with ARF and most recently MI as a consequence. This time patient brought in to the hospital by EMS after being found poorly responsive. In the ED his initial vital signs were T 98, BP 120/60, HR 66, RR 8, O2sat 99%4L. 100 mg hydrocortisone, started on levophed for subsequent hypotension, kayexilate/insulin/glucose for hyperkalemia, renal consult for ARF, Vanc/zosyn for possible sepsis. Bedside FAST u/s was negative for bleeding. Narcane produced agitation and agressive bahaviour, pt started on empiric heparin drip for possible PE given history. ROS not obtained as pt barely arousable.

[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient states that he developed worsening bilateral LE edema over 3-5 days while at [**Hospital1 **]. He was progessively unable to walk due to pain in his legs. Endorses bilateral swelling of legs and hands, as well as some shortness of breath. He endorses stuttering intermittent episodes of chest pain which last a few minutes, resolve spontaneously, and can radiate under his left arm. He occasionally becomes diaphoretic after these episodes. No nausea. No fevers but occasional sweats as above. No vomiting of diarrhea. The patient states that he had a scan at [**Hospital **] Hospital which showed a clot in his legs. He was referred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED by his PCP for evaluation of edema, r/o DVT. In the ED, he was afebrile, BP: 130/90 P: 80s RR: 16 Sat: 97-100%RA. On exam, no crackles, but wheezing diffusely. + LE edema in both legs, appears red but not felt to be cellulitic. Labs revealed mildly elevated potassium and proBNP 2479. CEs were negative x 2. EKG showeed old anteroseptal MI but no acute ischemic changes. CXR without overt CHF but + mild vascular congestion. Bilateral LE U/S were negative for DVT. He received kayexalate, ASA, and 20mg IV lasix, admitted for CHF exacerbation.
A 61 year old gentleman was seen in the ED with after reporting he was having lower extremity swelling, dizziness, and falling down. He feels this was related to an atenolol allergy. In the ED, his vitals were T 100.8, BP 135/72, HR 45, and 94% on RA. He was given lasix 20 mg and aspirin in the ED. He additionally complained of chest pain, dyspnea and diaphoresis though he was unreliable in the ED. Per there report, he was responsive to sternal rub and answered limited questions for them. He reports that he was given a prescription for atenolol at [**Hospital1 2148**] but has a history of atenolol allergy. . In the ED, VS: 100.8 135/72 45 16 94%RA.

On the floor, patient is stable in mild distress. . Review of systems: (+) Per HPI
The pt. is a 65 year-old female with metastatic hepatoma who initially presented to clinic complaining of increased abdominal girth, lower extremity edema and shortness of breath. She has been non-compliant with diuretic therapy and only recently restarted Lasix 20 mg daily.  Over the last month PTA, the pt. has noticed significant increase in her abdominal girth as well as her pedal edema. Her appetite has been poor over this time period.  She also noted increasing shortness of breath and an inability to ambulate more than a few feet secondary to lower extremity edema and shortness of breath. She was seen in clinic one week PTA at which time the dosages of diuretics were increased; she refused a paracentesis.  Despite the increased dose of lasix and aldactone, the pt. has experienced volume overload.  She was admitted for further diuresis and a therapeutic paracentesis. On review of systems, the pt. denied recent fever, chills, cough, chest pressure, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, arthralgias or myalgias.  She has noticed recent loss of appetite, shortness of breath, and chronic right chest wall pain. Oncologic Hx: The pt. contracted hepatitis C due to a blood transfusion approximately 15 years ago in [**Country 11011**]. She underwent radiofrequency ablation of hepatomas in 8/[**2550**].  She was initially treated with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and gemcitabine from [**4-4**] to [**10-5**] but failed treatment on this protocol as evidenced by rising AFP and worsening physical exam findings. She underwent radiation to painful rib lesions in [**10-5**]. She was then treated with Xeloda in [**11-4**].  She has been most recently treated with weekly 5-FU and leucovorin in [**2-3**]. Her last dose was on [**2553-2-15**] and it has been held since then due to thrombocytopenia and fatigue. * She was transferred to the MICU for the development of hypotension to 60/40 -BP on admission = 122/80, and increasing O2 requirment on with gas = O2= 86 CO2 = 35 pH = 7.36 on 12 L NRB. The patient underwent a diagnostic tap and then received dopamine to maintain her BPs.
Patient reports that she first experienced pain in her left shoulder and radiating down her left arm yesterday morning.  She was not exerting herself, not eating, she was playing cards which she usually does most mornings before breakfast.  The pain was very difficult to describe, not sharp or dull per se, she thought it was her arthritis.  Lasted about 10 minutes and spontaneously resolved without interventions.  Then this morning she had another episode of similar left shoulder pain this am, lasting a little longer, maybe about 1-2 hours.  She denies having shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis with these episodes.  With the pain this am she had a second of lightheadedness and that is why she decided to come in to the hospital for it. In the ED, initial vitals were 97.2 88 122/62 16 99% 2L NC. Labs and imaging significant for troponin of 0.25 with normal renal function and EKG with ST elevations in aVR and lead III > II as well as depressions in I, II, V4-V6.  Otherwise NA/NI, rate 80s, + LVH and LAE. Patient given heparin gtt, morphine, and NTG in the ED then  taken immediately by cardiology to the cath lab.  In the lab, she had totally occluded RCA, which was old from [**3157**] and previous stent to LAD was patent.   Occluded OM off a tortuous circ.  DES to circ to obstuse marginal. Angioplasty to native circumflex. Perclose. . On arrival to the floor, patient is feeling well, no more pain in the left shoulder.  She does not have any complaints.  She does report history of caludication symptoms in the past and some chronic shortness of breath, not exertional.  Denies PND. . REVIEW OF SYSTEMS On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She reports exertional calf pain.  All of the other review of systems were negative. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.
82M with PMH of dementia, DM2, CRI (baseline Cr 1.6), cCHF and episode of cholangitis in [**2984-3-2**] requiring ERCP with spincterotomy and stent placement, presented to OSH with chills and weakness, found to be hypotensive.  In [**Month (only) **], patient presented to OSH with sharp RUQ pain, fever, found to have cholecystitis secondary to choledocholithiasis.  An ERCP was performed, but not all the stones could be removed, so a stent was placed to facilitate continued drainage and a sphincterotomy was performed.  During the same hospitalization, he also had a CCY.  Patient was instructed to f/u for stent removal in 1 month, but was lost to f/u.  Since then, patient has had off/on fevers over last few months, and in [**Month (only) 202**], was admitted for FUO, thought to be due to cellulitis because they could not find another source (but now, in retrospect, thought to be biliary). On the day prior to transfer, patient presented to OSH with intermittent fever, chills, weakness and RUQ pain.  He had AMS (although he has baseline dementia, so unclear how different MS was from baseline), T101, WBC 30, elevated Tbili 1.7.  CT abd showed "stent in good place."  He was found to be hypotensive to sbp 80s, but was responsive to fluids (was given 1L NS bolus and then 2L NS at maintenance rate), was able to maintain SBP>100. Patient never required pressors.  Due to his septic picture, he was started empirically on Linezolid/Zosyn. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] in case he crashes overnight and needs emergent ERCP in the ICU, which couldn't be done in [**Location (un) **]. Of note, patient has baseline dementia and confusion, but is not agitated, and is oriented x self, place. . On transfer, his labs showed: WBC 31.8 (24% bands), hct 40.5, plt 126. He has been afebrile.  Na 137, K3.5, Cl 101, Hco3 21, BUN 29, Cr 1.9 (baseline 1.6).  Latest ABG: 7.37/39/65, satting 95%(2L). Blood cx from [**9-25**] are pending, UA negative, CXR clear.  Abd CT with perinephric stranding (old), biliary stent in place (same stent as placed in [**Month (only) **]) - concering for stent blocked.  TB 3.0 now, ALKP 200, ALT 94. Prior to transfer, [**9-26**] blood culture returned positive for aerobic GNR in varying sizes, GPC in chains and pairs.  An anaerobic bottle grew GNR, GPR, and rare GPC in pairs. . On arrival to the ICU, patient's vitals were:  T99.5 HR83 BP102/49 RR26 O2sat 99(3L).  Patient is comfortable, complains of thirst, fatigue, and headache.  Very somnolent, but conversant and responds appropriately to questions, although does not provide many details.  Denies abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, fevers, chills.
History obtained from EMS and relatives as pt mute.  79 yo man w/ PMHx sig for multiple strokes, HTN, DM who presents as a code stroke.  The AM of admission, the patient was seen by his niece, who serves as his caregiver, to be talking and complaining of drooling out the side of the mouth.  This occurred at ~ 10am. He progressively had difficulty communicating and by the time he reached the ED room at 11am he was mute.  EMS called ED to alert possibility of code stroke en route.
The patient is an 82-year-old male who was in his usual state of health until the day of admission when he developed sudden onset of shortness of breath while gardening.  The patient took two sublingual nitroglycerin which provided him no relief and he called EMS. In the field, the patient was found to be tachypneic with saturations in the mid 80s and a blood pressure initially of 250/palpation.  The patient was intubated in the field for respiratory distress.  He received Lasix 80, aspirin and nitroglycerin in the field.  On arrival to the Emergency Department, he received fentanyl, Versed and patient's blood pressure dropped to 53/27.  He was started on peripheral dopamine.  Following that, his blood pressure then bounced up to 170s/60s and the dopamine was discontinued.  The patient also received 80 more of intravenous Lasix in the Emergency Department.  He put out about 500 cc with a total of 160 mg of intravenous Lasix.  Per report, the patient denied any chest pain, palpitations, fevers or chills prior to the development of shortness of breath.
The patient is an 82-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease with unrevascularized three-vessel disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20% with also a history of VTs and sinus node dysfunction and status post VT ablation and pacer ICD placement, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, who was admitted with acute onset of substernal chest pain for one hour while at rest.  The patient reported associated symptoms of diaphoresis and shortness of breath.  The patient took six sublingual nitroglycerins without relief and he was given Lasix 80 mg IV en route to the Emergency Department.  The patient refused aspirin. In the emergency room his heart rate was 96, blood pressure 194/88 and his oxygen saturation was 86% on a face mask, which improved to 95% on BiPAP.  Chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure and the EKG was uninterpretable due to pacer.  He was given aspirin, nitroglycerin and was transferred to the coronary care unit where aggressive diuresis was initiated for his congestive heart failure. During his diuresis, he developed some abdominal pains and laboratory studies showed an elevated amylase and lipase. The patient is a poor historian, but reported vague abdominal pain approximately two weeks ago when he went for a pacer check with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient in the coronary care unit was given some gentle hydration in response to his acute pancreatitis, and the patient was transferred to the floor where his pancreatic enzymes were trending down, however he developed a leukocytosis and a temperature to 101.1.  On the floor he was taking clear liquids without abdominal pain.  He denied any back or epigastric pain, but again the patient is a very poor historian.
This is an 82 year-old male with an extensive past medical history including severe coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure with a known EF of 20% who was in his usual state of health until the afternoon on admission around 5:00 p.m. after pulling on his grill on his barbecue he had significant exertion.  The patient developed acute pallor, vague chest pain radiating across his shoulders.  Symptoms persisted and his wife called 911.  In the ambulance the patient became acutely short of breath and the was noted to be hypertensive to 170/100.  On arrival the patient's blood pressure was 187/87 with a heart rate of 94, oxygen sat 96% to 100% nonrebreather.  The patient was noted to have rales to the apices and chest x-ray consistent with severe pulmonary edema.  The patient was subsequently sedated and intubated with subsequent decrease in his blood pressure requiring intravenous Dopamine.  His blood pressure slowly improved on Dopamine and it was weaned and intravenous nitro and Lasix was administered.  Of note the patient complained of severe abdominal pain.  A KUB was unremarkable.  CT scan was not done during this examination given the improvement of his abdominal pain over the course of his admission.  The patient was transferred to Coronary Care Unit for further management and workup of his congestive heart failure and abdominal pain.
The patient is an 82-year-old Italian gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease and 3-vessel disease by cardiac catheterization, and congestive heart failure with systolic and diastolic dysfunction (last ejection fraction 20% in [**3052-5-23**]) who had a recent Coronary Care Unit admission from [**8-30**] through [**3052-9-8**] for a congestive heart failure exacerbation requiring intubation.  This hospital stay was complicated by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and bacteremia, and the patient was discharged to rehabilitation with six weeks of vancomycin treatment. The patient presents today with diaphoresis and weakness with shortness of breath.  He denies chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or palpitations.  He was brought to the Emergency Department from his rehabilitation facility. As mentioned above, on his last admission the patient had flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation and pressors with a difficult extubation secondary to aspiration.  The patient was found to have methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in his sputum and blood and was treated with vancomycin for a 6-week course.
Mr [**Known patient lastname 11061**] is an 85 yo male, h/o CHF with BiV pacer, CAD, COPD/restrictive lung disease, CRI who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**3054-12-25**] with 1 week of fever, chills, sweats, productive cough, that worsened further with intractable nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. He denied CP, pleuritic CP, LE edema or SOB. He had spent the previous 2 weeks visiting his wife daily at [**Hospital1 18**] and then her rehab center. In the ED, he was found to be mildly febrile to 100.6, saturating adequately on room air. KUB showed non-specific bowel gas pattern but no evidence of obstruction. CXR showed mild bilateral pleural effusions with patchy LLL consolidation, c/w infiltrate. He was admitted to medicine for treatment of pna and further care.
88yo F w/ h/o HTN, lower extremity edema and afib on coumadin was brought in by family for concern of lethargy and found to be hyponatremic to 106. Pt had an unwitnessed fall on Friday ([**7-22**]) but denies head strike or LOC. She briefly c/o posterior right shoulder which resolved shortly afterwards. Family noticed that pt had increasing fatigue and mild intermittent confusion over the past week. Her son said that on Wednesday they were able to complete a 2 block walk, longer than her usual walks, and did not experience SOB but felt fatigued afterwards. Pt has not had fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, dysuria, abdominal pain or bowel changes. However, family noted decreased appetite, po intake and urine output during this time. Pt lives alone and according to her son is normally quite functional and independently prepares her own food, reliably takes her medications and walks stably with a cane. Pt had complained of increased lower extremity edema during this time and in an effort to decrease edema pt reportedly decreased her fluid intake. When son stayed with his mother over the weekend and noticed decreased uop, the family recommended that she drink free water. Per family report she continued to take her prescibed doses of her medications, including anti-htn meds HCTZ, diovan and felodipine. Pt has had chronic lower extremity edema worsening over the past month and was evaluated by PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**6-24**] and [**7-5**]. On both visits pt was found to have 3+ pitting edema in lower extremities with clear lungs and non-elevated JVP, not clinically determined to by volume overloaded. On [**6-24**] pt was found to be hyponatremic to 128 (baseline Na 134-138 over past year). PCP recommended compression stockings which she has not been compliant with, and discontinuation of felodipine however pt was hesitant to do so since she felt the CCB was improving her bp. Also of note, on [**6-24**], pt's weight was 131.5lbs (59 kilos) and had elevated INR of 4.7 (previously within [**12-24**] INR goal, on [**2-7**] INR 2.4). Last echo (stress) [**4-28**]: normal LVEF >55%, no wall motion abnormalities, no evidence of inducible ischemia, poor functional exercise capacity. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation at rest. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension. In the ED, initial VS were: 97.9 HR: 60 BP: 143/68 Resp: 22 SaO2Sat: 100. Labs notable for Na 106, K 2.9, Cl 73, Ca 7.9, Phos 1.3, Mg 1.8. CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary edema and possible right lower lobe atelectasis. Pt was started on empiric antibiotic coverage with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Pt was started on NS at 100cc/hr. On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were 97.8, hr 64, bp 147/78, rr 19, Sa02 93% on RA. Repeat labs after pt received ~150cc NS showed Na 106, K 3.1. Pt was continued on NS at 100cc/hr and electrolyes repleted with Mg sulfate, K phos and Ca gluconate. After ~500cc NS repeat Na was still 106. After ~666cc NS repeat Na was 107 and Ca 8.2, Phos 2.8, Mg 2.5. Renal was consulted regarding starting hypertonic 3%NS. Review of systems: (+) Per HPI.

Ms [**Known patient lastname 9805**] is a 50 year old woman status post recent decortication of left fibrothorax, complicated by respiratory insufficiency.  She is tracheostomy-dependent.  Ms [**Known patient lastname 9805**] was found on [**2680-8-2**] in respiratory and cardiac arrest.  She converted to a sinus rhythm spontaneously after cardiopulmonary resuscitation and suction at the rehabilitation facility. She vomited twice during this event and has had an elevated white blood cell count and temperature.  She has a possible history of aspiration.  Following this arrest event Ms [**Known patient lastname 9805**] was transferred to [**Hospital6 1991**].

The patient is a 53 year old woman transferred to the [**Hospital6 253**] from the [**Hospital6 **] following an Intensive Care Unit admission for cardiopulmonary arrest at home.  The patient was reported to have had increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion for two days prior to [**2680-10-25**] when she was found down on the ground at home.  911 was called and the patient later shocked back to a normal sinus rhythm from asystole documented on an automated external defibrillator.  She was also intubated in the field. Her transfer to the [**Hospital6 253**] from the [**Hospital6 **] was delayed by some difficulties in transferring her because of her ventilator dependence.  The patient has a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma status post mantle radiation in the 70s complicated by radiation pulmonary fibrosis.  The patient also developed some constrictive pericarditis that required a pericardial window in the 80s.  The patient has a history of progressive dyspnea on exertion over the past five years with oxygen dependence over the past two years.  She also has recurrent congestive heart failure.  During the spring of [**2680**], the patient presented with increasing shortness of breath and severe orthopnea which was later found to be secondary to fibrotic entrapment of her left lung.  The patient later underwent decortication of her left lung in [**2680-6-26**].  She was later discharged to a rehabilitation facility where she suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest later in [**2680-6-26**].  The patient was resuscitated and transferred to the [**Hospital6 1739**] where she recovered after a period in the Intensive Care Unit.  She has since then had recurrent problems with aspiration pneumonia.  She was ultimately discharged home.  She appeared to be doing well until the current episode of cardiopulmonary arrest.
This is a 57 year old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, now on Coumadin, initially on [**2998-5-31**], to the Emergency Department, status post mechanical fall.  Apparently while standing up from toilet, she had lost her balance and fell on right knee and hip.  She denies syncopal or preceding symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or lightheadedness.  No head trauma and no loss of consciousness.  She was unable to get up on her own and called the ambulance.  In the Emergency Department, the patient received Percocet and Toradol for right knee and hip pain and then subsequently had right hip and knee plain films which were negative for any acute fractures.  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 510**] Medicine for presumed pain control, but was subsequently found to have a hematocrit of 23.0 from baseline of 31.7 on [**2998-5-24**].  She was subsequently found to be supratherapeutic on her Coumadin with INR of 6.8.  Given her concern for trauma to her right hip and potential of bleeding, she was sent to CT which subsequently showed a large retroperitoneal hematoma 7.8 by 6.0 centimeters extending along the base of her psoas muscle into her inguinal canal.  The patient was given subcutaneous Vitamin K, two units fresh frozen plasma and seven unit of packed red blood cells ordered.  Meanwhile, the patient had pulled out peripheral access from the Emergency Department and underwent a successful right internal jugular placement via ultrasound guidance.  Surgery was also consulted and the patient was sent to the Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation.  At the time of transfer, the patient complains of right hip/back pain but otherwise is asymptomatic in terms of being lightheaded, shortness of breath or chest pain.
[**Age over 90 **]yo M with h/o CAD, CHF, presenting from [**Hospital3 10179**] hospital with possible periorbital cellulitis with question of intracranial spread. . Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11144**] first presented to OSH with L nasal and periorbital swelling over the 2-3 days prior to admission. His son also notes that he has had some confusion over the last week, which is atypical. He denies any recent trauma, denies F/C/NS, headaches, dizziness, CP or SOB. His son does note decreased appetite over the last few months, with 20lb weight loss, and has started Ensure supplements. A CT was done, which demonstrated a 2cm x 1.5cm mass or area of infection. Concerning was the radiologist's read of air in the orbit, cavernous sinus, and L jugular. AP CXR done, which was reportedly unremarkable. He was also noted to be in AF (unclear chronicity - pt and son unaware of AF diagnosis). He was started on meropenem, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for neurosurgical evaluation. . In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were T: 97.4F, BP: 116/79, HR: 122, RR: 25, SaO2: 98% RA. On exam he was noted to have erythema and nasal swelling and fluctuance along the L nasal bridge. He was given a dose of vancomycin, and, on the recommendation of neurosurgery, sent for a repeat head CTA. The CT demonstrated a peripherally enhancing 2.1cm x 1.4cm soft tissue mass, which could be neoplastic, infectious, or both. There were clear paranasal sinuses, no erosion of the nasal bone, and no evidence of intracranial involvement. Also seen were small air bubbles of unclear etiology, in the right orbit, bilateral IJs, adjacent to the R IJ at level of clavicle, R cavernous sinus, and in subcutaneous tissues posterior to the left orbital well. While in the ED, he was also noted to be in AF with RVR to 140s, remained hemodynamically stable, and received diltiazem 15mg IV, which lowered HR to 90s. . After reaching the floor, NF resident attempted needle aspiration - obtained tiny amount thick, purulent fluid in needle, but insufficient to send to lab.  Plastics was consulted, I and D was performed and [**3-6**] swab from the wound grew coag negative staph.  Dermatology biopsied lesion and pathology is still pending. . On [**2695-3-7**] patient experienced increasing respiratory distress in the setting of known CM w/ EF <20%, and was receiving IVFs for contrast induced nephropathy (ARF post CT w/ contrast), and a. fib w/ RVR.  He was transferred to the CCU for further management.  Lasix drip was started as was digoxin with good effect.  He was transferred back to the floor on [**2695-3-10**] off lasix drip and maintaining O2 sats on room air.

The pt has a history of recalcitrant NYHA stage 4 CHF with numerous protracted previous hospital courses requiring lasix drips, nesiritide and intubations.  He currently has [**1-11**] pillow orthopnea, denies CP or anginal equivalents, and notes indolent bilateral lower extremity swelling.
63 y/o F w/COPD, OSA, RSD, GERD, who presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital tonight c/o dyspnea.  Per their notes, she had four days of increasing shortness of breath, "raspy breathing", and leg edema.  Pt nods her head yes when asked if she has increasing swelling in her legs and difficulty breathing when lying flat, says no when asked about cough.  En route to their hospital she developed 8/10 chest pain.  On arrival, she was tachycardic in the 100s, hypertensive to the 140s/60s, saturating 91% on a NRB.  She was given nitro paste and lasix 60 mg IV.  She continued to have chest and abd pain, and was given morphine 10 mg IV and pepcid 20 mg IV.  She also received compazine 10 mg, levofloxacin 500 mg IV, and solumedrol 125 mg IV.  She put out 1600 cc to the lasix.  Her ABG was 7.41/48/55 and it was decided to transfer her to [**Hospital1 **] for further care. . In our ED, her vitals were 103.4, 109, 110/70 (ranging 100s-170s/50s-70s).  RR initially 19 with O2 sat 88% on NRB. She was emergently intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Her ABG here (per ED resident was a preintubation ABG but was after she had been intubated x 5 minutes?) 7.38/56/77 (so was on either 100% NRB vs intubated with 100% FiO2).  She was given an additional 250 mg levofloxacin, as well as etomidate, succinylcholine, propofol, versed, fentanyl, and tylenol.  She was admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure. .
Pt is a 78 yo male with h/o A fib, s/p multiple CVAs, CHF, HTN, DM2 admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**12-31**] with abdominal pain and n/v since that morning. Pt's vitals on admission wer significant for T 104, SBP 100s, HR in the 120s. RUQ U/s demonstrated multiple small gallstones with sludges without evidence of pericholecystic fluid or significant dilatation of the gallbladder. Surgery was consulted for concern of cholangitis with probable sepsis. Pt was admitted to the SICU, intubated overnight for ERCP procedure and fluid resuscitation. The patient was placed on zosyn. Pt's INR was eleveted as he was on home coumadin. He was given 4 units FFP in anticipation of ERCP the following day. On [**1-1**] ERCP demonstrated a large filling defect in the distal duct representing a stone with CBD dilatation. A biliary stent was placed after the removal of the stone. Pt was extubated the next day. He was then transferred to the medicine service.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11183**] is an 83 M with a history of systolic CHF, s/p MVR on coumadin, chronic kidney disease, and dementia who experienced the sudden onset of abdominal pain this morning around 9:00 AM while at his podiatrist's office.  He was referred to the ED where he was noted to have pain out of proportion to exam. He underwent CT scan which did not reveal acute cause of his pain. While in the ED, he had a bowel movement with a small amount of bright red blood, then another with more blood, then a third with more blood. He simultaneously became tachycardic to the 120s though maintained his blood pressure. After administration of a dose of IV morphine, his pain resolved. . Upon arrival to the ED vitals were: T 96.8, HR 88, BP 116/64, RR 16,  100% on RA. He received 4 mg IV morphine for pain and 500 cc IVF, after which he dropped O2 sat to upper 80s which improved with deep breaths to mid-90s. GI team was consulted from ED and stated they would consult on patient tomorrow, no urgent intervention unless decompensates. His PCP/cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] from the [**Name (NI) **] and recommended giving FFP in the setting of bleed despite his mechanical valve. While in the ED, he received 4 mg IV mophine, 500 cc IVF, IV Zofran, 1 unit FFP (started). He was ordered for a unit of pRBCs but did not receive it. Vitals prior to transfer to the MICU were: Afebrile, HR 124, BP 122/80, O2 sat 94% on RA. . MEDICINE HPI: In brief, this is a 83M with dementia, chronic systolic CHF with an EF of 30-35%, Afib and MVR on warfarin, and dementia who presented with BRBPR. He was taken to the ED where he received a bolus of NS 500 mL x1 and became more hypoxic. Given his abdominal pain and bleeding, a CT scan was done of his abdomen and GI and General Surgery were consulted. The CT showed no acute abdominal process and severe cardiomegaly with mixing artifact in the spleen. Given his comorbidities, borderline BP, and risk of bleeding he was admitted to the MICU for further management. In the MICU overnight his H/H were stable and he was ultimately called out to Medicine for further management. Of note, review of notes and history shows that the patient had been having severe abdominal pain, but he does not relate that history. . On the floor he is oriented to person only. He denies any pain or SOB but is on oxygen. He reports that he is thirsty. He cannot fully explain why he is here, but reports "all kinds of problems" as leading to his admission. .

Ms. [**Known patient lastname 11228**] is a 66 yo female with PMH of CAD, dCHF and chronic dyspnea with minimal exertion, afib s/p AVJ ablation and pacer, COPD, moderate to severe pulm HTN thought secondary to elevated left atrial pressures and not intrinsic lung disease, possible lupus pneumonitis vs cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (based on pulmonologist note), and DM who is transferred from [**Hospital 11229**] for management of respiratory distress and hypoxia. . She presented to [**Location (un) **] on [**6-3**] two days after sudden shortness of breath and DOE which she experienced while folding clothes. She normally uses prn home oxygen, but had used it at all times in the 2 days prior to presentation. She also had a HA, dysuria, right LE edema. She denied CP, palpitations, LH, wheezing, upper respiratory symptoms, hemoptysis. She reportedly appeared volume overloaded on CXR. She was given a diagnosis of bronchitis. An LE ultrasound in their ED was negative for ED and she was sent home on inhalers. She had a chinese food meal that night. She represented to their ED the next day after she awoke and felt worse. The CXR at that point was oncerning for pna. A BNP was 483, later up to 1050. She was given 40mg of IV lasix and admitted. She developed worsening SOB during her stay. A CT scan was read as consistent with pneumonitis and on [**6-4**], she was started on IV solumedrol. On [**6-6**], she received another 60mg IV lasix. Other complications during her stay included ARF with Cr up to 1.9, felt likely prerenal, and hyponatremia to 124 thought [**2-17**] hypovolemia. . On [**6-7**], she had an episode of respiratory distress requiring transfer to the ICU. At that time, notes report that she was still felt to be fluid overloaded. She was on 2L of O2 upon admission with sats in the low 90s. Starting on [**6-6**], she consitently required 5-7L to sat around 90%. . Her pulmonologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **], saw her at [**Location (un) **], was concerned about inflammatory pneumonitis and initiated the steroids. He feels that this is probably vascular pneumonitis and less likely hypersensitivity pneumonitis. He reports that she has had a negative [**Doctor First Name **], normal ANCA, ACE level borderline at 73, and negative hypersensitivity pneumointis panel. Her ESR has been persistantly elevated. . She was given 2g CTX and 750mg of levofloxacin prior to transfer. . 7.47/31/61 on 6L [**6-6**] 7.49/22/59 on 6L . CK 37, trop 0.04 on [**6-6**] . An ECHO during her stay showed distal septal and apical hypokinesis with EF of 40-50% and [**1-17**]+ MR, moderate to sever TR, pulm HTN with pulm systolic pressure estimated at 50-60, and right-sided pressure and volume overload. . . Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 444**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 432**] (cardiology) recently prescribed Revatio on [**2854-5-11**] to trial for her dCHF. She started in on [**2854-5-15**]. .

84 yo male history of prior stroke with right facial droop, COPD on home O2, OSA on bipap, pulm HTN, HTN, MR, and CHF with EF 50% who was sent in from the [**Hospital3 **] home after being found at 9pm with unresponsiveness and pinpoint pupils. FS was 108. He was non-responsive to Narcan given by EMS. In the ED, initial VS were: 96.8 176/80 48 100% on "20L". Upon arrival to the ED, a right facial droop was noted and there was not a lot of history from the facility or EMS so a Code Stroke was called. Initially, he was able to open his eyes to sternal rub, so he was intubated for unresponsiveness and airway protection given concern for an evolving stroke. The ED noted a difficult and inferior intubation. He received atropine 0.5mg prior to intubation for bradycardia to the 30's. He was given Fent/Versed after intubation.  No response to more Narcan in ED. More information was then gathered. He had been at rehab for coughing leading to syncopal episodes and rehab after prior strokes. He was intermittently brady at the facility with BP 63/48. Patient on alfa-2 eye drops for glaucoma with constrict pupils. Portable CXR after intubation noted that the ETT was low and was subsequently pulled back [**2-13**] cms.  A RIJ was placed for SBP of 80.  Repeat CXR was ordered.  He was given levofloxacin for a UTI.  A CTA of the head and neck was done to rule out stroke.  Neurology was consulted.  Neuro consult recs noted: CTA attempted, contrast not perfused adequately. Transcranial doppler (TCD) done on basilar artery showing flow to 110mm, makes clot unlikely. Most recent vitals prior to transfer: afeb 47 103/61 500x14 50%x5. On arrival to the MICU, pt is intubated and sedated. His vital signs were stable.  Of note, the patient's dry weight is 247-252lbs.  The patient called his wife this morning to say "goodbye". He has been in the hospice section of nursing home for end stage CHF.
Mr [**Known patient lastname **] is an 84 year old male with a history of obstructive sleep apnea, COPD with a home 2 L O2 requirement, complicated by pulmonary hypertension and RV failure who presents with a syncopal episode 1 day prior to admission.  At baseline, Mr [**Known patient lastname **] has a history of likely vascular dementia, with 2 prior CVAs resulting in weakness, difficulties with memory recall, and verbalization.  He was also recently admitted in [**Month (only) 400**] for an unresponsive episode which led to a short period of intubation secondary to respiratory distress.  Currently he lives in a rehab setting and was previously on symptom-focused care for management of his end-stage RV disease and COPD. One day prior to admission, he had witnessed syncope at his nursing home in the morning while moving his bowels. Thereafter, his family noted that he was quite lethargic and difficult to arouse.  No fevers or hypotension were noted.  He was brought to the ED given his persistent lethargy and recent syncopal episode.  Chest-xray revealed pulmonary edema and he was given a dose of lasix.  Initial vitals were: pain 3, T 98.9, HR 82, BP 172/135, RR 28, POx 100% on nasal cannula.  He was somnolent but arousable to voice, answering yes/no questions. Felt short of breath.  labs were notable for WBC 12.1, Lactate 2.9, Cr 2.3, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 11233**]; his UA was positive for >180 WBCs.  He triggered for desatting to the 80's on RA; with 3L NC he was 88%.  CXR confirmed pulmonary edema so he received Lasix 60mg IV as well as Levofloxacin/Ceftriaxone (no infiltrate but had leukocytosis and elevated lactate).  Received SL NTG x2.  ABG was pH 7.41, pCO2 48, pO2 48.  ED plans for BiPAP but have not started it yet.  He is admitted to the MICU due to hypoxia and respiratory distress; VS prior to transfer were HR 72, BP 195/119, RR 25, POx 90%4L NC.
55 year old male with progressive intolerance for activity over the previous 12-18 months. He was found to have a murmur on exam with his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] revealed severe AI.  He was referred for TEE which confirmed severe AI and showed flail right coronary cusp.  He is referred for surgical evaluation.
The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented to [**Hospital6 33**] with chest pain on [**2653-7-31**] and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 341**] for management of an acute myocardial infarction. He has a history of atrial fibrillation since [**2642**], deep venous thrombosis, and colon cancer.  His cardiac risk factors include a remote smoking history, hypercholesterolemia, and a family history of myocardial infarctions. He was in his usual state of health until the morning of [**7-31**] when he developed acute chest pain when getting up at 4 a.m.   The pain appeared localized mostly to his back without any radiation.  He did not have symptoms of dyspnea. No nausea, and no diaphoresis.  He was able to go back to sleep and woke up again at 5 a.m. with severe squeezing chest pain localized to the anterior chest.  He rated the pain [**11-17**]; again no radiation, no dyspnea, no nausea, and no diaphoresis were noted.  He had never had this type of chest pain before.  He also had not experienced any recent changes in exercise tolerance of being able to walk about one flight of stairs (limited by dyspnea and not limited by pain).  He did not give any history of orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  He does have chronic leg edema which has not changed recently. He was brought to [**Hospital6 33**] where he received four doses of sublingual nitroglycerin which relieved the chest pain temporarily.  An electrocardiogram at [**Hospital6 3376**] showed ST elevations in V2 to V6.  His cardiologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11234**] at [**Hospital6 1689**], but due to an unavailability of beds he was transferred to [**Hospital1 341**] for cardiac catheterization. The initial electrocardiogram at [**Hospital1 188**] showed marked ST elevations in leads I, aVL, and V2 to V6, with reciprocal depressions over the inferior leads, as well as a right bundle-branch block pattern, and left axis deviation. Cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 186**] showed total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery after first heart sound, diffuse irregularities in the right coronary artery, but no significant disease in the left main coronary artery and left circumflex.  The left anterior descending artery occlusion was successfully stented; however, no reflow resulted. He was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for management of his acute myocardial infarction.
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 6599**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with a history of COPD, depression, TIA, GERD, left CEA, HTN, macular degeneration, who was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management of abdominal pain and elevated liver enzymes. She was in her usual state of health yesterday before developing sudden onset of severe right upper quadrant pain at 7pm, which was constant, nonradiating, and accompanied by multiple episodes of vomiting over the course of the night. She was diaphoretic and reported a pressure sensation extending essentially from neck to her lower abdomen.  She denies previous similar episodes, and has no history of biliary disease though two daughters are s/p cholecystectomy.  She subsequently presented to OSH ED this morning, where a CT abdomen revealed a thickened gallbladder wall without evidence of stones. She was given ciprofloxacin and flagyl, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management. In the ED, her initial vitals were 99.6  84  124/69  16  96%/2L. She was intermittently tachycardic to >100, and a note was made of a transiently low BP to 80s systolic, however subsequent pressures were normal.  Her abdominal exam revealed some guarding.  Her RUQ U/S revealed gallbladder wall thickening with gallstones, but no evidence of CBD dilation.  Her transaminases and AP were strikingly elevated.  Her troponin was elevated to 0.2, trending up to 0.55 prior to transfer with a CKMB elevation to 15. She received aspirin at the OSH this morning. While her EKG was not available on arrival to floor, note was made of ST depressions laterally.  Surgery was consulted and recommended perc-bili drain due to poor surgical candidacy. ERCP also notified of case. On the ICU floor, her VS were HR77, BP135/110, RR21, Sat 100%3LNC.  She was comfortable and denies any further abdominal pain.  She is hungry.  No current chest pain.

The patient remained symptomatic and was taken to the [**Hospital1 188**] by EMS where she was found to have a systolic blood pressure of 210.  She was given aspirin, Lopressor 5 IV times three, Lasix 40 IV times one and was started on intravenous nitroglycerin drip with resolution of all symptoms.  The patient also has undergone a CT angiogram that showed no evidence of dissection.  The patient had a chest x- ray that showed right costophrenic angle opacity.  The patient's CT showed signs of left ventricular strain.  By the time she was seen by the Coronary Care Unit team, her systolic blood pressure was in the 180's and she was symptom free. ALLERGIES:  Colchicine, allopurinol, ethambutol.
HPI:  73-yo-woman w/ CAD, CHF, ESRD presents w/ dyspnea x 12 hours.  She was feeling well until 1 day prior to admission during dinner, when she developed acute onset dyspnea assoc w/ substernal chest pain.  The pain was "achy," moderate severity, non-radiating.  There were no assoc palpitations, cough, nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.  ROS reveals no fever, weight loss, increasing edema, orthopnea, PND, or dietary indiscretion.  She has been taking all her meds as prescribed.  Her last HD session was the day prior to presentation to the ED. . In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was initially hypertensive w/ BP 210/110, HR 80, O2 sat 100% on BiPAP. She was treated w/ nitro gtt, hydralazine 5mg IV, and enalapril 1.25mg IV x 1, and BP improved to 190/82. Chest pain resolved early during her ED stay.   She was dialyzed urgently and admitted to the MICU where she had no further CP or SOB.  She was called out to the floor after 1 day.
73 year old woman with multiple medical problems including ESRD (On HD qMWF), CAD, CHF, HIV (CD4 198), DM2, Hyperlipidemia, and Hep C who presents to the ED this morning with speech difficulty and right facial weakness.  The patient herself is unable to provide a history at this time.  According to family, the patient woke up this morning around 5:30AM.  She was last seen well yesterday evening.  upon awakening this morning, she apparently tried to call another relative to report that something was wrong.  During that phone call, however, her speech was unintelligible.  The family went to the house to check on her and found her ambulating with non fluent, nonsensical speech.  She followed occasional commands, but appeared "confused".  Her daughter noted a right facial droop.  EMS was called and she was brought to the ED.  Neurology consult was called at 8:30 AM and I was present at the bedside within at 8:35AM. According to the family, she has had occasional diarrhea over the last week.  Otherwise, she has been healthy.  She had her regularly scheduled dialysis yesterday. She was recently admitted to the medicine service [**Date range (1) 12271**] for fever.  She was felt to have a viral infection, all cultures were negative.
Briefly, patient is an 82 y/o M hx DM2, CKD, presented with hemetemasis, Hct drop, lightheadedness. Patient presented to the ED after he had 1 episode of hemetemesis with associated dizziness. He was found to be orthostatic in the ED, and NG lavage was positive for 100 cc of dark red blood. He underwent an EGD in the ED which revealed only mild gastritis but no obvious source for upper GI bleed. He was transfused 2 units pRBCs and transferred to the ICU for further monitoring. . While in the MICU, his antihypertensive medications were held and he remained HD stable with no further episodes of hemetemesis and no melena or BRBPR. His diet was advanced to clears and his clonadine was reintroduced . On transfer he denies nausea, vomiting, dizziness, CP, SOB, abd pain. He has not had a BM. He reports feeling well.
Admission information and pertinent hospital course: 84 year old male c DM, HTN, OA, afib not on coumadin, CKD stage IV, Chronic CHF recently discharged [**Date range (1) 12313**] for R ankle pain (resolved on own, no etiology) and mild heart failure exacerbation, is readmitted on [**7-20**] for Chest pain. While in ED, had episodes of hematemesis, thus was admitted to MICU. As for chest pain: Pt reports experiencing a sharp, stabbing, left sided CP started [**7-20**] am, on/off since that day. Reproducible on exam. EKG unremarkable. Trops negative. Pain is better today. Thought to be musculoskeletal with possible GI component. As for episode of hematemesis. Has chronic anemia, but recent admission his hgb was lower than baseline ([**7-28**]) to 6.5, hemeoccult neg, no obvious bleeding, got 2U. had no GI complaints, was told to follow up. This admission, initially no GI complaints other than chest pain. No melena, no further hematemesis. NGL was performed in ER, and per report showed old blood that cleared after 700 cc's. He was started on IV PPI and transfered to MICU, where per notes, another NGL done, still old blood, but easily cleared. NGT removed [**1-20**] nausea/discomfort. Seen by GI. hgb and vitals have been stable, thus EGD defered to [**7-23**] am. Over past couple days, has c/o intermitted periumbilical/epigastric pain, but that has also resolved by time of transfer to floor. He is tolerating clears. Of note, pt with hematemesis approx 1 year ago. EGD at that time showed some gastritis in the antrum. He was prescribed high dose PPI. Also, while in ER, initially CXR with possible RLL PNA, started on levaquin, no fevers/white count/cough.
84 year-old right-handed man with a history of hypertension, long-standing diabetes, and atrial fibrillation (not on anti-coagulation or anti-platelet therapy due to a history of gastrointestinal bleeding), and chronic kidney disease (creatinine baseline ~[**1-22**]) who presented earlier today after a fall with left hip pain; a code stroke was called at 8:13 pm, after concern for a right MCA infarction on CT of the head. According to the patient's daughter, with whom I discussed the case over the phone, the patient was in his usual state of health until awakening this morning.  At that time, he reported difficulty seeing multiple objects in the kitchen, including a kettle on the stove as well as a cup.  He did not further describe the character of the vision loss.  His daughter thought that this was unusual in a well-lit room, but attributed the difficulties from recently awakening, transitioning from the dark to light.  He did not have any clear weakness, difficulty with speaking or comprehension.  He has chronic tingling in his fingers related to diabetes, though no new sensory changes. At approximately 2 pm, he tripped over a cord as he walked from the kitchen, and fell forward.  He was able to break his fall with his hands on a nearby table before landing on the floor of the study.  There was no observed head trauma nor loss of consciousness.  He reported pain in the left hip and was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  Once at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient underwent a trauma evaluation for his fall.  He was reporting pain and given 4 mg of morphine  at 5:55 pm for his discomfort, then 50 mg bendadryl at 6:04 pm for subsequent itchiness.  An attempt to perform CT scan was made around this time (~6 pm), but the patient was sent back as he was becoming increasingly confused and unable to sit still. He subsequently received 1 mg of lorazepam at 6:42 pm, then developed apneic periods for ~10-15 seconds at a time over a period of 20 minutes, by ED report.  He received the CT of the head at 7:45 pm and a code stroke was called at 8:13 pm after a preliminary read of a right middle cerebral artery stroke. Review of Systems: Unable to obtain at this time due to confusional state.
84 yo M h/o systolic CHF (EF 20-25% in [**3-28**]), HTN, afib on warfarin, CKD (baseline Cr 2.1), DM2, and L MCA CVA who presented with anemia from nursing home. He was recently d/c'ed from [**Hospital1 18**] after an admission [**Date range (1) 12318**] for generalized weakness attributed to CHF exacerbation. Today, on routine lab check his Hct was 22 from baseline of low 30s, and Cr 3.7 from baseline 2.1. There was reportedly no evidence of acute bleeding at his NH. Pt was alert and oriented to self and place, however VS were notable for a HR of 130s and sat of 84% on RA. He was brought to the ED. . On arrival, patient was reportedly somnolent. His SBP was in the 70s and his sats were 80's on room air. Exam revealed guaiac positive stool with melena. Hct was 21 with INR 4.0 He then vomitted and was intubated for airway protection. An NG tube was placed with lavage reportedly negative, but NG tube later drained out 50cc of frank red blood. He had a torso CT that was unremarkable. Head CT initially raised some concern for SAH but upon reviewing, neurosurg considered the findings old infarct without hemorrhage. ECG showed slow afib with no ischemic changes. Trop was 0.17 with flat CK. Cr 3.9 from baseline 2.1. He received one dose of vanc and zosyn, 2L of fluid with improvement in BP and therefore got a femoral line placed with initiation of norepinephrine. He received 3 u pRBCs, 4 FFP, vitamin K 10 mg IV x 1, and activated facotr IX. After blood and FFP transfusions, Hct improved to 30 and INR decreased to 2.2. GI saw the patient in the ED, recommended EGD in a.m. with serial Hcts and suppportive care. . Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**3118-4-23**] to [**3118-5-3**] for CHF exacerbation. He was discharged to rehab with furosemide 120 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Furosemide has been held for 2 days prior to this admission with plan to restart on day of admission. . Complete review of systems is unable to be obtained due to patient's sedation and intubaiton. .
This is an 85 yo m w/ a hx gastric/small bowel AVMs, recently admitted for shock attributed to a GIB, afib, CHF (EF 20%), CRI (stage 4), who was transferred from rehab for altered mental status and worsening renal function. He was noted initially at rehab to have worsening creatinine, and was scheduled to be seen in renal clinic as an outpatient. Then today, he developed AMS, and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. . In the ED, the patient was altered, with initial vitals found him to be hypothermic, hypotensive to 60-70's, brady to 30-40's. He received a femoral line, calcium, 1500cc NS (not more out of concern for possible cardiogenic shock). A bedside shock u/s did not demonstrate a pericardial effusion but showed global hypokinesis, and a large right sided pleural effusion. A CT torso demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions R>>L with associated atelectasis and cardiomegaly, but no intraabdominal pathology on wet read. A UA was dirty. Lactate was wnl, CE's were within his baseline in the setting of renal failure. EKG was notable for low voltage afib with bradycardia but no ischemic changes compared to prior. BNP was 3200 (which is in the middle of recent values). He received a dose vanco/zosyn. He was guaiac pos brown stool initially. An ABG was notable for a respiratory acidosis and he was intubated with etom and rocuronium for airway protection and increased minute ventilation. Of note, he was a difficult intubation and there was a ?edema in airway. He was also started on levophed after he did not respond to 1.5L NS. Because he was hypothermic, a rectal probe was attempted to be placed, and he then was found to have a "puddle" of BRBPR, but then nothing actively coming out. NG lavage negative. GI was consulted and evaluated him in the ED, but felt that given his stable hct (28 -> 29) that this was unlikely to explain his shock. He was type and screened, and received 2 units in ED. Urine output was poor throughout ED stay. . He is transferred to the MICU for further management of hypotension, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory failure and hypothermia. Upon transfer, HR 66, BP 113/64 on levophed 0.12mcg, satting 100% on A/C 500x14 peep 5 and FiO2 1.0. . Of note, pt was recently admitted from end of [**Month (only) 115**] to [**5-31**] for hypotension, respiratory failure and GIB. Hct did drop at that time to 21 with reports of melena. EGD was normal w/o AVMs seen. Recent [**Last Name (un) **] [**3-28**] normal as well except for some small polyps. During recent hospital course, pt intubated for presumed CHF, had worsening renal failure, and also found to have new parietal CVA. Coumadin held given bleeding and pt d/c'd to rehab on [**5-31**]. . Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) unable to obtain, patient intubated and sedated.
81 year old male with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a pacemaker x 5 years for complete heart block; presents with sudden onset of shortness of breath this morning ([**2603-2-17**]) at 5am.  He was awakened out of sleep with difficulty breathing that improved when he sat up.  He called his son on the phone, then called the fire department and was subsequently taken to the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department. . He admits to having orthopnea and PND.  He denies chest pain, dizziness, syncope, headaches, cough, fevers/chills, or nausea,vomiting,or diarrhea.  The patient states that he has experienced some exertional dyspnea in the past.  He admits that he has a limited activity level due in part to dyspnea, but he mainly complains of bilateral lower extremity pain with walking, that improves with rest.  He describes this pain as arthritis in his knees and hips, but also has pain in both calves as well. . On admission he stated that he feels a lot better since being in the hospital on oxygen.
64F hx CAD s/p MI in [**2533**] with 2 DES placed to the pLAD, iCMY EF 45-50%, HTN, HLP who presented to the ED with chest burning.  At 4am she awoke with substernal chest burning radiating to the back associated with nausea, no vomiting or dyspnea. . In the ED, she was found to have EKG changes with ST elevations in V1-V2.  She was given heparin, plavix loaded, full strength aspirin and morphine/SLNTG for pain. Catheterization demonstrated total occlusion of the LAD in the proximal portion of her previous stent.  Thrombectomy was performed and another DES was placed.  She was transferred to the CCU for further management. . Upon arrival to the CCU, she was chest pain free and felt comfortable.  She was on a nitroglycerin drip and was hemodynamically stable.
79 yo male with hx of CVA, CAD, OSA with recent ED visits for changes in mental status who presents initially with confusion and is being admitted to the ICU for fever and hypotension. The patient remained somnolent so hx was taken by the patient's wife [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12359**]. She reports that for the last 2 weeks the patient has complained of generalized weakness worse in his legs with frequent falls. There has been no head trauma or LOC with falls. His somnolence has increased to the point where he has been bed bound for 1 week only getting up to go to the bathroom but was occassionally incontinent of urine in the bed. He has not been getting up to urinate or have a BM for the last 2 days and had fallen 3 times but refused to go to the hospital. Yesterday the pt's daughter thought he was febrile and urged him to go to the ED, but he again refused. After another fall last night, the police insisted and he was brought to [**Hospital 4139**] hospital. There he was found to be normotensive but had a fever to 102 and was given a dose of moxifloxacin 400mg x1 and then tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. . In the ED he was found to have a fever to 103 with mild RUQ and RLQ tenderness. He then developed hypotension with SBP's in the 70's so a precept catheter was placed. He initially had a CVP of 12 so levophed was started and pressures improved quickly. RUQ US was equivocal but he was seen by surgery who felt there was no cholecystitis but he was given Flagyl. He was ordered for CT abdomen and admitted to MICU prior to obtaining the study due to prolonged prep.
Patient was admitted today to [**Hospital1 1498**] and being transferred to CCU. Please refer to [**Hospital1 1498**] note for further detail. In brief, Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 75 yo male with CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**3078**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM1-OM2, occluded SVG - PDA), s/p two cypher stents to SVG-OM1-OM2 graft in [**3091**], HTN and HLD. He was transferred from OSH  after a syncope at 3 am this morning. EKG in ED showed evidence of a recent IMI (new Q waves with residual ST elevations). . Per [**Hospital1 1498**] admission note, urgent cath showed occlusion of the jump segment of his SVG-OM1 graft, which was stented successfully with 2 drug-eluting stents. However, the OM1 was jailed and could only be rescued to TIMI 2 flow. . On the floor today, he had one episode of chest pain in the afternoon which resolved with sublingual nitro after which he had SBP 70s; this resolved. He had no recurring chest pain during the day. This evening at 9PM, he tried to get out of bed to use commode. Eyes rolled back into head, became unresponsive, SBP 70s with no change in rate. Was placed in Trendelenberg, was given IVF, woke up on his own. . Upon interview by resident, patient was awake, oriented, comfortable, angry about lab draws and denied any chest pain during episode. Tele was not caught at time of episode because he was getting up to use the bathroom. . Patient was fatigued and did not want to share history on admission to CCU. He did deny chest pain. Per admission note, he complains of chronic fatigue but found that 1-2 weeks ago he started to have shortness of breath to the degree that he was only able to walk a few steps. Of note, the patient paused aspirin and plavix three weeks ago for 12 days for his laser BPH surgery.
The patient is a 61 year-old female with multiple medical problems including end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, congestive heart failure with an EF of 45 to 50%, coronary artery disease, hypertension and repeat admissions for congestive heart failure secondary to hypovolemia who presents with shortness of breath on the morning of admission.  The patient reports a hard time sleeping on the night prior to admission and then at 5:00 a.m. developed dyspnea without chest pain, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis or other symptoms.  She denies fevers or chills, night sweats, dietary indiscretions, and noncompliance that would explain failure.  She is typically dialyzed Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  Her blood pressure in the Emergency Department was 210/100 and given intravenous Hydralazine before being seen by the medicine team.
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 12388**] is a 73 year old female with multiple cardiac risk factors and known coronary artery disease since [**3475**]. Given worsening shortness of breath and angina, she underwent stress testing which was positive for ischemia. Subsequent cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital6 4949**] revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease including a 50% left main lesion. LVEF was normal. Given the above, she was referred for surgical revascularization.
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with history of chronic UTIs and hypothyroidism.  For the past several weeks, she has had cold-like symptoms and post-nasal drip, but has been eating and drinking normally with normal activity levels. She has had symptoms of what her daughter says are UTIs and has been on levofloxacin for approximately 10 days. She went to her PCP ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) today for evaluation of "slowness" and "lethargy", at which time a chest x-ray and labs were ordered; the initial chest x-ray demonstrated cephalization suggestive of CHF. However, after her daughter brought her home, she "decompensated" further. She was unable to get up and/or ambulate, at which time her daughter brought her to the [**Name (NI) **]. She denied any focal weakness, slurred speech, chest pain, or shortness of breath. In the ED, she was noted to have crackles [**2-19**] way up bilaterally and poor air movement. Vitals in the ED were T97, HR 90, BP 135/72, RR 28, O2sat 85% which improved to 96% after being placed on BiPap. An EKG was obtained, demonstrating a supraventricular tachycardia (sinus tach with PAC's, atrial fibrillation, MAT), and she was given 20mg IV Lasix and started on a nitro drip; after diuresis she was able to come off BiPap. She was given ceftriaxone and levofloxacin and sent to the ICU.
69 year-old female with CAD s/p RCA stent x 2 (last one [**3096-1-10**] post IMI), CHF with EF 60%, PVD s/p aorto-bifem bypass, and s/p left brachial pseudoaneurysmal repair, transferred from [**Hospital3 3778**] with fever and hypotension, as well as troponin leak. Of note, she was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3096-1-10**] with sudden onset right-sided CP and SOB, and was found to have NSTEMI (ST depressions in lateral leads, peak troponin of 5.0), with mild CHF. A cardiac catheterization revealed 95% RCA stenosis (in-stent re-stenosis). A RCA Cypher stent was placed with 10% residual stenosis. She was discharged home on [**3096-1-11**]. On [**3096-1-23**], she presented to [**Hospital3 3778**] [**Hospital3 **] with non-exertional right-sided CP, along with SOB, which is her anginal equivalent. Symptoms lasted approximately 1/2 hour, and were improved but not resolved with SLNTG. In the ER her vital signs were stable with T 97.0, BP 147/64, RR 18, Sat 98%RA. JVP was elevated at 6cm, lungs with end expiratory wheezes. An EKG revealed NSR with RBBB, no acute changes. Her initial CK was 25, trop 0.04, WBC 4.8, and Cr 0.9. She was treated with aspirin, nebs for possible COPD flare, and started on heparin IV for possible unstable angina. While in the hospital, she had a Myoview, showing an inferior filling defect. On the night prior to admission to the [**Hospital1 18**], she became hypotensive with SBP to low 80's, temperature to 104, CK of 300 and CKMB 15.7, trop I 13.5. Her BP did not improve with fluid resuscitation, and she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU on neosynephrine and heparin IV for possible re-cath. Of note, she was on 50% FM, with decreased UO. Further history revealed a sister with recent influenza and hospitalization. ROS otherwise negative for worsening orthopnea, PND, DOE, diarrhea, dysuria.
The patient is a 73 year old female who presented preoperatively for an elective mitral valve replacement as well as coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  She has had recurrent episodes of congestive heart failure, and chest pain.
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 11376**] is a pleasant 73-year-old female who presented preoperatively for an electrode mitral valve replacement, as well as coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  She has had recurrent episodes for congestive heart failure and chest pain.
This is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral valve replacement with a porcine valve, atrial fibrillation, history of rapid ventricular response, diabetes mellitus, MRSA endocarditis, left atrial thrombus originally admitted to [**Hospital1 341**] on [**2748-4-3**] complaining of headache, nausea, vomiting and increased INR originally 11.2 to 15.6 on day of admission after being on Coumadin for left atrial thrombus and porcine mitral valve.  The patient had a head CT which showed a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the cerebellum with mass effect.  The patient was originally admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit after she had a posterior fossa craniotomy for resection of left cerebellar hemorrhage and areas of necrotic cerebellum. HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Neurology:  The patient was status post cerebellar hemorrhage thought to be originally an embolic event with hemorrhagic conversion due to elevated INR.  As mentioned above the patient underwent posterior fossa craniotomy for resection of the hemorrhage as well as for resection of areas of necrotic cerebellum.  The patient did well postoperatively and had a small amount of drainage from her wound on postoperative day number three which was treated with additional sutures.  No drains remained in place.  From a neurological perspective, the patient had follow-up head CT scans on [**4-5**] and [**4-7**] which showed no evidence of hydrocephalus, no enlarging collection and no new infarct. The patient's neurologic examination had been relatively stable with the patient's inability to speak, but ability to move all extremities and intermittently follow commands as well as opening eyes to voice. The patient was restarted on her anticoagulation when she was transferred to the medical floor as her underlying etiology of the stroke was thought to be embolic in nature, and given her porcine mitral valve, it is important that she would be anticoagulated to prevent further strokes even though the risk of anticoagulation was also stroke. The patient initially had some improvement in her neurological examination, however it was intermittent in nature.  The patient underwent extensive further testing with repeat head CT that again showed no evidence of hydrocephalus or new stroke on [**4-15**].  The patient also had an MRI and MRA of the head to further evaluate for microthrombi.  The study was somewhat limited secondary to staples causing artifact, however there was no acute cortical infarct, with normal ventricle size and configuration.  The patient did have chronic microvascular ischemia and infarction that was old.  There was good flow to most of the intracerebral to cranial arteries.  The patient also underwent EEG and the report is still pending at the time of this dictation. 2. Infectious disease:  The patient initially had positive blood cultures on [**4-2**] which grew out two of two bottles of MRSA.  Given that the patient had just completed a full six-week course of IV vancomycin, two weeks of gentamicin, and four-and-a-half weeks of Rifampin on prior admission for MRSA endocarditis, it was thought that potential left atrial thrombus was seated with bacteria which may have represented the positive blood cultures.  Subsequent blood cultures during the hospitalization did not grow MRSA.  The patient was treated with vancomycin for presumed MRSA bacteremia and continued to have a slightly elevated but stable white blood cell count and remained afebrile. The patient was also thought to have a pneumonia given her large right pleural effusion status post intubation x 2 while on the neurosurgical intensive care unit.  The patient was treated with a [**7-1**] day course of Zosyn IV for this. 3. Pulmonary:  The patient initially had a clear chest x-ray on admission however subsequently developed bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  The right pleural effusion was tapped and about 1.4 liters of fluid were removed which were transudative and thought to be secondary to her overall volume overload and anasarca on this admission. The patient was intubated x 2 and subsequently remained extubated after [**2748-4-8**].  Pulmonary consultation was obtained and the patient had drainage of right pleural effusion as mentioned above and in addition was diuresed with some improvement in her bilateral pleural effusions, however they did recur but appeared to remain relatively stable. 4. Cardiovascular:  The patient had a transesophageal echocardiogram on [**2748-4-4**] that showed a 1.7 cm left
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: CC:  80 yo F with AS s/p biprosthetic AVR in 12/99, MR with most recent LVEF of 55%, Afib, asthma/COPD referred who was initially referred for RHC +/- exercise, and possible LHC for progressive shortness of breath who was found to have hemoptysis of 150 cc during RHC after SGC was inflated. Pt has had long history of SOB. Of note she was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital3 1425**] hospital for worsening SOB with dyspnea on exertion. She was treated for CHF with diuresis and for her pulmonary disease and was d/c. At home pt reports DOE and is unable to climb stair or walk far without symptoms. She has no dyspnea at rest.Humidity exacerbates her SOB. She sleeps with 1-2 pillows and denies PND or LE edema. Recently the patient has been seen by her outpatient cardiologist to determine whethere the SOB is directly related to MR prior to any definitive treatment or surgical intervention. For these reasons she was referred to have a RHC +/- exercise +/- LHC/coronary angiography. . On review of system, pt reports dyspnea on exertion, cough, hemoptysis. . She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

The patient is a 51 year old woman with a history of diabetes [**Hospital **] transferred from an outside hospital for a cardiac catheterization on [**2781-3-23**]. One week ago, the patient noted onset of epigastric pain while walking with no radiation, no vomiting, no diaphoresis but increased shortness of breath.  The pain was alleviated by resting.  The patient also noted lower extremity edema times two week with one week of Lasix.  Orthopnea was present.  The patient presented to outside hospital on [**3-19**], noted to have electrocardiogram with ST changes.  Chest x-ray with overt congestive heart failure. Echocardiogram at outside hospital demonstrated severe global left ventricular hypertrophy, moderate global right ventricular hypertrophy, severe mitral regurge, moderate to severe tricuspid regurge, moderate PA systolic hypertension with EF of 20%.

46-yo-man w/ active cocaine use presents w/ LE edema.  10 days ago, he developed b/l LE edema that has gotten progressively worse until now.  Three days ago, he developed dyspnea on exertion when climbing stairs, assoc w/ 2-pillow orthopnea and PND.  He denies any recent chest pain, palpitations, headache, confusion, weakness, numbness, abd pain, or hematuria.  No recent viral syndromes or URIs.  He does admit to cocaine use last night. Today, his wife convinced him to present to the ED for evaluation. . In the ED, his BP was 230/170.  BNP was elevated at 7500.  CXR revealed evidence of cardiomegaly and pulm edema.  He was treated w/ ASA 325 mg, lasix 10 mg IV, and hydralazine 10 mg IV x 2.  He responded well to lasix w/ good UOP, but diastolic BP remained elevated at 170, prompting initiation of nitroprusside gtt.  He is now admitted to the CCU for further care.
Patient is an 88-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, status post prior CABG in [**3151**], paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary hypertension, who presents status post episode of amaurosis fugax. In terms of his coronary artery disease, he denies any angina or need for nitroglycerin.  His last cardiac catheterization was in [**3157-7-9**] for increased edema.  At that time, his EF was noted to be 55%.  He had 2+ MR and severe tricuspid regurgitation.  Angiography revealed native three vessel disease, a patent LIMA, and occluded graft.

Pt is a 66F with complex medical history significant for DM2, HTN, ESRD and h/o of multiple HD line infections, transferred to medicine from the ICU where she had been recovering from proteus bacteremia and sepsis. Per report, pt was in her normal state of healthy until [**2725-5-21**], when she went in for dialysis through Right IJ tunneling line and developed rigors one hour into the procedure. She was given 250mg Vancomycin x 1, blood cultures were apparently collected and she was referred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management. . In the ED initial VS were noted to be HR 123, BP 156/88, RR 28, Sat 83% on RA. She was triggered for her hypoxia, her hypoxia improved to 98% on 4L. She further developed hypotension to the 70s, and was started on Levophed. Initial labwork was notable for WBC 9.6 (86%N), Hgb/Hct 12.6/42. Chem panel showed BUN/Cr 30/5.7, and CXR showed mild vascular congestion. Subsequently 5/6 bottles grew pansensitive GNR, speciated to be proteus. He was started on vanc/aztreonam/tobramycin initially, changed to cipro on [**5-24**] following speciation and sensitivity. HD line has been pulled and culture final report shows no growth. Infectious workup have been negative thus far: 1) CT initially showed increase in bile duct size from 7 to 10mm on CT, concerning for early obstruction, but MRCP that was unremarkable (no stenosis, stone, dilation). 2) TTE was of poor quality due to poor body habitus, and could not definatively r/o veg . Pt has been off of levophed since [**5-24**] 4PM. Pt has been hemodynamically stable. She was dialyzed today ([**5-26**])via a temporary right femoral groin line. She needs a new tunneled HD line for permanent access by IR prior to discharge. However, her INR is 3.6 today. She has not gotten any vitamin K, need to have INR <1.5 tunneling line to be placed.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname 11561**] is a 66 year old woman with history of metastatic breast cancer (diagnosed [**3194**], history below) who presented on [**3205-4-5**] (two days prior to transfer) for left-sided VATS with subsequent pleurex catheter placement for recurrent presumed malignant left-sided pleural effusions. She reports that she first developed shortness of breath several months  ago ([**Month (only) 213**] [**3203**]) and was found to have a left-sided pleural effusion, and she underwent thoracentesis; subsequent cytologic analysis showed malignant cells consistent with known adenocarcinoma. The shortness of breath had improved temporarily but recurred within several weeks; the pleural effusion had reaccumulated. She was admitted on [**4-5**] after successful thoracoscopy, pleural biopsy, and placement of a Pleurex catheter. During the admission, she was noted to be in and out of atrial fibrillation, alternating from tachycardia to sinus bradycardia, and with systolic blood pressures in the 70's - 90's. Cardiology was consulted and recommended increasing the beta blocker while holding lisinopril and Lasix. Given the tachycardia and hypotension, an echocardiogram was performed demonstrating large pericardial effusion and evidence of RV collapse. She went for pericardiocentesis on [**4-6**]. Drainage from the pericardium was initially brisk but then slowed down and stopped as of 6pm on [**4-6**]. She was loaded with amiodarone. The morning of [**4-7**], she continued to be hypotensive. Echo showed small anteroapical pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade. Her creatinine was noted to be increasing (from 1.4 to 1.9 to 2.3) with continued hypotension despite multiple fluid boluses (totaling ~2L). She is transferred to the CCU for further management. On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

56 y/o female with a h/o hyperlipidemia who presented to an OSH on the AM of [**3004-11-4**] with 10/10 substernal and left-sided chest pain, radiating down the left arm. Per patient, she noted the onset of SSCP Friday AM at work. The pain lasted for about an hour and resolved without any intervention. Was not associated with any SOB or other symptoms. Subsequently, on Saturday afternoon, she again developed the same SSCP, this time radiating to her left arm, associated with nausea. Denied associated SOB. Pain persisted until Sunday AM when she finally presented to the OSH. EKG there revealed STE in V2-V4. She was given SL nitro x 3, Lopressor 5 mg IV x 3, ASA, Plavix loaded, heparin bolus + gtt, and integrillin bolus + drip. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] urgently for cardiac catheterization. In the cath lab, she was found to have a totally occluded proximal LAD. She had two stents placed to her LAD. She then became hypotensive and was resuscitated with IVF. An IABP was placed along with a femoral Swan. Upon arrival to the CCU, she was hemodynamically stable and chest pain free.

This is an 85-year-old male with multiple medical problems, who presents with a one day history of pleuritic back pain and shortness of breath.  It began the night prior to admission when he took a deep breath and noticed a pain between his scapulae.  It became progressively worse, to the point where he was unable to take deep breaths.  He had no recent cough, fever, chills, chest pain, headaches, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, weakness or dysuria.  His ambulation was limited by claudication, not dyspnea on exertion.  He denies baseline shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, or lower extremity edema.  He had a recent right upper lobe pneumonia in [**Month (only) 202**], status post a seven day course of levofloxacin with an additional admission in [**Month (only) 213**], as his pneumonia did not clear.  At that point, he had a parapneumonic effusion that was tapped and showed to be exudative.  He received a second course of antibiotics, namely Levaquin and Flagyl, at that time and underwent bronchoscopy to look for an obstructive lesion.  The bronchoscopy revealed an apical right upper lobe endobronchial lesion, but the biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage were negative for malignant cells.  He was followed up by his pulmonologist as an outpatient in [**Month (only) 354**], and was doing well.  He was asymptomatic at that time.  The plan was to repeat a CT scan in [**Month (only) 1082**] to look for resolution of his air space disease. He presented to the Emergency Room, where he was febrile, and a chest x-ray showed opacification of his right lung, questionable infiltrate vs. effusion.  He was started on levofloxacin and Flagyl and admitted.

She denies headache, abdominal pain, dysuria or diarrhea.  She also complains of a two week history of dyspnea on exertion with severe bilateral lower extremity edema and increased abdominal girth.  She denies chest pain, lightheadedness or palpitations.  She reports low back pain secondary to abdominal girth and tightness.  In the emergency room bedside ultrasound revealed little ascitic fluid to tap.  In the emergency room she was given 1 gm of Tylenol, 40 mg of IV Lasix, 500 mg of levofloxacin p.o.
77 yo M s/p MI x 2 and CABG x 4 in [**2605**]. Did well until [**2619-3-5**] when he had a VF arrest and had cardiac cath with LCx and RCA stents at [**Last Name (un) 1705**]. He was also found to have [**2-16**]+ MR and was referred for surgery.He wears an external defib life vest.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 12477**] is a 62 year old male with remote history of MI (in setting of cocaine abuse), HTN, hyperlipidemia, ESRD on HD, Hep C with Stage IV liver fibrosis, s/p L exostectomy, ulcer excision and bone stimulator removal ([**3157-8-20**]) presented from rehab due to chest pain and worsening shortness of breath. He was transferred from the [**Location (un) 919**] House to [**Location (un) **] ED where he was found to have a BNP of 1594, but no ST segment changes on EKG. His 1st troponin was 0.26 and the 2nd was 4.16 so he was started on IV heparin. He was then transferred directly to the cath lab at [**Hospital1 18**].
76 yo female with ESRD, DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia, diastolic dysfunction, sarcoidosis presented to ED after waking up this am with sharp, pleuritic chest pain and dizziness. CP improved with sl ntg x2 but dizziness persisted. In ED, found to be hypotensive to sbp 70s initially. However, 1 hour later pt brady'ed to 30s with associated hypotension to 70's responsive to 0.5mg atropine followed by dopamine drip to 10 mcg. EP consulted with plan for possible pacer placement. . Pt was chest pain free in sinus brady with sbp to 200's on dopamine. Dopamine drip weaned down, pt coded and given atropine and dopamine. Seen by EP who felt it was sinus arrest. . ROS: She complained of abdominal pain with associated nausea but this is baseline for her. Otherwise no CP, SOB, f,c,v. .
79yoM with h/o OSA, CAD s/p MI and CVA, diastolic CHF admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 12567**] with sepsis secondary to Klebsiella bacteremia, admitted again on [**7-14**] to Urology service from rehab with acute renal failure, transferred to MICU [**7-15**] with MRSA bacteremia, ARF, and respiratory failure. . Patient was admitted [**Date range (1) 12567**] with sepsis due to Klebsiella bacteremia.  Source of Klebsiella infection was not known, but was thought to be from pneumonia seen as retrocardiac opacity on CXR.  Urinalysis was negative at that time.  He was intubated during that admission for airway protection and hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Although he has OSA, he is not a CO2 retainer.  He was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] to complete at 14day course of levofloxacin, to which the Klebsiella (from culture at [**Hospital 4139**] Hospital) was sensitive.  During his initial presentation he did develop ARF with creatinine up to 2.8 from baseline of 1.7-1.9.  Creat returned to baseline during the hospitalization.  It rose to 2.0 prior to discharge after ACE-I was restarted. . He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED [**2524-7-14**] after two days of intermittent right sided abdominal pain, decreased urine output, anorexia, and temp spike to 101.  According to the patient's wife, he did not feel himself soon after admission to rehab, refusing to eat, being lethargic and unwilling to participate in rehab activity.  In the ED patient found to have ARF with creat 7.3, [K+] 5.1.  CT showed right UVJ stone, right perinephric stranding, left ureteral stone, and hydronephrosis.  He was admitted to Urology service and underwent left percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement.  He was also found to have UTI and was started empirically on Vanc/Levo/Ceftriaxone.  Urine culture and blood cultures (4/4 [**7-14**]) grew MRSA, and CTX/Levo were discontinued [**2524-7-16**].  Despite nephrostomy tube placement, patient continued to have ongoing oliguric renal failure, which renal felt was due to persistant obstruction vs ATN.  He was not hemodialyzed. . On [**2524-7-17**] he underwent right ureteral stent placement, retrograde pyelography, and removal of stones.  He remained intubated post-operatively. On [**2524-7-20**]- Pt also complained of right wrist pain/swelling and subsequently was found to have septic wrist. This was irrigated and debrided on [**7-20**]. Cultures positive for MRSA. On [**2524-7-22**], pt was extubated. On [**2524-7-23**], pt transferred to CC-7A. Reported feeling weak. Denied HA, dizziness, chest pain,palpatations, SOB, cough, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, edema.
74 yo F with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, carotid stenosis, hypercholesterolemia, afib, lacunar stroke, who presented to the ED complaining of weakness. She was found to have severe bradycardia, hypotension and acute on chronic renal failure. She was initially treated with kayexalate and atropine intially. However, upon arrival to the MICU goals of care were further discussed. After multiple family meetings, the decision was not to proceed with further workup and have the goals directed at comfort measures only. She was changed to morphine prn and zofran. Additionally she was given NTG prn for back pain with relief.
78 y/o F with a hx of PMR on chronic steroids, type 2 DM, CHF w/EF 50%, DVT [**8-1**] who presents with a one day history of diarrhea.  Pt reports she woke up in the middle of the night a day ago and had diarrhea.  She had six episodes throughout the course of the day and felt weak.  She had no other symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, dysuria, urinary frequency, or any other complaints.  No recent travel or change in eating habits. * In the ED here, she was febrile to 101, hypotensive to 88/49, tachy in the 100s.  Cultures were drawn and she was given levofloxacin and flagyl given the abdominal pain.  Her initial lactate was 2.9, she had a WBC count of 20 with a left shift and 8% bands, and her creatinine was elevated at 1.3 from 0.9 3 months ago.  An abdominal CT was done to r/o an abscess (given that she's on chronic steroids) and it showed diverticulosis but no diverticulitis, as well as stable dilation of her CBD.  She was given 2 liters of IVF and her lactate worsened to 4.  She remained hypotensive in the 80s-90s.  She was mentating and making urine throughout.  At this point, because of the lactate and hypotension, she was placed on the sepsis protocol.  A central line was placed, and a mixed venous sat was monitored (low 70s).  She received an additional 2 liters of NS and her bp remained in the 90s.
This is a 72-year-old female who has undergone endovascular procedures on both legs and is recently status post right first and second toe amputations which were found in the clinic to not be healing well. The patient was admitted for repeat angiography which revealed no endovascular options. The patient was then deemed a candidate for a distal bypass.
This is an 80-year-old man with a history of DM II, HTN, AS (valve area 1.1), medium-[**First Name3 (LF) 12265**] vasculitis and seronegative arthritis (on prednisone and hydroxy-chloroquine), 3-[**First Name3 (LF) 12265**]-disease (LM 70%, Mid LAD 60%, Ramus mild disease, OM1 100%, Distal RCA 100%.) awaiting CABG, and atypical fibroxanthoma of the nose requiring radiation who presents to ED with chest pain, shortness of breath, and vomiting during radiation treatment.  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 12760**] was subsequently transferred to the MICU with low BP, melena, Hct drop, ST depressions in V3-V6, and elevated troponin.  In ED, CXR showed new mild pulmonary edema, moderate right pleural effusion, mild cardiomegaly, L>R bibasilar atelectasis. . Cardiology consult in the ICU concluded that elevated troponins were likely reflective of demand ischemia/NSTEMI rather than plaque rupture.  Cardiac symptoms occurred in setting of pulmonary edema and anemia, putting added strain on an already diseased heart.  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 12760**] could not be started on a heparin drip due to nasal bleeding and melena. . Patient was transfused 3 units of blood in the ICU and responded appropriately (went from 23.9-->29).  It was thought that anemia was most likely the result of a slow nasal bleed rather than an acute GI bleed.  Although held initially in light of bleed and low BP, patient was eventually continued on ASA, statin, plavix, BB, and [**Last Name (un) **]. . Upon transfer to the floor, patient was in good spirits.  His cardiac enzymes were trending down and EKG changes were resolving.  Vitals on transfer were: T: 98.7, HR: 64, BP: 126/55, 94% on RA. . ROS:  Patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, chills or any other concerning symptom.
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 12764**] is a 65-year-old female, with multiple medical problems including COPD, diabetes mellitus, history of a DVT, and hypothyroidism, who was transferred from [**Hospital 1543**] Hospital on [**11-23**], after failing to wean from the ventilator.  The patient, according to the hospital transfer, had a sore throat for four or five days, and symptoms of a lower respiratory tract infection. She presented to [**Hospital 1543**] Hospital on [**11-17**] and proceeded to rapidly decompensate with hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure.  She was found to have a left lower lobe consolidation and required mechanical intubation. The hospital course there was notable for thick pulmonary secretions, an MSSA growing out of sputum, and a chest CT showing extensive alveolar interstitial process involving both the left and right lung, with left greater than right. The patient underwent bronchoscopy.  It was notable just for the thick secretions.  She received aggressive antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin, tazobactam, Levofloxacin and clindamycin, but was unable to be weaned from the ventilator for persistent hypoxemia.  She was transferred to [**Hospital6 253**] for further evaluation and treatment of her hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure.
65 F h/o HTN, AFIB, s/p AVR/MVR [**1-21**] RF, developed low back pain and dark stools 3d PTA. She presented to PCP ~2d PTA, and left a stool sample.

She is on a heparin gtt to allow her INR to drift down in preparation for procedure.
The patient is a 77 year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease admitted to the MICU for increased dyspnea on exertion.  The patient was admitted on [**7-7**] after complaint of increasing shortness of breath for many weeks.  In the Emergency Department he had decreased mental status and respiratory failure.  He was admitted to the MICU for treatment of this.
The patient is a 74 year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease (single vessel disease of RCA, status post stent in [**Month (only) 400**] of 199), congestive heart failure class 3, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, and prostate cancer, presenting with shortness of breath over the past few days.  The patient was seen at [**Hospital 12817**] Clinic, where he was noticed to have pulmonary rales, lower extremity edema, after which patient was referred to the emergency department for evaluation of congestive heart failure.  The patient stated that he had not taken his medication (the patient had been on Lasix and Digoxin among several other medications) for the past few days as he had been out of them.  In the emergency department, the patient was noted to have an oxygen saturation of 82 percent on 5 liters nasal cannula oxygen.  The patient was normally on 3 liters of oxygen at home.  The patient's oxygen saturations had improved to 96 percent on 100 percent nonrebreather mask.  In the emergency department, the patient was also noted to be in sinus tachycardia at 124 beats per minute.  The patient was given 40 mg of Lasix intravenous twice in the emergency department, after which he put out 1200 cc of urine.  For his rate, the patient was given 5 mg intravenous diltiazem, after which his rate decreased into the 80s.  The patient had also admitted to an episode of chest pain the night prior to presentation.  The patient stated that the chest pain was mild, radiating to bilateral shoulders, with relief with one sublingual nitroglycerin.  The patient stated that he had always got chest pain off and on of similar nature.  The patient denied diaphoresis, nausea or vomiting.  The patient did admit to occasional light headedness. The patient admitted to a stable two pillow orthopnea. Patient denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  The patient admitted to increased leg swelling and shortness of breath at rest.
The patient is a 73 year old male with moderate severe aortic stenosis and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease admitted three times in the past six months for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, most recently last week.  The patient had arranged a visiting nurse.  The patient met compliance to assure he is on his proper medications at home.  Per the daughter, the patient is unable to keep his medications straight and he sometimes misses doses.  The patient is here with similar symptoms to prior admissions and states he feels better off his medications.  The patient was administered intravenous steroids and oxygen by face mask in the Emergency Department, and he was transferred to the floor where he became more short of breath.  He has had some fevers at home reportedly and intermittent atypical chest pain episode on the day prior to the day of admission, left-sided pleuritic pain and general discomfort with dyspnea. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems was negative for headache, vision changes, change in appetite and positive for chest pain with shortness of breath, negative for orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, edema, diaphoresis.  Occasional constipation, no bright red blood per rectum. ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies. HOME MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol 2 puffs q.i.d., Afrin 81 q.d., Atrovent 4 puffs b.i.d., calcium carbonate 500 t.i.d., Flovent 2 puffs b.i.d., Lac-Hydrin prn, Levofloxacin finished this course on [**11-2**], Prednisone taper ended on [**12-3**], Protonix 40, Serevent discus, Vitamin D.
The patient is an 86-year-old Russian female with coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypercholesterolemia, who presented with chest pain and dyspnea on exertion.  The patient had known three vessel disease diagnosed on cardiac catheterization in [**3274**] and managed medically since that time. During a preoperative workup for a hemicolectomy last year, the patient had an exercise tolerance test that was significant for a limited exercise tolerance and ischemic ST segment changes with focal left ventricular systolic dysfunction in the absence of anginal type symptoms, thought to be consistent with inducible ischemia.  She was admitted and ruled out for a myocardial infarction in [**3279-8-29**]. Her angina equivalent was dyspnea on exertion and her exercise tolerance was about one quarter of a mile walking before needing to stop and rest.  Prior to that admission, she had only occasional chest pain on exertion, usually brief and responsive to rest or one sublingual nitroglycerin. Since then, she had no chest pain but worsening dyspnea on exertion. Approximately three days prior to admission, the patient experienced her usual shortness of breath accompanied by nonradiating chest discomfort described as a tightness with pressure but not necessarily pain, which lasted approximately two hours.  She took two sublingual nitroglycerin tablets, which helped alleviate the symptoms.  The episode was not associated with diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, syncope or lightheadedness.  Since then, she had two additional episodes of the shortness of breath, but not with the associated chest discomfort.  The patient had three pillow orthopnea for many years, as well as chronically edematous ankles.  The review of systems was otherwise unremarkable. The patient was referred to the [**Hospital1 186**] emergency department by her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 9227**], for presumed unstable angina.  In the emergency department, the patient was not experiencing shortness of breath or chest discomfort.  An electrocardiogram done at that time was unremarkable for ischemic changes.  The patient was subsequently admitted for suspicion of a myocardial infarction.
[**Age over 90 **] yr old woman with history of htn, chf, prior CABG in [**3280**] and prior NSTEMI in [**3286**] and [**3287-10-29**] that was treated conservatively presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**3288-2-21**] with 10/10 chest pain associated with N/V on and off since Saturday. The pain comes at rest, is not associated with exertion or SOB. Denies diaphoresis. Describes it as pain and pressure. At [**Location (un) **] her pain resolved with 3 SL nitro, and her imdur was increased. Initial troponins were negative, but rose to peak of 1.34. On the morning of [**2-23**] she had an episode of nausea, wretching, chest pressure. She was found to have new lateral ST changes - 2mm STD in V4-V5. Trop of 1.34. Resolved with reglan, NTG. She was loaded with plavix and started on heparin gtt. Also, CXR revealed possible right lower lobe pneumonia and question of CHF. She was treated with Levaquin (3 days of 250mg IV) and 40 IV Lasix on day of transfer with only moderate UOP. Vital signs at OSH: 99.4, hr 79, rr 20, 93% on 3L, 131/65. . On arrival to floor she was comfortable on 3L NC O2, without chest pain or shortness of breath. . On the morning of transfer she developed severe chest pressure and pain with associated N/V. An ECG showed 2-3mm depressions in V2-6 with 2mm elevation in aVR consistent with left main disease. She was given NTG SL x1 with resolution of her CP as well as Zofran for nausea. She was continued on her heparin drip, loaded with Intergrillin 12.24mg, and started on Integrilin 1mcg/kg/min and sent emergently to the cath lab.
Patient is an 88 year old male with multiple medical problems including CAD s/p CABG in [**2509**], prostate cancer s/p xrt and HLD presenting to the ED with abdominal pain. Patient has been in the ED for greater than 12 hours when our service was consulted. Per preexisting reports by emergency department patient presented with epigastric pain versus chest pain and was ruled out for an MI. He continued to have back pain as well as epigastric pain thus the CTA of the torso was obtained to rule out aortic dissection. Patient underwent a non-contrast CT scan prior to the CTA. He continued to have some abdominal pain versus discomfort and received a total of morphine IV 15 mg by the time ACS surgery was called to examine the patient. At the time of our exam patient was very sleepy and minimally engaged. He was difficult to arouse. He was able to answer questions appropriately, but was unable to recall some history information.
[**Age over 90 **] yo female s/p recent R Occipal Lobe infarction, AAA, CAD, PVD, HTN presents to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED after she was unable to communicate with her son over the phone. At home, her son found her to be lethargic and called EMS. She was initially presented as being "unable to walk," but upon arriving to the ED, she was able to move her LEs and she was found to be AAO x 3 despite having a blood pressure of 46/36. - At this time: HR: 80s   RR: 20  92% on 4L NC - Started on peripheral dopamine - 3 peripheral IVs were placed when cordis attempt failed - She was also started on peripheral neo for better BP control; this was eventually weaned off prior to coming to the ICU. - 3.5L IVFs - Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone - Per the family, this declined any surgical interventions or any further attempts at a CVL.
89 M with CAD and pafib presented from home with MS change. He sustained a mechanical fall in [**Month (only) 400**] and was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] to rehab on [**2856-2-17**]. At that time, notes already suggests that he had some confusion. I talked to the daughter this evening and she reports that he was intermittently confused at rehab as well. The family took the patient home five days ago and then brought him to the ED for ongoing and worsening confusion and agitation. . In the ED, a CT head was ordered but he was unable to cooperate so he was sedated and intubated for the study. He was obtunded after the study and was tranferred to the MICU because there was difficulty extubating him. . In the MICU, there was a concern for acute stroke since his pupils were noted to be unequal. The stroke team was called and MRI/MRA was done that did not show acute stroke. Apparently, his unequal pupils are not new. . The cause of his mental status change was unclear. The thought at this time is toxic metabolic, which Neuro agrees with. There was a question of seizure in the MICU but EEG was unrevealing. LP was done and did not show infection. . Currently he is still agitated and the daughter notes a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 681**] course.
89 yr old F with severe aortic stenosis and atrial fibrillation scheduled for AVR who was admitted prior to cath.

This is a 71 year old male with chronic ischemic post-infarction cardiomyopathy who [**Month/Day/Year 1811**] an attempted upgrade to biventricular ICD  by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2927-5-15**]. Initially, the LV lead was implanted, but dislodged shortly thereafter. Despite multiple attempts, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was unable to find a suitable position for capturing of the left ventricle.  The implant was therefore abandoned and he has been left with his DDD-ICD. He denies receiving any defibrillator shocks, palpitations or syncope.  His main symptoms are exertional shortness of breath and fatigue.  Given history of technical difficulties, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] advised against another attempt at transvenous placement, and recommended Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 902**] perform epicardial left ventricular lead placement via mini thoractomy.
49 year old man with dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 15-20%, chronic atrial fibrillation who was admitted after undergoing unsuccessful placement of BiV pacer/ICD at [**Hospital 7817**]. At OSH they were able to place RA/RV leads, but procedure was complicated by unsuccessful cannulation of coronary sinus, and development of acute dyspnea thought to be pulmonary edema. Patient was given nitro gtt, cefazolin 2grams, lasix 80mg IV lasix in cath lab, amiodarone 400, cozaar 25, coreg 6.25 given at OSH. Zofran 4mg IVx1. Was on 2L NC prior to transfer. . On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient was stable and without chest pain or shortness of breath on 2L NC. Generally patient describes being symptomatic in his atrial fibrillation. He was able to go for a 14 mile bike ride this past week, however. . At baseline, patient reports 2 pillow orthopnea, no LE edema, recent weight gain, PND, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. . On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
Briefly, this is a 71 M with a history of CAD s/p CABG in [**2956**] complicated by VT in the early recovery period and systolic heart failure (EF ~10%), s/p ICD and pacemaker placement who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for elective upgrade to a single BIV-ICD system.  He underwent this procedure on [**2975-7-13**] which was complicated by bleeding at line insertion site in neck (hematoma at site). Otherwise he tolerated the procedure well. He was originally planned to be D/C'd home, but was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1498**] service after becoming hypotensive with systolics in the 60s. He received a 250-cc bolus with NS with some improvement (SBP in 80s-90s). However, he has made very little UOP over the next day (Foley was removed at ~6:00 AM and there was no further UOP recorded). In addition, creatinine has increased from 1.3 to 1.9. A bedside echo was performed by the cardiology fellow to rule out effusion or tamponade (none present). Given persistently low BPs and possible need for vasopressors to maintain UOP, he is being transferred to the CCU. . Of note, he underwent placement of a Ventack P ICD in [**2956**] with 2 epicardial sensing leads and 2 epicardial patches. This was changed to a Ventak mini- generator in [**2966**] with placement of an SVC coil. The SVC coil by CXR on [**2975-6-13**] is noted to be in the right atrium as opposed to the SVC. He has not received any therapies from his ICD in 20 years according to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1546**] note dated [**2975-6-13**]. In [**2968**], the patient subsequently had a St. [**Male First Name (un) 1507**] pacemaker placed in the right subclavian system. He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who recommended left-sided biventricular ICD with extraction of the leads done under general anaethesia in the OR. . On review of systems, he endorses right wrist pain since his sprain with limited range of motion. Also has chest wall tenderness since his procedure. He had a recent syncopal episode after rising to get out of bed in [**Month (only) 946**]. No recent lightheadedness. He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. No dysuria. All of the other review of systems were negative. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.  He does sleep with two pillows at home but states this is to prevent neck discomfort. . On arrival to the ICU, he reports that his thinking is clear. Denies lightheadedness. Denies pain other than with palpation of chest wall. No current SOB or other complaints.

(Amended ICU admission HPI) .. Ms. [**Known patient lastname 13053**] is a 69yo F with ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, HTN, CHF (EF 60-70%, 3+ MR) and GAVE who presents following an episode of hematemesis and maroon stools at home. She was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**4-10**] - [**4-15**] after developing "dark" BM that were guaiac positive. At that time, she was found to be more anemic than usual and was given IVF and 2u pRBC in the ER, after which she developed flash pulmonary edema and required intubation and a short stay in the MICU. She was then scoped and underwent an Argon plasma coagulation procedure after which she did very well. Hct upon d/c on [**4-15**] was 31%. At that time, the plan per GI was to repeat EGD on [**3340-4-28**]. Of note, during her last hospital stay, she was noted to have lateral TW depressions and + troponins which were felt to be due to demand ischemia. .. Reports that she felt well after discharge until this past Monday ([**4-18**]), when she reports she had to be taken off of her dialysis treatment b/c she didn't feel well. She states that she first felt tingling and pain in her fingers and toes, to the point where she was unable to put her feet on the ground. She felt generally weak and tired following dialysis and needed to be assisted back to her apartment. She spent the evening and most of the next morning in bed. Her nurse came to assist her the next day and offered her an oxycodone which she took, but then vomited what she described as brown liquid w/ white specks in it. No nausea prior to her vomiting. Her nurse said that it looked like blood, but denied that it was coffee ground emesis. After vomiting, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 13053**] immediately felt better. The nurse then called the pt's PCP who advised the pt to come to the ER. 15-20 mins later, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 13053**] then felt the sudden urge to have a BM and had a liquid maroon stool which was guaiac positive. She denies any abdominal pain associated w/ the BM. At that point, EMS arrived and transported her to the ER. On ROS, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 13053**] [**Last Name (Titles) 13059**]d any lightheadedness, dizziness, CP, SOB, or diaphoresis. + persistent burping, but that has actually decreased in frequency since her last admission. Between her last discharge and now, she had been eating normally and having normal brown, formed stools. She has never had an episode of hematemesis before. .. In the ED, she was tachycardic but normotensive. Her NG lavage showed brown fluid that cleared with 200 cc and her rectal exam revealed guaiac negative brown stool. Her Hct on admsiion was 38% and she received lL of NS and 1u pRBCs. She also received Anzemet 12.5 mg IV X 1 and pantoprazole 40 mg IV X 1. She was evaluated by GI and taken for an EGD which showed findings c/w GAVE. Her angiodysplasias were coagulated w/ an argon laser and the pt was transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for monitoring of fluid status and serial Hct's. She remained hemodynamically stable in the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] w/o any further episodes of hematemesis or melena, and her Hct remained stable, so she was transferred to the medical floor for futher monitoring. .

History of Present Illness: 72F with a history of type II DM, ESRD on HD, GAVE, HTN, MR, CAD, CHF w/ RV failure and seizure disorder with recent hospitalization from [**6-27**] to [**7-26**] with culture negative sepsis with MS change and c.diff colitis, who presents to the ED on [**7-27**] for HD.  Pt was discharged on [**7-26**] and was due for her HD today per her MWF schedule.  She was sent from rehab to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for HD due to her current diarrhea from c.diff colitis and concerns about her volume status.  She was seen in the ED then sent for HD with 2.5 fluid removed.  Prior to HD, in ED BP 131/76  RR 16  92% 4L. . Following her ultrafiltration, she returned to the ED for likely discharge back to rehab.  However, both during HD and on return to the ED, she was noted to be hypotensive, to as low as SBP 60s.  She received 2 L total IVF in ED with minimal response. She had a RIJ placed for access.  Her BP has since been labile and she has had BP to 67/42 with HR 89 at time of transfer to the floor.  The only laboratory sent at the time of admission to floor were CBC and chem 10. . Allergies: Aspirin / Aleve / Codeine / Depakote
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 13053**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, chronic right sided HF, congestive hepatopathy, persistent hypoglycemia, and afib/flutter on digoxin who was found unresponsive at her NH for up to one hour.  EMS was called, and the patient was found to be bradycardic to 30s, with a blood pressure of 80/palp.  Per the patient's family, she had no new fevers, mental status changes, and had her usual chronic cough. In the emergency department the patients vitals were:97.6, 80/palp, 46, 40, 92% on 4LNC.  She was intubated, and a right femoral line was placed.  Her EKG showed a junctional bradycardia at 48, which was thought to be consistent with digoxin toxicity.  A level was drawn, and the patient was administered 4 vials of digibind.  She was noted to have a hematocrit of 21 (her baseline is 27-30), and a lactate of 8. She was started on levophed and given 750mg levofloxacin, 2g of cefepime, 1g of vancomycin, and 500mg of flagyl IV for presumed sepsis of unknown etilogy.  Her blood sugars were in the 20s, for which the patient recieved two amps of D50.
This is a 89 year-old Female with a PMH significant for CAD (with 2-VD on cardia cath without PCI, s/p NSTEMI in [**2904**]), history of systolic CHF (now EF 60%), HTN, HLD, severe aortic stenosis (AV gradient 44 mmHg, [**Location (un) 108**] 0.56 cm^2 with valvuloplasty performed [**2-/2907**]), MR, dementia, hypothyroidism who was recently scheduled for CoreValve placement (on [**2907-9-6**]) but this was post-poned given that she experienced a mechanical fall from her wheelchair on presentation to the hospital. Her walker slipped backward and her head hit the floor. A CT head was negative. Her procedure was re-scheduled for [**2907-9-13**], but she presented to [**Hospital 10347**] [**Hospital3 **]'s ER on [**2907-9-7**] for a syncopal episode and she was found to be in sinus bradycardia with HR in the 50s. . This AM the patient's VNA noted that the patient had some abdominal discomfort. She started to feel better and went to move her bowels at 11AM and during Valsalva she developed lightheadedness and pre-syncopal concerns without LOC or head injury. EMS responded and the patient was evaluated at [**Hospital3 13140**] ED where her labs were reassuring, but she had episodes of sinus bradycardia to the 50s. She was without further lightheadedness, dizziness or chest pain. . Of note, she was initially thought to be too fragile and her dementia too severe for her to unfergo CoreValve placement, but by her [**2907-8-12**] appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 902**], she had markedly improved and was reconsidered for the CoreValve procedure. . The patient's most recent hospital admission was on [**2907-8-3**] to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for chest pain attributed to demand ischemia from her severe aortic stenosis. She was discharged on [**2907-8-5**] with her previous cardiac medications and the addition of Lasix 20 mg PO twice daily. . On arrival to the floor, the patient is without chest pain or trouble breathin. She has no nausea or vomiting, no abdominal complaints. She denies lightheadedness or dizziness. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or pre-syncope. . ROS: The patient denies a history of prior stroke/TIA, deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. They deny bleeding at the time of prior procedures or surgeries. Denies headaches or vision changes. No cough or upper respiratory symptoms. Denies chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness; no palpitations. Denies shortness of breath.

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of rheumatic heart disease with valvular dysfunction, coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction secondary to atrial thrombus, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and anemia, who presented with palpitations on [**3293-4-30**], and was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation.  The patient was rate controlled with beta-blockers and started on intravenous Heparin considering the fact that it was unknown whether she had been on her Coumadin at home, and her INR was subtherapeutic. Once the patient was stable from a cardiac standpoint, she underwent exam under anesthesia and a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for fibroids and pelvic pain and menorrhagia on [**3293-5-4**]. Postoperatively the patient was started on a Heparin drip. On postoperative day #2, she was noted to be slightly tachycardiac with good urine output with a slightly distended abdomen and a hematocrit drop from 31 to 25 for which she was given 3 U of packed red blood cells.  Her posttransfusion hematocrit was 26.  The patient however became progressively tachycardiac and oliguric, and on postoperative day #3, a CT of the abdomen revealed an intraperitoneal hematoma with portal venous air.  The patient continued to hemorrhage with a hematocrit drop to 19 and became progressively coagulopathic despite FFP.  General Surgery was consulted for further care of this patient.

This is a 67 year-old female with ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal tx on HD, recent admission for line sepsis, CAD, dCHF, hx PE, who presented to the ED with fevers and rigors and is transferred to the MICU for hypotension/concern for sepsis in the setting of HD. . Her recent history is notably for being hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 11933**] with fevers and culture negative sepsis presumed to be due to a line infection for which her HD catheter was removed and replaced. She had a TTE which did not show any evidence of endocarditis, and as nothing ever grew from her cultures, she was discharged after completing 2 week course of Vancomycin, stopping on 6/31. . On arrival to ED initial VS: 99 102 240/92 20 94% with 2 L, she was actively rigoring with rectal temp of 104, she reported some dyspnea then in setting of fever. Initially very hypertensive but CXR witout fluid overload. Blood cultures were drawn and she was given a dose of vanc/zosyn. She had no possible peripheral access. Given SVC syndrome, attempts at RIJ placement were unsuccessful, as pt has L tunned HD catheter, a femoral line was placed. She was also given tylenol, zofran and 1L NS with improvement in her symtoms. She had 1 episode of bilious vomiting, but no abd tenderness on exam. No localizing symptoms for infection. CXR suggested retrocardiac opacity, pt pt without SOB, cough, hypoxia. A viral NOS/flu syndrome was suspected, pt was admitted on droplet precautions for flu r/o. She does make a small amount of urine, but not enough to send for culture in ED. Here CBC was unremarkable with a WBC of 8.2. She had a trop of 0.11, during last hospitalization wsa 0.8.

She was given 2mg of morphine and became more somnolent and nauseous but stated that her pain was better controlled. Per her daughter she had started rigoring at 9pm; the family initially assumed she was hypoglycemic and gave her [**Location (un) 2418**] juice before coming to the ED. . She was undergoing HD on the morning of transfer had became hypotensive with BP in the 80s. No fluid was removed and she was given 300cc. Purulent material was noted to be weeping from her HD line and she was also tachypneic. She was then transferred to the MICU for further management. . On presentation, she was alert and oriented and c/o of lower abdominal pain which was relieved by a BM. She proceeded to have two other BMs of liquidy brown stool.

This is an 84 year old female with known coronary artery disease which has been medically managed. Given recent complaints of dyspnea and chest tightness, she saw her PCP the day prior to admission. The office EKG was notable for Twave inversions in V1-V3 and she was subsequently admitted for further evaluation and treatment.
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 11945**] is an 84 year old lady 6 weeks post CABG recently discharged home from Rehab returns to the ED with weakness, poor PO intake and R flank pain. In the ED, initial vs were: 98.2 76 87/50 14 92% RA. CXR was obtained.Patient was given Levaquin 750mg IV x1, 1000mL of NS. Vanc 1g ordered but NOT given. In the ICU, the patient complains of general tremulousness which is new, right sided flank pain worse on inspiration, anorexia and general weakness since leaving [**Hospital3 **] 2 days prior. She denies cough, fever/chills, chest pain, myalgia, abdominal pain. A conversation with the patient's daughter revealed that the patient returned from [**Hospital3 **] on the 11th. Blood pressures were stable until 2 days prior associated with weakness, nausea, poor PO intake, confusion. Confirms R flank pain, iced intermittently with relief, similar to previous spinal stenosis. Tremors are new from yesterday and today. Review of systems: Peritent positives and negatives per HPI Denies palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
The patient is an 80 year-old female with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF admitted for respiratory distress and hypertension. Per the patient's [**Year (4 digits) 795**] the patient had been increasingly somnolent over the few days prior to admission possibly due to the initiation of new anti-anxiety meds Trazodone and Effexor. The patient had no new complaints. She did, however, have her chronic abdominal pain for which she has had a thorough workup revealing nothing. The patient was denying any fever, chills, cough, dysuria, diarrhea, melena or bright red blood per rectum. Patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital3 **] after a COPD exacerbation and she is on a steroid taper as of admission. Of note, the patient prior to admission was recently treated with 7 days of antibiotics for a UTI. On the night of admission the patient was found to be short of breath at senior living home with O2 sats in the 80s and EMS was called. On arrival the patient was lying in bed on nebulizer treatment responsive only to sternal rub with audible rhonchi and wheezes. She was given Combivent, Lasix and placed on a nonrebreather and brought to [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department. On arrival the patient was tachypneic to the 30s, 82% on room air and improved to 100% on nonrebreather. Given her history of CHF she was placed on BiPAP at 15 and 5 and FIO2 titrated to keep O2 sats below 90s given her COPD. She was also given Solu-Medrol, Albuterol/Atrovent nebs, Lasix 40 mg IV, aspirin. The patient had a temp of 104.8 rectally and she was given Zosyn x 1. Patient then noted to be hypotensive to the 80s and she was given a 500 cc bolus and responded with systolics in the 100s. She then dropped her blood pressure again to 73/53 with a heart rate in the 130s and sepsis protocol was initiated. She had right IJ placed and Levophed was started. The patient received a total of 2 liters of normal saline in the ED. HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 80 year-old female with a history of severe COPD, CHF and 2 out of 2 subaortic stenosis who presented with respiratory distress. So essentially the patient presented in respiratory distress that was felt to be the likely combination of CHF exacerbation and COPD flare, question of pneumonia given bandemia and fever, but no clear infiltrate was seen on chest x-ray and lungs were clear on exam. No witnessed aspiration, but the patient's altered mental status over a few days make aspiration likely. Patient was continued on Atrovent and Albuterol nebs and Solu-Medrol. Diuresis was held given the patient's hypotension with plan on initiating diuresis once the patient's blood pressure was stable. She was covered for pneumonia with Vanc and Zosyn and given BiPAP to improve her symptoms of CHF. In terms of her hypotension and shock the patient's shock differential was considered to be sepsis versus cardiogenic shock versus renal insufficiency though likely sepsis given bandemia. Cardiac enzymes negative x 1. Vanc and Zosyn were given for presumed pneumonia. During which blood cultures were drawn and followed. Patient was given aggressive fluids and kept on pressors that being Levophed. Cord stem test was done and her response was found to be ineffective. Solu-Medrol was given for COPD flare. The patient's goal for DVP of 8 to 12 not greater then 65, grid greater then 30, holding all hypertension meds. These were the plans for her initial stay once she was admitted on [**7-27**], however, the patient's respiratory status continued to decline. She was not responding to BiPAP. Her CO2 continued to increase as she was not ventilating well. She was continued to be treated on Solu- Medrol, antibiotics, albuterol and Atrovent nebs, however, as her respiratory status began to decline the [**Hospital 225**] health care proxy her [**Name2 (NI) 795**] [**Name (NI) **] felt that the patient's wishes would be most consistent with being placed on comfort measures only. Eventually on [**2669-7-30**] the patient was made CMO by patient's [**Year (4 digits) 795**] [**Name (NI) **] her health care proxy. She was placed on a morphine drip and other medical interventions were withdrawn, the goal being to make the patient as comfortable as possible. Following her being placed on CMO, the patient appeared to be comfortable on her morphine drip. Eventually the patient did expire at 10:15 p.m. on [**2669-7-30**] of respiratory failure.

This is a 78-year-old right-handed male with a history of left frontal ischemic infarction in [**3162-12-6**], for which he was given t-PA complicated by hemorrhagic transformation.  His right-sided weakness and word-finding difficulties after that stroke have since resolved. He then had another left corona radiata stroke in [**3164-12-5**] with similar right-sided weakness and word-finding difficulties that also resolved.  He had a carotid ultrasound with less than 50% occlusion.  Transesophageal echocardiogram showed significant plaque in the aortic arch.  He was continued on aspirin and Plavix.  His most recent note from his Neurology appointment in [**Month (only) 944**] notes complete resolution of his right hemiparesis. He was in his usual state of health until the day of admission at 8:30 p.m.   He took a brief nap after dinner. He woke up and was "confused" and was having right-sided weakness, so he was immediately brought to the Emergency Department within 45 minutes of symptom onset. He is currently not able answer review of systems questions due to his aphasia.  His wife said he was fine until before his nap.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11965**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of hypertension, PVD, 2nd degree AVB, CVA, and chronic renal insufficiency who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] to rehab on [**1-12**] after an admission for urosepsis. He was gradually recovering his strength, but approximately 3 days prior to this admission he developed a mild, productive cough. However, per the nurses at his rehab his lungs sounded clear; thus, he was discharged as planned from rehab to his daughter's home on [**3343-1-23**]. At home, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11966**] cough worsened. The night prior to admission he lay awake with coughing fits. PO intake was unchanged (he voraciously ate lamb chops for dinner).

With the addition of lasix + Lisinopril, her Creatinine increased to 2.0, so both were stopped on discharge. Today, she denied CP, cough, edema. She was tachycardic with HR 120s and with O2 sats 100% on NRB, and diffuse wheezes on exam. She was initially treated with nebs, solumedrol, levoquin. ABG 7.21/54/73. Per the notes, she was thought to be hypotensive at the OSH as her BPs were being taken in her left arm despite a known history of inaccurately low BP in her left arm compared to her right arm. She was given 3600 cc NS.  She started to tire per report so she was emergently intubated. Her proBNP was 3300. In the ED here, her CXR was c/w CHF. She was given IV Lasix and aspirin and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**]. She is currently intubated and sedated. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unable to obtain as the patient is intubated. Per son, no f/c/sweats. no diarrhea/n/v.
[**Age over 90 **] yo F, h/o A fib on Coumadin, who fell twice 3/12am in bathroom and 5-6pm again in her bedroom, both time struck her left side of head on to ground. She was uncertain the cause of the falls, thought she may have lost balance. Denied LOC, HA, N/V, dizziness/lightheaddeness. No bladder/bowel incontinence. Able to ambulate after the falls.
[**Age over 90 **] y/o female from [**Hospital1 99**] w/ recent burr hole evacuation of SDH on [**3186-2-23**] came to [**Hospital1 18**] after cardiac arrest in the setting STEMI. . Pt was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3186-2-25**] after getting burr holes for evacuation of left subdural hematoma on [**3186-2-23**]. On the afternoon on the DOA had CP -> EKG showed ST dep in V2-4. Then she went into VFib arrest. CPR was started immediately and patient went back to sinus -> VTach -> Vfib -> sinus multple times and was shocked x6, given Lido bolus and started on Lido gtt. She was also intubated for airway protection. She was in NSR when she came into [**Hospital1 18**] ED. . In the ED, she had a CT scan of her head showed that the subacute SDH was stable. It was decided against performing cath given her risk of recurrent IC bleed.
[**Age over 90 **]yo F with a PMH of SDH s/p burr hole evacuation [**3186-2-23**], recent STEMI and medical management [**3186-2-26**], and multiple UTIs, now presents with CHF, fevers, and altered mental status. Ms. [**Known patient lastname 4342**] was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3186-3-11**] after a 4d hospitalization for altered mental status, felt to possibly be due to UTI and/or pneumonia (treated with levaquin) and benzodiazepine usage (ativan). Since discharge, she has been at [**Hospital 99**] Rehab. She had been on her baseline O2 requirement of 2L by nc, but over the last week, was noted to have increased O2 need and crackles on exam. Attempts were made to diurese her with 40mg IV lasix daily. A foley catheter was placed on [**3186-3-25**] for better I/O monitoring. After 3 days (which was 3 days prior to admission), she was noted to begin having mental status changes. Her family described her as being "wacky" and she had a fall (to her knees, no head trauma) on [**3186-3-28**]. On [**3186-3-29**], she continued to be disoriented and confused. She also began to drop her O2 sats again despite the diuresis, with O2 sats dropping to the low 90s. Her oxygen requirement was increased to 3L by nc with improvement in her sats. A UA was checked and was suspicious for a UTI, so she was started on levofloxacin. On the morning of [**3186-3-30**], she again became hypoxic with O2 sats in the 80s which improved to the high 90s on a NRB. She continued to be delirious and confused, so she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. In speaking to her RN at [**Hospital 99**] Rehab, the patient was noted to have lost 6 lbs in the last week (wt of 131 -> 125 lbs) with diuresis and there was a concern that she was becoming dry. She was also noted to have elevated fingersticks on [**3186-3-29**], with a FS of 470 (she is NOT a diabetic). With her delirium, she was not sleeping and was noted to have NOT slept in the last 48 hrs, which was unusual for her. She had been on a 1:1 sitter because she was attempting to get OOB on her own and was pulling at lines (foley, IV). [**Name6 (MD) **] her RN, the patient had been afebrile. She had NOT been on O2 prior to her MI, but has been on 2L of O2 since the beginning of [**3-1**]. . In the ED, her VS were noted to be T 102.4, HR 100s, BP 138/82, RR 28, sats 100% on NRB, 89-91% on RA. She was given 500cc NS in ER, then 40mg IV lasix (once her CXR returned). She had 250cc UOP in the ER. FS was 91. CT head was performed and showed resolution of her SDH. Given that her D-dimer was elevated, a CTA was performed and was negative for PE, but did show a large R sided pleural effusion and left atrial clot. She spiked a fever, so was given PR tylenol and levaquin IV. Her troponin also returned elevated at 0.20 and she was given a rectal dose of aspirin. She was admitted to the ICU for further monitoring of her respiratory and mental status.
58yoM s/p fall down 7 steps after ETOH, had immediate pain and continued with worsening nausea, neck pain, and headache as well as decreased mental status.  Brought to [**Hospital3 4047**] by friend, found to have sdh and sah and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  HD stable on arrival.
The patient is an 82 year old male with a past medical history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, status post left above the knee amputation, who does not regularly seek medical care, who presented to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 186**], on [**3433-11-8**], complaining of a two to four week history of shortness of breath, productive cough, congestion, brief choking sensation.  On arrival to the Emergency Department, temperature was 98.5, heart rate 90, blood pressure 139/71, respiratory rate 36, oxygen saturation 76% in room air. Of note, the patient's initial laboratories showed a bicarbonate markedly elevated at 38.  Chest x-ray at that time showed cardiac enlargement with mild upper lung zone redistribution with small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, questionable right lower lobe pneumonia. The patient was admitted to the C-Medicine service for management of congestive heart failure.  Also of note, CT scan of the chest in the Emergency Department ruled out pulmonary embolism. On the C-Medicine service, the patient was diuresed aggressively with Lasix 40 mg intravenously twice a day, started on Aspirin and Captopril, and was transiently on a Nitroglycerin drip for blood pressure control.  He was ruled out for myocardial infarction with three sets of cardiac enzymes.  With these laboratories, the patient's creatinine-kinase level was relatively flat, but he did have a slight troponin leak felt to be consistent with heart strain secondary to congestive heart failure. While on the regular floor, the patient had issues with confusion, agitation and refusing to take oral medications. This required one to one sitter as well as medication with Haldol and Risperidone.  On the evening of [**3433-11-10**], the patient had increased agitation and confusion.  He was medicated with Haldol and Risperidone.  At that time, he dropped his oxygen saturation to 66% on nasal cannula oxygen and was noted to have increased respiratory rate and some gurgling.  The patient was placed on face mask and given Lasix 40 mg intravenously, however, he failed to improve dramatically.  Therefore, he was intubated after rapid sequence medication with Etomidate and Succinylcholine. Prior to intubation, his arterial blood gases revealed 7.24/108/164.  This was consistent with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was therefore transferred to the CCU service where the thinking was that the patient could possibly have intermittent pulmonary emboli versus ischemia.  As the patient had elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine and was already over four liters negative for his hospital course, diuresis was held.  Echocardiogram was performed which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 50%, left ventricular hypertrophy, and evidence of diastolic dysfunction with E:A ratio of 0.67, and impaired relaxation.  No wall motion abnormalities were found.  The patient was worked up for pulmonary embolism via positive D-dimer, however, lower extremity ultrasounds were negative. A repeat CT scan of the chest was not performed.  This is in light of a negative CTA of the chest on admission. The patient was started on Heparin drip for anticoagulation. Heparin was later discontinued due to a large nosebleed.  The patient was extubated while in the CCU service on [**3433-11-12**]. Preextubation arterial blood gas was 7.37/81/80 on 50% nonrebreather face mask.  That evening, the patient demonstrated increased work of breathing.  Arterial blood gases were checked and showed values of 7.20/126/110.  The patient was agitated and received Haldol and Ativan.  Repeat gas was 7.14/131/128 with oxygen saturation 86%.  Chest x-ray was performed which showed a questionable left sided pneumothorax.  A repeat chest x-ray was performed in order to further evaluate possible pneumothorax.  In the interim, the patient was reintubated and a chest tube was placed by surgical staff.  During chest tube placement, the repeat chest x-ray was read as no evidence of pneumothorax. Decision was made to continue chest tube placement and chest tube drained 220cc of straw colored fluid.  All told the patient tolerated these interventions well. The patient was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit service for further management of his pulmonary issues including recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a previous medical history significant for Crohn's disease. She presently has evidence of a stricture in the distal terminal ileum, and because of that, the patient recently underwent laparoscopic creation of a diverting loop ileostomy. It should be added that the patient had this more conservative surgical treatment rather than a cecal resection because of poor heart condition and severe COPD, both of which were considered contraindications for more extensive surgical procedures. The ileostomy was created approximately 1 month ago, and since then the patient has been doing well up until yesterday when the ileostomy output suddenly stopped and the patient developed significant abdominal pain. Initial imaging studies with KUB and CT scan were consistent with small bowel obstruction close to the ileostomy, and there was some concern whether the patient had intraluminal content that created a mechanical obstruction. The KUB and CT scan did not show any evidence of free air. The patient was initially managed with a nasogastric tube and a Foley was also placed in the afferent loop of the ileostomy yielding large amount of small bowel content, whereafter the abdomen became less a tender and distended. Today, however, the abdominal pain has continued and worsened, and her abdominal exam has also worsened and we are concerned of  peritonitis why the patient now was taken to the operating room for exploration.
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old Russian- speaking gentleman with recent admissions for multilobar pneumonia, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 **] on [**5-9**], now being readmitted for hypotension presumed to be septic. The patient has had three recent admits to [**Hospital6 12662**] with a question of multilobar pneumonia for which he has grown out Stenotrophomonas in his sputum which has been ruled out for AFB on multiple occasions due to a right upper lobe cavitary lesion. Of note, AFB smears were negative as well as BAL. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] on [**4-29**] for further management and here he was started on a ten day course of vancomycin/meropenem for a cavitary pneumonia although sputum cultures were largely negative. His course was complicated by a COPD flare of which he was treated with a prednisone taper and a mild episode of CHF after fluid resuscitation and also C. diff. colitis for which he was treated with Flagyl. Per reports, he had been doing well at [**Hospital1 **] but had remained on 4 liters nasal cannula since his recent discharge from [**Hospital1 **]. He has had mild increased coughing and sputum production and actually had been ambulating with PT and taking good PO's. On the day of admission, he developed some mild lightheadedness and was noted to have hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 60's to 70's, not responsive to 1500 cc of IV fluid. He was given vancomycin, gentamicin and Bactrim at [**Hospital1 **] and then transferred to the Emergency Department. In the Emergency Department, the patient was afebrile. The blood pressure was 78/40 with an initial lactate of 4.8 and he was then treated per sepsis protocol. He received an additional three liters of IV fluids, received Decadron and also added clindamycin. An IJ was placed with CVP initially at 215 and a mixed venous O2 sat monitor was placed and were showing sats in the mid 70's. He was placed on 100 percent nonrebreather with saturations at 91 percent on 6 liters and he was stable and transferred to the ICU. Currently, he denies any shortness of breath other than notes some mild productive cough with some green sputum. He also notes some pleuritic chest pain. He has no abdominal pain, diarrhea or dysuria.
[**Age over 90 **] yo Russain speaking M with history of CAD s/p CABG, COPD, CHF (EF 30-35%) and recent MICU admission for PNA, sepsis requiring intubation, now presenting with SOB, tachypnea, temperature to 102F with desaturation to 79% on room air.  His saturation improved to 97% with a non rebreather and he was then transferred to the ED from NH.  Per pt's son, [**Name (NI) **], the pt has been more SOB and not tolerating po's over the past 2 days at [**Hospital3 2520**].  He was recently admitted [**2525-5-28**] for aspiration PNA and sepsis requiring intubation. He failed swallow study at that time but was d/c'd to rehab reportedly tolerating po's.  In the ED, the pt was febrile to 102F and given lasix 20mg iv x 1 for slight CHF on CXR. ABG on 70% FM was 7.38/45/60 and BP was borderline low.  The patient was started on ceftriaxone, flagyl and azithromycin.  He was admitted to the unit for close monitoring of blood pressure and pulmonary function.

He also had a head CT w/o contrast to r/o ICH, edema, mass - this showed residual hypodensity on the R subdural region. U/A negative, EKG normal. He was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for further management.
HPI: 81M w/recent subdural hematoma s/p evacuation in [**3-23**], CHF, Afib, aortic aneurysm, recently ([**4-22**]) admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for altered mental status and hypoxia ([**3385-5-4**]) found to have RML MRSA PNA plus CHF with intubation. Sent to ED for evaluation for somnolence, and apnea from [**Hospital1 593**] at [**Location (un) 55**]. This am pt's RR fluctuated from 24/min to periods of 30-40 sec apneic episodes with O2 sats ranging from 88-94% on RA.  In the ED, found to be somnolent but arouseable and able to eat and answer questions.  Weight is stable at 126 lbs on lasix 40 mg PO daily. His Vancomycin course is due to end [**5-20**].  Dose is 500 mg IV q24h due to high troughs.  In ED afebrile, BP 110/70 P 80 O2 97% RA. . Also in his hospitalization in [**3-23**] at [**Hospital1 18**] he was found to have an Enterobacter UTI and a LLL pneumonia (treated with Levoflox). . Pt denies any complaints at this time. Endorses feeling confused this morning and reports that sometimes he "loses days" and that bothers him. . ROS: Denies CP, SOB, orthop, PND, palpitations, cough, fevers, new weaknesses, changes in sensation or vision, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, hematuria, dysuria, blood in the stools.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 15028**] is a 40 year old man with AIDS (criteria of CD-4 counts and opportunistic infections) who is being admitted for dyspnea, fevers, and hypoxia. Mr. [**Known patient lastname 15028**] says that he was in his usual state of (chronically poor) health until about 3 days ago when he began to have more fatigue than usual. He then began to have fevers up to 99.0-100.0 and yesterday started to develop left sided chest pain that came on with deep breaths and coughing, and fevers up to 103 degrees with chills but no rigors. He is coughing up scant, thick yellow sputum, without any blood in the sputum. He came to the Infectious Disease Outpatient Clinic this morning and was found to have a temp of 102 degrees, and an oxygen saturation after walking down the hallway that was 71.%. He was brought to the Emergency Room and admitted from there. He was last hospitalized here from [**6-22**] -> [**2916-6-29**] for persistent pain from a right-sided kidney stone. During the hospital- ization, he had a stent placed into the right kidney to help remove the stone. The stent was removed prior to his discharge. A chest X ray during that admission revealed a faint opacity in the left lower lobe that obscured the left hemidiaphragm on the lateral view. He was, therefore, put on cefpodixime for 7 days." In ER VSS were temp of 101.7 HR of 99 BP 112/72  R24, 74% on RA, 99% on 2L.  Cxray notable for LLL infiltrate. EKG notable for sinus tach at 92, negative axis, R wave transition in v3, flat T waves V5-V6, q3T3, q in [**12-24**]/avf (no change from baseline). INR was 0.9. Cr of 1.6. Blood cultures were sent. In ed received tylenol, ceftriaxone 2mg iv, MS contin and heparin IV. 40 M w/AIDS (CD4 count of 9 on [**2916-4-16**]) admitted [**8-20**] for dyspnea, fevers to 103, and hypoxia. (In [**Hospital **] clinic with temperature of 102 degrees and ambulatory o2 sat of 71%. Please see ID admit note in OMR for complete HPI/history.) In short, patient was in his usual state of health until three days prior to admission when he experienced more fatigue, fevers up to 99.0-100.0, pleuritic chest pain and cough. (Patient was last hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**6-22**] to [**2916-6-29**] for persistent pain from a right-sided kidney stone, a stent was placed and removed.) In ER on admission: VSS were temp of 101.7 HR of 99 BP 112/72 R24, 74% on RA, 99% on 2L. Chest xray was notable for LLL infiltrate. EKG notable for sinus tach at 92, negative axis, R wave transition in v3, flat T waves V5-V6, q3T3, q in [**12-24**]/avf (no change from baseline). INR was 0.9. Cr of 1.6. In the ed the patient received tylenol, ceftriaxone 2mg IV, MS contin and heparin IV. ROS: Man with HIV/AIDS last CD4 count of 9.  On transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] patient continues to express sharp chest pain in left sternal area radiating to left shoulder [**4-30**] in intensity worse with inspiration, patient also reports not some SOB. Patient reports intermittent hematuria. He denies abdominal pain, diarrhea, melena, headache, sore throat, dysuria, lower extremity swelling or pain, orthopnea.
[**Age over 90 **] y.o. female, lives at home, d/c'd from rehab 5 days ago, with pmh of afib on coumadin, CHF (EF 35%), rectal cancer s/p resection in [**2536**], presents BRBPR x 10 days, along with R arm bruising and L buttock bruising. Per patient, it began at rehab. VNA stopped coumadin 2 days ago per the daughter. When her daughter found out she had been bleeding she was brought to ED. Of note, had recent admissions in [**11-17**] for appendicitis with abscess and in [**12-17**] for RLL pneumonia, and was at rehab until 5 days ago after the PNA admission. She denies abdominal pain, chest pain, and has baseline shortness of breath which is unchanged. She feels tired but otherwise has no complaints. . In the ED, vital signs were stable. Her INR was 6.4. Hct 23.5, slightly below basline of 26-28. Troponin 0.07 is at baseline and ECG unchanged from prior. She was given Vitamin K 10mg IV x1, 2 units FFP with 20mg IV lasix inbetween, IV protonix 40mg x1, and was ordered for 2 units PRBCs which were begun in the ICU. She was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring. Upon arrival to the ICU, her VS were stable (BP 130/80, HR 100), and she had a medium maroon stool.
55 year old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (multiple PCI including RCA [**2832**], OM1 [**2834**], LCX [**2834**], LAD [**2837**]), bicuspid aortic valve and moderate aortic stenosis (TTE [**2837**] [**Location (un) 108**] 0.8-1.0cm2, cath [**2837**] gradient 29mm Hg and calculated [**Location (un) 108**] of 1.33 cm2), and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not on coumadin due to bleeding risk, who presents from home following syncopal episode. He reports, when leaving a friend's house and walking to his car in the cold he developed sudden onset substernal chest pain radiating to shoulder and left arm. He drove home, 45 minutes away, and the chest pressure persisted. He noticed that when he got home he felt very weak trying to get a grocery bag out of his car. The chest pain intensified as he walked from his car to the house. At his house, he did not have enough energy to make it up the stairs into his apartment on the [**Location (un) 1752**]. He felt lightheaded and nauseous. He sat down on the third step of the stairs and then lost consciousness and postural tone. He feels that he was down for 10 minutes. After the event he felt "out of it," weak, and had difficulty calling EMS for assistance. He continued to have chest pain. EMS arrived and he was given aspirin 325mg and EKG showed Afib w/ RVR w/ rate of 150s, so was given 20 IV diltiazem with improvement initially of rate to 120s.  He notes that his angina (0.5 miles) and syncopal episodes have increased in frequency over the past few months.  He also notes that he has never had syncope at rest, and that is always with exertion and associated with feeling fatigue and weakness prior. He is now being referred to cardiac surgery for evaluation on Aortic valve replacement.
Mr. [**Known patient firstname **] [**Known patient lastname 3265**] is a 40 year-old man with a past medical history of greater then two month of lower extremity swelling and chronic shortness of breath for which he has not received medical attention who presented to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Room on [**3-10**] with progressive increasing shortness of breath with exertion over time and marked weight gain greater then 50 pounds in the months prior to admission.  The patient denied any specific trigger for worsening weight gain.  Review of systems was significant, however, for snoring, question of some apnea at night.  The patient does sleep during the day.  He denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea or chest pain.  He does state that he has a "mild cough" for two months that is nonproductive.  He does have dyspnea on exertion after one block whereas at baseline approximately on year ago he was able to walk extended periods of time for extended distances without similar discomfort.  The patient does states that he has had nocturia approximately once per night, but this was continued for some time.  The patient also states he had some subjective fevers or chills, but it did not measure his temperature at home. In the Emergency Room the patient's pulse oxygenation was noted to be 70% on room air, which went to 99% on 12 liters by nasal cannula and arterial blood gas was a pH of 7.28, PCO2 78, PO2 176.  A chest x-ray showed mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  In the Emergency Department the patient was diuresed with Lasix times 700 cc after receiving 20 mg of intravenous Lasix.  At that time the patient was refusing a Foley.  Additionally, the patient does endorse drinking three to four drinks of hard alcohol a week having previously had five to six drinks a night of alcohol approximately one year ago.  He has also been taking in unknown over the counter diet drug.

hpi: 90 M with a h/o CHF, CRI, CAD who was found unresponsive at home and in agonal breathing.  Per the daughter he was normal one moment then started clenching jaw, clutching left arm and not responding.  The family immediately called EMS.  Of note he has had a cough and upper respiratory symptoms for three days per family report.  He has had no GI symptoms however he had some diarrhea after arrival to the ED.  He has been having a steady decline in mental status and functioning for the last several months for which he has been evaluated extensively by his primary care doctor. On arrival to the ED he was immediately intubated.  VBG on arrival pH 7.09 and K 8.0, glucose 157, lactate 4.1.  Pt had EKG changes consistent with hyperkalemia and was given calcium gluconate, D50, insulin.  Repeat K 4.6.  Also given vancomyin 1 gm IV and levoquin 500 mg IV x1 empirically for sepsis of unknown source.  He had episode of hypotension to SBP's 70 responding to 1L NS but otherwise has not required pressors.  CT scan head without ICH, CT abd poor study but no free air or peritonitis.  Abdominal U/S with no cholecystitis.  Seen by cardiology for NSTEMI and felt that not candidate for cath. Aspirin given but asked to defer heparin gtt as he was guiaic positive.
The patient is a 71-year-old male who had underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x3 on [**3273-3-31**]. The patient noticed new sternal wound drainage with a cough on [**3273-5-6**]. The patient denied any fevers, chills, sweats, anorexia or dry heaves.  The patient, however, did have a temperature of 102?????? when he presented to the [**Hospital 1456**] Hospital Emergency Room on the [**10-9**].  Blood glucoses had ranged around 130s at home.  The patient's recovery from his coronary artery bypass graft had been otherwise unremarkable.

77 year old male with multiple medical problems, pertinently including coronary artery disease status post CABG with CHF and EF 30-35% as of [**3273**], hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency, who is transferred from [**Hospital 1456**] Hospital after an admission for pancreatitis complicated by pseudomonal UTI, asystolic cardiac arrest, and respiratory failure. The patient actually had a prior hospitalization in [**Month (only) 946**] of [**3279**] when he presented with epigastric pain and was found to have "abnormal liver function tests." Ultrasound demonstrated a hepatic mass, confirmed by CT scan. MRI, demonstrated a 5.5 x 5.6 cm lesion in the posterior segment of the right lobe of the liver, however it did not enhance and seemed more consistent with focal fatty infiltration. His AFP level was normal, but CA [**91**]-9 was elevated at 260. His hepatitis serologies were negative. It is unclear what happened subsequently, however he represented to [**Hospital 1456**] Hospital on [**5-2**], again complaining of abdominal pain radiating to the back, with nausea and vomiting. He was found to have elevated amylase and lipase (1324, and 3500 respectively), consistent with pancreatitis. Total bili was 2.6, with a direct fraction of 1.9. ALP 466, GGT 810, AST 210, ALT 170. A repeat CT scan again demonstrated a heterogeneous 5 cm mass in the liver, as well as multiple gallstones. He was seen by GI who felt that the picture was most consistent with gallstone pancreatitis, however given the extent of alkaline phosphatase elevation, with only minimal bilirubin elevation, and the intrahepatic mass, they suggested ERCP, with possible liver biopsy as well, for further workup. While there, however, he developed respiratory distress on the floor and was transferrred to the ICU where he desaturated and had an asystolic arrest. He was intubated, and received 2 rounds of epinephrine and atropine with 2 minutes of CPR. He regained a rhythm, which reportedly was an SVT. He required pressors for a period of time, and had a hematocrit drop requiring multiple units of PRBCs. He was felt to have mucous plugged, and had a bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] which demonstrated rective bronchial cells, histiocytes, and neutrophils, but had no growth on cultures. He was weaned off of pressors and extubated on [**5-10**], however failed, thought secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to CHF, and ended up getting reintubated on [**5-14**]. After diuresis they were in the process of performing an SBT, however he self-extubated on [**5-16**]. He was placed on 100% nonrebreather, and ultimately required non-invasive positive pressure ventilation on the day of transfer, though we have no ABGs. His chest x-ray on [**5-16**] demonstrated enlarged heart with worsening pulmonary edema, as well as left lower lobe consolidation and pleural effusion. He failed a speech and swallow test, raising concern for aspiration pneumonia. His hospital course was otherwise complicated by rising BUN and creatinine, for which a renal consult was called. His BUN seemed to be rising out of proportion to creatinine (BUN 102, creatining 1.9, up from 36 and 1.4, respectively, on [**5-7**]), raising the question of GI bleeding, versus a pre-renal azotemia from aggressive diuresis. The decline in renal function also seems to have been after his cardiac arrest, therefore hypotension could have contributed as well.
62yo woman with a history of HTN, CHF, UC, who presented with fatigue/malaise and was found to have hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia.  Five days prior to presentation, the patient began feeling extremely fatigued & tired.  She reported a constellation of associated symptoms, including frontal HA, b/l leg discomfort, nausea w/ occasional post-prandial emesis, and ? increased LE swelling.  She noted that, prior to these symptoms, she was exposed to her grandkids, who have had a viral-like illness.  She noted a decreased appetite & PO intake for several days prior to presentation. During this period, she has continued on her lasix & HCTZ.  She denies recent ETOH. In the ED, VSS.  MS reportedly clear.  No sz.  Na 116 & K 2.0. Pt started on normal saline 100cc/hr w/ KCL.  She was also given 60meq KCL PO.  She was admitted to the MICU for treatment of her electrolyte abnormalities.
Pt is a 62 year-old W with PMH of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, diastolic dysfunction, tricuspid regurgitation/ mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and alcohol abuse, transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 614**] with dyspnea on exertion. . At [**Location (un) 614**], patient was diuresed with IV Lasix and Aldactone. She was diagnosed with acute renal failure, her electrolytes were abnormal, the aldactone and lasix discontinued, and she was given Kayexalate and Magnesium. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. . During admission, patient developed hematemesis. NG tube was placed. Red blood was lavaged. GI was consulted and patient was transferred to CCU for urgent scope. In the CCU, urgent scope revealed large ulceration in the duodenal bulb with adherent clot. GI injected epinephrine and cauterized visible vessel. . Pt's VS were stable throughout procedure and stat HCT on arrival to CCU was unchanged.
62 y/o F with PMHx of biventricular heart failure and pulm hypertension presents with hypoxia and pleuritic chest pain. Pt first developed cough with sputum production 2 weeks prior to admission. She was treated with Azithromycin for 5 days and had some initial improvement in symptoms. However, after completing the course, she began to have worsening cough, DOE and developped a pleuritic chest pain. The chest pain began on her left side while lying down 3 nights ago. She denies CP with exertion, symptoms seem to come on when lying down. She denies any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or [**Month (only) **] po intake. She has significant DOE and some increase in ankle edema. Orthopnea is at baseline of 3 pillows and denies PND. She was being seen in clinic on thursday morning and was sent to ED for O2 sats in the 80s and tachypnea. . VS on arrival to ED: 96.6 72 128/62 18 87 %on RA. Pt underwent CTA that was negative for PE but showed small to moderate right sided pleural effusion and R basilar atelectasis. EKGs were essentially unchanged from prior with non-specific ST-T wave changes. Pt received Lasix 40mg IV, Aspirin 325mg, Levofloxacin 750mg and combivent nebs. on arrival to floor, pt was feeling comfortable at rest but reports DOE with minimal exertion. . ROS on admission: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria. On the floor, a right sided diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis was done. Within minutes, she became hypoxic and had hemoptysis. She remained hemodynamically stable throughout, however a code blue was called for emergent intubation. She was transferred to the MICU for intubation and bronchoscopy, with possible endobronchial blockade.
62 year old woman with pmh significant for dilated right sided systolic heart failure and diastolic left sided heart failure, presenting with hypoxia and hypotension in the setting of diarrhea. The patient states for 3 days prior to her ICU admission she had diarrhea and extreme fatigue and DOE. She was only able to walk a few steps prior to stopping. Normally she can walk a [**1-7**] flight of stairs prior to stopping due to fatigue and DOE but in total able to walk up 2 flights of stairs. She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] and rehydrated, it was thought that her cardiac index was low due to her dehydration and than she now had a significant shunt through a large PFO (based on + bubble then TEE) which was worsening her oxygenation. Her blood pressure was improved with IVF and dopamine and renal was consulted for her renal failure who thought it was secondary to her low cardiac output state. She has been feeling slightly better over the past few days however still very fatigued and has not walked so is unable to give a history in regards to DOE. She has stable [**2-8**] pillow orthopnea now and prior to admission, no PND. She has noticed an increase in her lower extremity edema since admission. Her diarrhea has stopped. No chest pain. No LH or syncope, no F/C/NS or any other complaints. . She was transferred from the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] to the [**Hospital1 1498**] service for a R heart cath to [**Hospital1 4592**] the effect of NO on reducing PVR to see if PFO closure would be helpful.
Ms [**Known patient lastname 13298**] is a 63 yo F with h/o severe diastolic heart failure (EF 55%) w/ RV failure, severe TR, AF (not on coumadin due to GIB), PFO closure ([**4-14**]). ulcerative colitis, HTN and pulmonary hypertension who presented to Dr.[**Name (NI) 3487**] office today with complaints of increasing SOB, and inability to walk due to leg edema for the past month. She has noted a 45 lbs. weight gain and admits to med non-compliance with torsemide. On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cough. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. (+) Loose dark stools (not black/tarry) and has seen a small amount of blood mixed w/ stool and in toilet paper. All of the other review of systems were negative. Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. (+) 3 pillow orthopnea.
63yof w h/o severe diastolic CHF, pulmonary HTN, afib, possible ulcerative colitis, recent LGIB, prior h/o bleeding duodenal ulcers presented 3 days ago from an outpatient renal appointment with a HCT of 17 and a creatinine of 3.  She has a history of chronic anemia likely [**2-7**] CKD and chronic inflammation, with baseline HCT of 22-25.  She previously had a baseline creatinine of ~1.5 but bumped up to a new baseline of ~2-2.5 since having acute decompensated diastolic heart failure 3 months ago.  She was previously admitted last month for hematochezia with a HCT=19, and was found to have bleeding colonic angioectasias that were cauterized on colonoscopy.  She also has a history of recurrent UGIB from duodenal ulcers, though her most recent EGD during the last admission was normal.  Per pt, she had been having diarrhea for ~2 wks before admission (2 loose BMs/day), with some red blood in the stool (denies melena).  She also had some nausea and vomiting 1-2 days prior to admission, with small blood in her very last episode of emesis.  She had also fallen 2 days prior to admission due to tripping on her nightgown as she was getting undressed, with resulting bruises and bilateral leg pain that she self-treated with oxycodone. . In ED, initial VS= 97.8 60 109/52 16 96%/RA.  On exam she was clinically fluid overloaded and guiac+ with melenic stool.  NG lavage was negative.  Coags were normal.  +Eos in her urine. She was made NPO, given Protonix 40 mg IV x1, transfused 2U pRBCs, and admitted to the MICU. . In the MICU, she was lethargic and complained of leg, low back, and arm pain.  She was hypotensive with SBP in the 80s and was started on pressors.  HCT initially did not bump with transfusion, so CT of torso and lower extremities was obtained, showing no retroperitoneal bleed or significant hematoma.  Pt received an additional 4U pRBCs, with HCT stabilizing at ~23. Her BP improved but dropped back to the 80s with morphine 0.5 mg for pain, requiring her to transiently be back on pressors.  She had one BM yesterday that she did not look at.  She did not have vomiting.  She was not scoped in the MICU as apparently she needs to be intubated for this (unclear why). NG lavage today revealed no blood, and pt was started on a clear diet and transferred to the floor. . Currently, pt complains of leg, low back, and arm pain.  She denies nausea or abdominal pain. . Review of systems: (+) Spontaneous nosebleeds x past 2 weeks, up to several per day.  DOE (including walking on level ground).  Gained ~50 lbs over past 2 yrs (was 135 lbs previously).  Has palpitations likely from afib.  Has intermitent dry cough.  Has wheezing/SOB that she attributes to heart failure, but for some reason she takes albuterol for this.  Thinks her skin has been getting diffusely darker recently. (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent URI symptoms, chest pain, dysuria, rash.
63 y/o F with hx of severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower GI bleed who is transferred from [**Hospital1 1753**] with acute dyspnea and hypoxia.  Per her daughter, she has been more dypsneic on exertion for the past week with episodes somewhat relieved with albuterol.  The pt reports that she awoke at 3:15 AM with acute shortness of breath and wheezing.  She denies chest pain, palpitations, fevers, chills, night sweats.  She denies cough.  An albuterol inhaler did not help, so she went to the [**Hospital1 1753**] ED. . In the [**Hospital1 1753**] ED, she placed on bipap with O2sat 100%.  Her BP was initially 104/67, HR 55, RR13.  CXR showed R pleural effusion.  BNP was 1500, cardiac enzymes negative.  HCT was noted to be 24.9 (baseline 24-27).  At 6am her blood pressures dropped to 83/44 and she was given a 125cc NS bolus.  ABG on bipap was 7.34/60/313/32.  At 7:30am, Levophed gtt was started. At 8am she was transitioned to a NRB and was satting 100%.  Her levophed was increased at 8:15am. . On arrival to the ICU, she reports comfortable breathing ever since being placed on O2.  ROS is otherwise positive for more black stools over the past 2-3 days. . Of note, she was recently admitted [**Date range (3) 13299**] due to lower GI bleed and HCT of 17.  She required 6 units PRBCs that admission and bleeding was felt to be due to lower GI angioectasia; colonoscopy was not done due to recent scope [**2-15**] which showed many angioectasias throughout the colon.  HCT was stable at 24.7 on discharge and most recent HCT [**4-11**] was 27.4. She was also treated for congestive heart failure exacerbation and acute renal failure on that admission and was discharged on spironolactone, torsemide and metolazone still about 40 lbs above her dry weight.  At her follow-up appointments, her weight was still stable, so spironolactone was increased on [**3-31**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 117**] (weight 199 lbs) and her torsemide on [**4-3**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 432**] (weight 196 lbs). The pt reports medication compliance (does sometimes take medications late) and general diet compliance although "ate more over [**Holiday **]."

The patient is a 65 year old female with a past medical history of longstanding right heart failure with severe right ventricular contractile dysfunction and severe tricuspid regurgitation, atrial fibrillation not on warfarin due to GI bleed in [**2861**] but no known history of coronary artery disease who presents from home with several weeks of progressively worsening lower extremity edema and fatigue. . She has longstanding right sided heart failure, which in the past has been refractory to  diuresis and during a previous admission in [**2861-4-6**] required ultrafiltration due to poor response to IV diuresis. At the time, she was diagnosed with a PFO and left-to-right shunting that was percutaneously closed on [**2861-3-30**].  Her most recent RHC was on [**2861-4-8**] and showed no shunt, RAP 30 mmHg, mean PAP 38 mmHg, and wedge pressure 30 mmHg.  At the time, ultrafiltation resulted in improved forward flow and improvement in renal function.  CT chest in the past was negative for thromboemboli. . She appears to have been fairly well compensated over the past 18 months, on medical therapy (torsemide 40mg [**Hospital1 **], metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **], spironolactone 25mg daily) without hospitalization. However, over the last 2-3 weeks, she has noted significantly worsening lower extremity edema (legs doubling in size), fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and poor urine output, despite minimal diet changes and medication compliance. She reports mechanical fall this past Friday landing on her right side (knee, shoulder). Following this she took 4 tablets of ibuprofen. Reports dry weight in 140lb range, currently 185lbs. .

This is a 65 year old woman with severe LV diastolic dysfunction, severe TR, and RV failure often refractory to diuretics and has previously required CVVH/UF, CRI (baseline Cr 2.5), HTN, DM, and Afib, and ulcerative colitis who is transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 **] with acute appendicitis and congestive heart failure. Please see the CCU fellows note for details. In brief, the patient presented with right-sided abdominal pain x 3-4 days when she presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2864-3-17**]. She denied any nausea of vomiting or change in bowel movements at initial presentation. She underwent an abdominal CT which demonstrated a 10m enlarged appendix with phlegmon and fat stranding. She was not taken to the OR because of her comorbiditis and there was no obvious pocket to drain. She was medically managed with Cipro/Flagyl. It is not clear how much IVF she received- but per OSH records, she was given 'discretionary use' of IVF. She was also started on diuretic (unclear the dose)and and her response to diuretics is not clear. The patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further surgerical evaluation of her phlegmon. She was transferred on neosynephrine. . Initial labs revealed a severe metabolic acidosis with a ABG of 7.19/42/101, a HCO3 of 15, an anion gap of 23, and a Lactate of 1.2. She was 15kg over her dry weight (81.4kg on arrival with a dry weight off 66). The patient is drowsy with providing limited additional details or history. She denies CP but feels somewhat short of breath and unable to lie flat. She denies abdominal pain. . Limit review of systems, given patient mental status.

History is limited as patient is poor historian and somnolent at times. She denies any recent travel, new medications except prednisone which was started approx. 5 days ago for R great toe pain. In the ED, initial VS: 97.9 102 83/59 18 99% RA. Exam notable for bruising over extremities and flank, non focal neuro exam, DRE with guaiac positive brown stool. CXR showed no evidence of PNA. UA showed trace leuks, 2 WBC, no bacteria or nitrites. She was given 3L NS with no change in BP but lactate improved from 2.2 to 1.2. SBP was in the 40s at one point and a R IJ CVL was placed under sterile conditions. She was started on norepinephrine with minimal improvement in BP despite maxing out. Dopamine was added and she was extremely responsive to dopamine, with improvement in MAPs immediately. She was given hydrocortisone 100mg IV x1 for stress dose steroids. She was also given Zosyn and Vancomycin IV empirically given bandemia and overall instability. CT abdomen/pelvis without PO or IV contrast showed no clear cause for leukocytosis. On arrival to the MICU, she complains of pain throughout her body. Review of systems:  (+) Per HPI, otherwise negative.
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 13338**] is a 44 year old female with significant CAD status post multiple stents and CABG at age 34 who presented to [**Doctor First Name **] OSH with 1 week of cough, dyspnea status post a Z pack, then subsequently erythromcyin, now with worsening SOB and abdominal pain. Transferred from outside hospital with decreased O2 Sats and hypotension. . In ED, EKG w/ NSR, LBBB, q III (old), ST dep I (old). CXR at that time was consistent with mild CHF. Her CK was 3277, Trop 0.02. Cr 4.5 (new, baseline 0.9). A CT of the abdomen was negative for obstruction. No inflammatory changes. Unchanged from [**3222**]. Foley cath shows 400cc yellow-brown urine output. She had a recurrent episode of hypotension to 80's systolic, otherwise asymptomatic at 1100, improved to 100's systolic after 250ccNS. Given hypotension/leukocytosis/cough, she was given levofloxacin 250mg x 1 (after 2 sets of Blood cultures, and urine culture sent). She was subsequently noted to be increasingly somnolent/fatigued. Her ABG demonstrated hypercarbic respiratory failure, with pH 7.08, pCO2 84, pO2 84. Tox screen positive for cocaine and opiods. . From the ED, she was transferred to the MICU for respiratory failure secondary to CHF/COPD Exacerbation, pneumonia, and possibly opioid toxicity. She was intubated due to somnolence and rising CO2 on BiPAP, treated with nebs, steroids, levofloxacin, and was eventually weaned off on [**10-2**]. She no longer required oxygen upon transfer to the floor.
This is a 44 y/o female with CAD s/p multiple stents, s/p CABG at age 34, who was recently at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 13340**] for hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation and ARF thought to be [**1-14**] rhabdo and hypovolemia, who now p/w hypoxia, lethargy, and acute renal failure. Per report, she was found by her sister to be unresponsive today at home, and per son who saw her this morning, thought she was just "sleeping" but difficult to arouse. Her sister last talked to the patient yesterday evening around 6pm. Per history, pt was c/o of worsening back pain. It is unknown how long patient was down. [**Name (NI) 1080**] sister called EMS and pt was brought into the ED. Pt was noted by EMS to be cyanotic and no O2 sats were obtainable. . In the ED, VS were Tc 98.8, BP 138/77, HR 100, RR 28, SaO2 100%/NRB, AO x 1. Labs were significant for an ABG 7.01/77/113 on a NRB, K of 8.0 initially, Cr of 6.0. Phos was also markedly elevated at 16.7. She was given a dose of narcan and awoke marginally, but was still somnolent. For hyperkalemia, she was given 1 amp calcium gluconate, insulin 10 units IV, 1 amp of D50, 60 mg of kayexalate, and 1 amp of bicarb. She was afebrile, but given an elevated WBC of 19, was pan-cultured and given one dose of Levofloxacin. During her course, her SBP's dropped to the 60's-70's systolic and she was given a total of 5 L NS with response of SBPs to 110's. She was also started on a bicarb gtt given the metabolic acidosis. She was tried on BiPAP initially for a hypercapnia, however patient did not tolerate and was subsequently intubated. Post-intubation, she was hypotensive to 70's and was started on dopamine transiently, now weaned off. She is currently receiving her 6th L of NS, with 7th L hanging. Continues on bicarb gtt. Serum tox was negative, urine tox not obtainable at that time as pt was anuric in ED. . From the ED, she was transferred to the MICU for respiratory failure and ARF. Pt is currently sedated and intubated.

40M with history of CAD s/p cath [**12-8**], DM2, hypertension, multinodular goiter with microcalcifications, ulcerative colitis status post colectomy with permanent ileostomy, presents with atypical chest pain.  He was discharged on [**12-9**] for admission for positive stress test, found to have 50% LAD stenosis which was not intervened on given poor medical compliance, started on high dose statin and discharged.  He presents again today with chest pain, however he declines to give a history.  Per PCP call in, pt stated "I want to blow myself up"  "Put myself in front of a car to be run over" and "My mind is just too full, too chaotic, just want it to stop."  States the "it" he wants to stop is his medical       difficulties.  Patient also states that he wants to "blow us all up" pointing to the doctor, myself and his mother in the room with him, and using his hand in what looks like pressing detonator of an       explosive.  [**Name (NI) 1080**] mother states he talks like this when he is at medical appointment, but at home is calm and notin danger.  He was sent to ED for psych evaluation and for evaluation of chest pain.  No abd pain, vomiting, diarrhea. . In the ED, initial VS were: 98.1 99 160/90 20 99%.  EKG with sinus tach to 103, LVH, nl axis, and TWI in I, aVL, V4, V6.  ABG was done for question of altered mental status which showed pH 7.29, pCO2 38, pO2 36, HCO3 19, non-gap.  Stox and Utox negative.  Given kayexalate 60 gm x 1 for K of 5.7.  Als received ceftriaxone and dexamethasone.  CXR with changse c/w CHF.  Cardiology fellow called, felt that he is not a candidate for stenting given his likely noncompliance with medication.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman who was admitted for placement of bilateral common iliac artery stents for peripheral vascular disease for nonhealing toe ulcer on [**3-3**] and thrombin injection for left common femoral pseudoaneurysm. She was s/p op day 2 and was to be discharged when she developed the sudden onset of shortness of breath. Her BP was 190/90 and O2 sat 68% on 4 L NC she went up to 72%. An arterial blood gas obtained showed 7.28/47/51. She was started on a nitro drip and lasix IV. She had rales all the way up and upon emergent intubation, froth was visualized in ET tube.
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a long history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmias, who found down in her home by her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] the outside hospital records, the husband noticed mental status changes for approximately two weeks and occasional dyspnea.  It was not known at the time she was admitted, but later it was learned that the patient had been taking Aldactone starting approximately two weeks ago at the time that her mental status changes began to occur.  The patient was found on the floor outside of her bathroom, apparently just after she stood from the toilet. She was brought to the Emergency Room with a systolic blood pressure of 80, with no response to 2 liters of fluid in the Emergency Room.  She was found to have a potassium of 6.9, a BUN 53, and creatinine 2.9; although, her baseline is a creatinine of 1.  She was noted to have  wide complex QRS on her electrocardiogram, was mildly obtunded, and was placed on dopamine at 4.5 mcg/min for pressure support.  Her right upper quadrant was noted to be painful on physical examination.  Laboratories there were notable for a bicarbonate of 18, flat creatine kinases, and elevated digoxin level at 2.5, an INR greater than 7.5, and a hematocrit of 29.  A head CT was performed to rule out cerebrovascular accident.  This was limited by artifact, but was negative for acute processes.  A rushed echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 25%.  At the outside hospital she was given D-50 and insulin times two, and Kayexalate p.o. and p.r. for her hyperkalemia, as well as 2 units of packed red blood cells for a slightly low hematocrit of 29.7, and 2 units fresh frozen plasma, as well as vitamin K for her elevated INR, then transferred to [**Hospital1 1426**]. Upon arrival, the patient complains of right upper quadrant pain on and off which lasts five minutes at a time, is dull, is rated [**6-2**] in intensity, and possibly occurs more often after meals.  She reports that Tylenol helps this pain.  She also complains of diarrhea times one month, ultimately loose and watery, as well as specks of bright red blood in her stool, but no melena, hematemesis, nausea or vomiting.  She does report a slight decrease in her appetite and p.o. intake, but does report food fluid intake and increased thirst.  She thinks she may have increased her intake of salty foods recently.  She has been Imodium for her diarrhea. The rest of her review of systems was remarkable for the absence of chest pain and palpitations, the presence of shortness of breath for approximately three weeks, three-pillow orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea two weeks ago, and increased lower extremity edema for several weeks.  She has had no change in her weight but has not checked this precisely.  She denies fevers, chills, and night sweats, rash, genitourinary complaints. Regarding her fall, she has recollection of the actual event, but says that she probably lost consciousness.  She reports leg pain prior to the event, and is unable to clarify clearly beyond saying that they were weak (left greater than right).
A 58-year-old female with a past medical history of severe coronary artery disease complicated by myocardial infarction, status post stenting, coronary artery bypass graft times two, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, status post ablation and cardioversion, pacemaker placement, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than 20%, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and mitral valve replacement, who presented to [**Hospital3 1265**] Hospital status post a fall secondary to instability.  The patient was found to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s to 80s.  This was complicated by acute renal failure and an elevated digoxin level.  In addition, the patient also had a low hematocrit in the setting of an elevated INR. The patient had a similar episode on her last admission to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2670-8-10**]; admitted with hypotension and an elevated INR for which she received dopamine and fresh frozen plasma/vitamin K with good result.  She has had increasing edema and ascites since this last admission that has been resistant to outpatient diuretic treatment.  The patient has gained about 30 pounds since last admission. For the two months prior to admission, the patient has been experiencing worsening leg weakness. On the a.m. of admission the patient began experiencing lightheadedness.  On the afternoon of admission the patient was walking in her house and began losing her balance secondary to leg weakness, per patient.  She fell without loss of consciousness.  She denied headache, fever, chills, sweats, dizziness, "blacking out," change in vision or chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, incontinence, and diaphoresis at the time of the fall.  The fall was complicated by a 1-inch laceration on the back of her head. She was able to crawl to a cell phone and call a girlfriend who called an ambulance. The patient arrive via ambulance to [**Hospital3 1265**] Hospital where she received 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma, 1 liter of normal saline, and dopamine at 8 mcg per minute, as well as suturing of the laceration prior to her transfer to [**Hospital1 341**]. At [**Hospital1 69**], the patient still denied headache, fevers, chills, sweats, dizziness, change in vision, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and diaphoresis.  At baseline, the patient denies chest pain or palpitations.  She does complain of three-pillow orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and lower extremity edema.
The patient is a 59-year-old female with an extensive cardiac history including coronary artery disease (three vessel) status post coronary artery bypass graft x 3 in [**2665**], re-do in [**2668**], atrial fibrillation status post DDD pacemaker in [**2668**], end stage congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than 20%, hypertension, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, not a candidate for heart transplant, on home dopamine drip and Hospice status, reversed to full code during this admission, initially presenting with chest pain and ruled out for myocardial infarction and now called out of the Coronary Care Unit and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 194**] team for EP evaluation of apparent tachy arrhythmia.  The patient reportedly had tachycardia up to the 170s by EMS in the field, and resolved with 20 mg of intravenous Diltiazem x 1.  During this hospital stay, the patient has had no nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on telemetry.  The patient has only occasional sinus tachycardia and premature ventricular contractions, as well as atrial tachycardia with 2:1 block.  The patient was comfortable and asymptomatic while on the floor.
This is a 60-year-old white female with past medical history of coronary artery disease status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft, saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to D1 and saphenous vein graft to OM1 in [**2665**], re-do in [**2668**], congestive heart failure, with her last ejection fraction less than 20%, likely secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy, mechanical mitral valve replacement, atrial fibrillation (anticoagulated), status post DDD pacemaker in [**2668**], status post pacemaker replacement three weeks ago, hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, complete occlusion of abdominal aorta, chronic renal insufficiency, the patient is chronically on home dopamine therapy since [**2670-10-24**].  The patient was in her usual state of health last seen by the Heart Failure Clinic on [**2672-8-26**], and had been in her usual state of health until Saturday, the 9th.  On Sunday, the 10th, the patient starting developing watery diarrhea and mild cramps.  She was having about three to four episodes of loose stools a day. On the day prior to admission she began feeling lightheaded and dizzy.  On the morning of that day she was found to be hypotensive and confused and found stooling in her bed.  When EMS arrived to her home she was found covered in stool which was heme positive.  Her blood pressure was 50/20.  The patient stated that on the night prior to admission she had felt chills but did not take her temperature.  She denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting. Did not note her stool to have melena or bright red blood per rectum.  In the Emergency Room she was thought to be hypotensive so she was given one and a half liters of fluid and her diuretics were held.  She is on 8 mcg/kg/min of dopamine at home and she was given an additional 15 mcg/kg of dopamine to which her blood pressure responded and went up to the 120's over 70's.  Blood and urine cultures were sent from the Emergency Room.  A chest x-ray was checked and the patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for further [**Year (4 digits) 7846**].
The patient is a 60-year-old white female with a history of congestive heart failure and diabetes who comes in with hypotension, renal failure, and hypercalcemia. The patient was previously admitted in [**2672-9-23**] with a similar complaint and treatment for hypovolemia and found to have Klebsiella, Staphylococcus aureus, [**Female First Name (un) 558**] bacteremia.  Later found to have an elevated INR with guaiac-positive stool.  Her hematocrit had fallen, and the patient was given one unit of packed red blood cells.  The patient went to the Emergency Department but refused to stay. The patient came to the Emergency Department today because of feeling "lightheaded."  Notes having diarrhea today.  Not watery.  Reports being constipated in the past five days. The patient denies melena, hematochezia, nausea, or vomiting. She reports initially feeling lightheaded when standing up which improved with time.  Also started having an increase in bowel movements which were black in color.  The patient denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea.  She has increased swelling in the legs.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is an 82 year old with woman with a history of DMII, HTN, Asthma, OSA, dCHF, peripheral neuropathy who is admitted for AMS and hypercapnea. . Patient was recently admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] [**3340-2-16**], at the time she had presented with AMS, was found to be hypercarbic and requiring intubation, she was noted to have fluid overload and was diuresed with lasix, she did not have evidence of pneumonia, LENIs were negative, and echocardiogram showed a preserved biventricular systolic function without pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, it was felt that her hypercarbia was due to not wearing night time BIPAP for successive days leading to slow increase in her PCO2 +/- central apnea. She did well after extubation and was discharged to rehab with nighttime BiPAP and oral lasix. . Per her daughter at baseline prior to previous hospitalization was wheelchair bound most of the day but could make a few independent steps to the bathroom. Needed help in ADL.

In the Emergency Department, an x-ray of the left lower extremity was obtained which revealed a displaced fracture of the tibia and fibula.  The Orthopaedic Service evaluated the patient in the Emergency Department and planned for an open reduction/internal fixation in the next few days, once her INR was normalized. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 90, her blood pressure was 164/76, her respiratory rate was 20, and her oxygen saturation was 98% on room air.  Generally, she was in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed small bilaterally reactive pupils.  The mucous membranes were moist.  The neck was supple.  There was no jugular venous distention.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  The lungs revealed decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.  The abdomen was obese, soft, and nontender.  There were normal active bowel sounds.  Extremities revealed her left lower extremity was immobilized with some trace edema of her lower extremities.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+ bilaterally.  On neurologic examination cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  She was alert and oriented times three. PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count was 14.8, her hematocrit was 35.2, and her platelets were 325.  Her INR was 4.7.  Sodium was 141, potassium was 4.7, chloride was 109, bicarbonate was 24, blood urea nitrogen was 32, and her creatinine was 2. PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An x-ray of the left lower extremity showed a displaced spiral fracture of the tibia and fibula. SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM: 1.  RESPIRATORY FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient's open reduction/internal fixation was initially delayed secondary to her elevated INR. After correction of her INR, the patient went for open reduction/internal fixation.  This was complicated by some hypotension intraoperatively with induction.  The patient was given multiple liters of intravenous fluids, after which the patient could not be extubated secondary to hypoxemia and hypercarbic respiratory failure; likely secondary to congestive heart failure with aggressive intravenous fluid hydration. The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for a transient 3-day stay, where she was diuresed with Lasix.  The patient's respiratory failure improved markedly. She was extubated and remained on the floor with a chest x-ray showing some resolving atelectasis and pneumonia. The patient ended up having an echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 60% with some evidence of diastolic dysfunction. The patient was continued on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for a left lower lobe infiltrate which improved. 2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was noted to be febrile to 101 in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Her cultures were negative.  She was noted to have a left lower lobe infiltrate and was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin with improvement in her fever curve and documented improvement on chest x-ray. However, once on the floor, the patient continued to spike fevers on ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  Her urinalysis and chest x-ray were both negative.  The patient had a right internal jugular which was subsequently pulled, and blood cultures were pending. 3.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient had significant congestive heart failure postoperatively from aggressive fluid resuscitation in the operating room. The patient had a 3[**Hospital 15188**] Medical Intensive Care Unit stay during which she was diuresed with Lasix and extubated with stable oxygen saturations on the floor. 4.  RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient with a baseline creatinine of 1.3 to 1.6 which peaked to 2.2 postoperatively.
This is a 65-year-old woman with known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary function tests never obtained, admitted to the medical intensive care unit for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and with suspicion of congestive heart failure.  The patient was status post multiple respiratory issues in the past few months secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  In early [**Month (only) 213**] she had had a residual bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, she was status post pneumonia, she was placed on Levaquin and a prednisone taper earlier this month.  In [**2663-5-25**] the patient had a pneumonia requiring Solu-Medrol and a prednisone taper as well as Levaquin.  The patient also has questionable obstructive sleep apnea although there is no record of a sleep study.  The patient has a baseline oxygen requirement of two liters of home O2 as well as BiPAP every night.  The patient was transferred from the medical intensive care unit to the floor because of increased respiratory function, and she was thus ready for weaning off of high-dose steroids as well as for continuation of her pulmonary and cardiac work-up.  There was a question as to whether or not there were EKG changes when the patient presented to the Emergency Department, together with some hypertension.

At home he uses O2 intermittently at a rate of [**2-23**].5 Lt/min. He reports increasing cough, productive of white phlegm and difficulty keeping medications down in past week or so, with desire to throw up after taking his pills that is relieved by taking sips of water. He also reports transient mild traveling pain from his R and L chest down to the R abdomen, as well as pain in his neck and back. The patient denied worsening chest pain accompanying his SOB, denied orthopnea, pleuritic chest pain, fevers, night sweats, dysuria, pain on urination, hematuria, hematochezia; eats a low salt diet, no dietary changes although decreased appetite in past weeks. Denies recent falls. Cardiologist evaluated on [**7-7**] with plan to stop dofetilide and start amiodarone due to ectopy. Dofetilide was stopped and pt has not been able to tolerate amiodarone due to nausea and emesis after ingesting the pill. In the ED, initial VS were 96.9 32 116/76 26 97% 2L Nasal Cannula.

Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 66 year old woman with multiple medical problems including CAD s/p DES to RCA in [**3150-2-4**], severe aortic stenosis (valve area 0.5 cm2), recent DVT treated with coumadin, and SLE who is transferred from [**Hospital3 3534**] CCU for evaluation of severe aortic stenosis earlier this year. . Her cardiac history dates to [**3150-2-4**] for SOB when diagnosed with severe CHF and aortic stenosis. She also underwent a cardiac catherization at [**Hospital1 3228**] during that admission, and had a DES placed to the RCA, which was complicated by acute renal failure in the setting of contrast load. She was deemed to be an inoperable candidate by the cardiac surgeons at [**Hospital1 3228**]. . She then presented to the [**Hospital3 3534**] ED on [**3150-4-29**] after several days of increasing cough productive of sputum, fevers, and worsening SOB. She was admitted to the CCU and treated for a pneumonia with broad spectrum antibiotics,diuresed with lasix gtt and developed acute renal failure (Cre1.9->3.3->2.3)renal thought it was secondary to diuresis versus worsening aortic stenosis and less likely lupus nephritis given negative complement. . During her hospitalization in early [**Month (only) 541**], she was seen in consultation with the [**Hospital1 18**] (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] cardiac surgery service who deemed her an Extreme Risk surgical candidate due to porcelain aorta. Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 902**] later concurred in his findings. . She was re-admitted to [**Hospital3 3534**] on [**3150-5-28**] with worsening of her shortness of breath and suspicion of pneumonia secondary to her immunocompromised status.  She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment of her CHF. . Due to her worsening renal function (creatinine = 3.3 mg/dl), left and right heart diastolic heart failure, and shortness of breath, balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed on [**3150-6-1**] with a 22 mm and 23 mm aortic valvuloplasty balloons without complications.  The final aortic valve area was 0..86 cm2. . Following BAV, she symptoms improved and her creatinine fell to 1.8 mg/dL.  She mobilized over 1 kg of fluid in a 24 hour period. Her dyspnea is substantially improved.  She was discharged to home on daily furosemide. . She was readmitted [**6-19**] for CTA to complete her workup. Her renal function remained stable. . She has continuted to have NYHA Class III symptoms with exertion.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 15302**] is a 60 year old male with a very complicated past medical history. He was recently diagonosed with Enterococcal and Klebsiella bactermia. This was further complicated by Enterococcal mitral valve endocarditis and septic emboli to central nervous system, spleen and lungs. Cardiac surgery was delayed at that time due to increased risk of bleeding secondary to central nervous system emboli. While undergoing intravenous antibiotic therapy, he started to experience progressive symptoms of an ischemic right leg with 4-5 days of purple and cool right foot with pain on ambulation. He was subsequently admitted for right below knee amputation.
71 yo woman transferred from [**Hospital3 412**] Hospital after having unresponsive episode at home followed by vomitting that was witnessed by husband.  History obtained from husband and [**Name (NI) **] records as patient is currently intubated. Husband reports patient had a staring spell followed by dizzy/drunken walking to the bathroom and being unable to get there in time. She had urinary incontinence. Patient was subsequently carried to bed by husband where she was proceeded to vomit. Husband called 911 and she was taken to [**Hospital3 412**] Hosppital. VS 186/82 88 18 AOx3, GCS15. For unknown reasons, patient was subsequently intubated. Head CT revealed large R frontal IPH. She was subsequently trasnferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. In ED, BP 122/77 AF. Nsurg was contact[**Name (NI) **] and assess that no surgical intervention was indicated. Neurology was then consulted.
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a 7-day history of flushing and dyspnea on movement and exertion.  She had an echocardiogram which showed decreased ejection fraction.  She also had a cardiac catheterization which showed left anterior descending artery proximally calcified with 60% to 70% stenosis and mid 70% stenosis, left circumflex with minimal narrowing with small left posterior descending artery, right coronary artery 80% to 90% proximal and medial segment stenosis, ejection fraction of 25% to 30%, severe hypokinesis.
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 31**] is an 81 year old F with a history of HOCM s/p ETOH ablation and ICD placement [**2839**], Atrial fibrillation (on Dronedarone), Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia who presented to ED with shortness of breath. . The patient states that on the day prior to admission, patient had what she thought to be an upper respiratory tract infection. On the AM of [**12-12**], she woke up with significant shortness of breath that was present at rest and with exertion that prompted her to call EMS. She was found to be significantly shortness of breath and was given Lasix 60mg IV x 1. . In the ED, initial vitals were T100.0, 124/67, 88, 24-26, 96% 2LNC. Patient was saturating comfortably on 2L NC after diuresis (unclear exactly how much) and was given Levaquin for cover for possible CAP. She became acutely SOB in the ED (for unclear reasons) and was given another bolus of Lasix 20mg IV x 1. She was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1498**] Cardiology Service. . On arrival to the floor, patient's shortness of breath improved. Shortly after transfer, the patient had a 20 beat run of polymorphic VT that resolved on its own. She then developed another run of polymorphic VT lasting approximately 30 seconds at a rate of 220 BPM. ICD fired and coverted her rhythm to a WCT in 130s (approx 1 min) which appeared to be monomorphic VT on tele given episodes of AV dissociation. This rhythm then spontaneously resolved. She was transferred to CCU and given 4g IV Magnesium. . On tranfer, patient is HD stable. Patient states that feels her SOB is improved. . On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. All of the other review of systems were negative unless included above in HPI. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope (in past several years). Reports dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea this AM.

The patient is a 73 year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, history of deep venous thrombosis and PEs who presents with complaints of worsening shortness of breath. The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 188**] from [**3-7**] to the 4th for an asthma exacerbation.  He was treated with Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers and placed on Flovent and started on a rapid steroid taper.  The patient showed some mild to moderate improvement in his shortness of breath.  He was noted at that time to have a known vocal cord polyp, which was believed to be stable on laryngoscopy down in the Emergency Department. Since that time the patient was seen by Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 214**] of pulmonary in clinic on [**2704-3-17**].  Pulmonary function tests at that time revealed mild restrictive lung disease and flow volume loop revealed extra thoracic obstruction. The patient was diagnosed with vocal cord polyps in [**2703-9-4**] by ENT and it was felt by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 214**] that this was the etiology of the patient's worsening shortness of breath.  Although the patient's symptoms seem to improve with inhalers and steroids after discharge he noted a one week worsening shortness of breath upon exertion, worsening hoarseness and orthopnea.  Concurrently the patient's Lasix dose was changed to 20 mg po q.d. to 40 mg po q.d. on account that there was a question of whether the patient's congestive heart failure was exacerbating.  The patient denies any fever, productive cough, change in peripheral edema, pleurisy or chest pain.  The patient denies any dysphagia with food or liquids, no weight change or night sweats.  The patient had a 25 pack year smoking history, but has quit times several years.  No prior history of chewing tobacco.  No hemoptysis. The patient presented to the Emergency Department on [**3-26**] with increase of inspiratory [**Last Name (un) 15679**].  Chest x-ray was found to be negative.  The patient was satting over 98% on room air.  Given the patient's previous history of pulmonary emboli a CTA was performed, which showed no PEs.  The patient was also seen by ENT in the Emergency Department secondary to significant inspiratory and expiratory [**Last Name (un) 15679**] on examination.  The patient was evaluated at that time with laryngoscopy and it was noted that there was significant edema and erythema of the false cords and folds bilaterally. The left true vocal cord was not able to be visualized and the right vocal cord was immobile.  The bilateral arytenoid was mobile during phonation and inspiration, but without much mobility at the glottic level.  Given the question of a supraglottitis versus laryngeal mass CT of the neck was performed simultaneously with the CT angiogram and showed fullness and thickening of the vocal cords bilaterally with narrowing of the airway.  There was no discreet mass or abnormal lymphadenopathy noted at that time.  Given the significant narrowing of the airway the patient was started on Decadron and Ceftriaxone and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for monitoring of airway.
The patient is an 80-year-old male with significant coronary/vascular past medical history (ejection fraction of 15-20%, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting, peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency), admitted on [**3439-2-11**], for an elective cardiac catheterization secondary to increased dyspnea on exertion. During the procedure, the patient was noted to have a ramus intermedius lesion, and intervention was planned.  The patient developed a dense right-sided hemiparesis and became unresponsive.  He was intubated for airway protection and transferred to the CCU. Head CT showed no evidence of hemorrhage at that time, and therefore it was thought likely to be a left posterior cerebral embolus causing ischemic damage during the procedure, and the patient was started on a Heparin drip. MRI on [**2-12**] revealed hemorrhagic infarct/conversion (left thalamic/occipital lobe, posterior portion, left temporal lobe, cerebellar, and pons).  The Heparin was stopped at this time, and a repeat CT on [**2-12**] confirmed the bleeding.  Another repeat CT on [**2-13**] showed no interval changes. The patient was started on a course of Levofloxacin and Flagyl on [**2-12**] for an increasing white count felt to be possibly left lower lobe atelectasis versus aspiration pneumonia. He was transferred from the CCU to the Neurology Team on [**2-14**] after being extubated on [**2-12**].  On [**2-17**], the patient was noted to be hypernatremic and started on free water boluses but subsequently had desaturations to the low 90s which improved with Lasix.
This is a 58 year old man with known coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**3307**], developed sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain described as eight out of ten on [**1-16**], admitted to an outside hospital and transferred for rule out myocardial infarction.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization.
This is a 70 year old male with Stage 2A esophageal cancer status post chemo and radiation treatment. Also of note, this patient has myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2855**] status post thymectomy and apheresis, transient ischemic attack in the past, silent myocardial infarction in [**2576**], hematuria and rosacea. The patient is admitted at this time for planned laparoscopic and thoracoscopic esophagogastrectomy to be performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 940**]. Mr. [**Known patient lastname 4367**] has a history of developing regurgitation that began in [**2584-8-8**] that was associated with dysphagia without odynophagia and in addition, lost 15 lb. over the months following [**2584-8-8**]. He had a barium swallow which showed a 3 cm polypoid mass in the distal esophagus. Biopsy and esophagoscopy by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15704**] confirmed esophageal carcinoma. An infiltrative, fungated and partially obstructing nonbleeding 5 cm mass was seen at the lower third of the esophagus. On endoscopic ultrasound, it extended through the muscularis propriate consistent with a T3 lesion. No other areas were PET positive. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, weight was 206 lb., pulse 81, blood pressure 134/81, temperature 97.5 degrees F., O2 saturation 97 percent with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. Generally, this was a well-appearing male in no acute distress. Oropharynx was moist and clear with no mucositis or thrush. Sclerae were anicteric. Extraocular motions were intact. Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy cervically or supraclavicularly and there was no infraclavicular lymphadenopathy as well. The heart was in regular rate and rhythm. There were no murmurs, rubs or gallops. Back showed no spinal or costovertebral angle tenderness. Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen was soft, nontender, protuberant, obese with normoactive bowel sounds. Extremities revealed no clubbing or edema. Skin revealed minimal bilateral nasal rosacea, a well- healed mid sternal scar, minimal erythema on the back from radiation skin changes and a port site that was clean, dry and intact with no erythema and was nontender. HOSPITAL COURSE:  Thus, at this time, the patient was admitted for further treatment and evaluation at the [**Hospital1 1426**] in the form of a laparoscopic/thorascopic esophagogastrectomy and on [**2-16**], the patient was brought to the operating room after having been fully preoperatively evaluated where the patient underwent laparoscopic/thorascopic esophagogastrectomy performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 940**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. The patient received 5.8 liters of crystalloid fluid in the operating room and there was a blood loss of an estimated 200 ml during the operation. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was brought to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit after also having received 750 ml of albumin, 500 mcg of fentanyl and 7 mg of vecuronium. He was extubated shortly after the operation on the afternoon of [**2585-2-16**] and was complaining of only peri-incisional pain and tenderness near the right posterior back incision. He stated that he was not short of breath at this time and did not feel weak and did not feel he was having any diplopia. On postoperative day 1, the patient required a bolus of 500 cc of Lactated Ringers for mean arterial pressure near 65 and an elevated lactate, responded well to this and the patient was continued on maintenance level IV fluids. The patient was briefly out of bed during this time. The patient was also followed by the Neuromuscular Service and their plan was to commence Mestinon and CellCept for his myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2855**] in that if the patient began suffering increasing weakness or worsening respiratory status, to call Neurology at once and not to increase the Mestinon and to consider possibly plasmapheresis. The patient was on a planned six doses of Kefzol and Flagyl during this time. The patient was also seen by the Nutrition Service on postoperative day 1 and suggested jejunal tube feeds progressing from half to three-quarter strength. On postoperative day 1, in the evening, the patient seemed to be developing fatigability and respiratory issues and was shown to have some aspect of congestive heart failure on a chest x- ray. The Neurology Service was consulted at once and suggested that the vital capacity and negative inspiratory force be checked every 2 hours and that the patient may need intubation and diuresis. The patient was having a significant oxygen requirement at this time and was also complaining of shortness of breath. He did receive Lasix 10 mg IV times two overnight and was on a nonrebreather mask with an FIO2 of 100 percent. His urine output was noted to briskly increase after both doses of Lasix with some improvement in symptoms and

77yo woman with PMH signficant for atrial fibrillation, CHF EF 35%, hemothorax s/p VATS 1mo ago, and TB with treatment initiated [**9-29**] presents with acute left hemiparesis. She was with her son in her usual state of health around 10:30am when she had acute onset of left hemiparesis, witnessed by her son. EMS was called and she presented to [**Hospital1 18**] as a CODE STROKE at 11:07. Neurology was at the bedside at 11:08am. On arrival, NIHSS was 21 (see below). HCT/CTA/CTP was performed, showing a proximal right MCA occlusion. Interventional radiology was called and she was brought immediately to the INR suite for IA tPA. Of note, the thoracic surgeon was called regarding her recent VATS procedure; he felt she was not at risk for recurrent hemothorax or bleeding from the site given the procedure was 1 month ago. ID was also called, given her recent initiation of RIPE therapy for TB, and did not feel she needed to be on precautions as she had been taking the medications daily since [**9-29**].
A 70-year-old female with a history of scleroderma, osteoarthritis, dermatomyositis who was admitted to an outside hospital back on [**4-26**] with inability to walk and low back pain, mild fevers, and questionable stool incontinence in the setting of colchicine. Was also noted to have a white count of 14,000 and an ESR of 111.  The primary medical team at that point was concerned for epidural abscess, however, the neurological examination at that time did not clearly demonstrate evidence for abscess, and MR of the spine was reported negative for abscess.  However, this MR showed L3-L4 cord compression and was seen by Neurosurgery at the outside hospital, which commented that they felt that this was a diffuse process and nonfocal, and recommended following up with Rheumatology. She was given an empiric course of ceftriaxone and doxycycline at the outside hospital.  She was also scheduled to get a bone scan, but at that time was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation and was sent to the CCU.  She was started on an amiodarone drip for rate control, and was successfully cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm.  She was placed on to Lovenox 60 mg subQ [**Hospital1 **]. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 69**], her vital signs are stable, but unable to provide any reliable history.
This 73 year old Hispanic male underwent mitral valve repair in [**2627**].  he developed hemolytic anemia requiring valve replacement later the same year.  He now has heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and progressive silattion of ther left atrium. he was admitted for reoperation.
The patient is a 78 year old male with a history of stroke (residual partial aphasia), CAD, hypertension, diastolic CHF with recent switch to Torsemide, and AFib with recent initiation Dabigatran who presents with BRBPR.  He had a visit with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2848-1-22**], at which he was feeling well with recent improvement in his LE edema and breathing after switching to Torsemide on [**2848-1-1**].  Immediately after the visit and over the next 3 days, he felt intermittently lightheaded, but otherwise close to his baseline. . Earlier today, he noted BRB after a bowel movement, which was new for him.  Given his recent initiation of Dabigatran in [**Month (only) 400**], he was concerned by the bleeding and contact[**Name (NI) **] his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1009**] recommended [**Name (NI) **] evaluation.  He denies any bruising or easy bleeding other than the above-mentioned blood in his diaper. Over the past couple of hours that is daughter has been with him, he has not had any stools, and he reported that for the most part his stools have been brown. . In the ED, initial VS were T 98.2, HR 90, BP 92/49, RR 16, and SpO2 100% on RA.  Physical exam showed irregular tachycardia, clear lungs, slight LE edema, and benign abdomen.  Rectal exam was notable for bright red blood and streaks of brown stool. Notable labs included Hct 33.7 down from 37.5 on [**2847-12-27**], creatinine 2.6 up from baseline 1.6 with creatine 0.6 on [**2848-1-22**] most likely spurious.  CXR showed no acute process with clear lung fields and mild-moderate cardiomegaly.  ECG showed atrial fibrillation at 86-101 bpm with RBBB, unchanged from prior on [**2848-1-1**].  GI was consulted and recommended observation with consideration of CTA if developing rapid bleeding. . Access was obtained with three 18g PIVs.  He was given normal saline 1500 ml with continued mild tachycardia and blood pressure 90s-100s, which seems to be slightly below his baseline of around 120/80 seen at recent clinic visits.  He was also given about 400 ml of sodium bicarbonate 150 mEq in D5W in anticipation of possible need for CTA. . He was admitted to the MICU for continued monitoring.  VS prior to transfer were T 97.5, HR 80, BP 104/53, RR 20, and SpO2 99% on RA.  On arrival to the MICU, he reported feeling close to his baseline without any specific complaints.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 14623**] is a 78 yo male with hx of recent PNA, sCHF (EF 15-20%), and CAD s/p CABG and ICD placement who was admitted from the ED where he presented with persisent dyspnea and cough despite recent treatment for PNA.  He had a recent admission from [**Date range (1) 14624**] for PNA.  He was treated with a 5 day course of levofloxacin.  His hospital course was complicated by acute renal failure and bacterial conjunctivitis.  Since discharge he states he has not felt well.  He has continued to have a productive cough (denies blood in his sputum).  He has also felt feverish.  He admits to general weakness.  He also reports decreased po intake over the past couple days due to decreased appetite. Of note he had two car accidents in the last day and was evaluated afterwards in the ED. In the ED, intial VS: T 98.1  BP 143/92  HR 68  RR 22  Sat 98% on RA.  He was found to have a worsening RLL PNA on CXR and given cefepime and vancomycin.  Per report from the ED, halfway through the vancomycin infusion he developed acute dypsnea and tachypnea, redness on his arm where the vanc was infusing, and tachycardia.  He was placed on a NRB and treated with nebs.  The infusion was stopped and an EKG was performed which showed ST elevation V2-V4, TWI V5, V6 (different from his initial EKG). Cardiology was consulted who looked at his older EKGs and think the ST changes seen were consistent with his older EKGs (he has an aneurysm).  Labs and CXR were rechecked without much difference from his inital workup.  It was concluded that the reaction likely wasn't from vanc and the rest of the vancomycin was infused.  He was admitted to the ICU instead of the floor because of some concern that he was having an allergic reaction to the vanc. Right before he left the ED he spiked and was given tylenol. On ROS he denies HA, myalgias, arthralgias, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, blood in his stool, or other symptoms. On arrival to the MICU he was quickly weaned off the NRB to 4 l NC.  He denied any chest pain or acute reaction to the vancomycin in the ED.
69yo with hx of MVR (mechanical), anemia of chronic disease (transfusion-dependent), COPD/emphysema and IPF with trans trach on home O2 presented 5 days ago with epistaxis that had been intermitent over last 3 weeks prior to admission which has been chronic issue while on coumadin with negative work up.  In ED was packed by ENT with bilateral packings which required continuous O2 monitoring and stay in the MICU, she was monitored and IR guided emolization was considered, but pt declined the required general anesthesia for an elective procedure with risk of stroke as well from emolization.  Now bleeding has slowed down with minimal packing and she feels better, but still with right sided facial pain/pressure from the packing and possible nerve injury. Also stay complicated by conjunctivitios stable on e-mycin eye drops.  No other shortness of breath or pain or other symptoms except constipation with pain meds.  She is anxious to be about transfer to floor and increased ambulation so she can go home.
59 M PMH of HTN, atrial fibrillation, h/o lymphoma admitted with bradycardia. He presented to ED today with report of [**12-28**] weeks of lightheadedness when standing that has been progressive over that time period.  Also has had increased fatigue.  His beta blocker was restarted in [**8-/3284**] of Toprol 100mg qd.  Prior to that he had an admission in [**3282**] for dyspnea and found to be bradycardic and in CHF.  At that time, his BB was held given the bradycardia and his CHF was treated with iv diuresis. In the ED, VS: BP 129/66, HR 38 RR 11 96% on RA with an unremarkable exam. Labs remarkable for ARF with Cr to 1.4 from baseline of 1.   EKG showed Af with slow venricular rate and a new LBBB.  CXR with fluid overload and he received lasix 40mg iv once. On evaluation on the floor, the patient reports that he feels well laying down but would be dizzy if he tried to get up. He denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, PND or orthopnea. Denies increase lower extremity swelling.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 14772**] is an 80 year old male with known aortic stenosis. He presented with worsening shortness of breath for the past several months along with exertional chest discomfort. He denied symptoms at rest. Cardiac catheterization showed a patent circumflex stent with disease in the distal LAD and obtuse marginal branch. Given his worsening congestive heart failure, he was referred for cardiac surgical intervention.
80 y/o woman with known CAD s/p 2 vessel CABG (10 yrs ago), ischemic cardiomyopathy, CHF last echo [**5-11**] (EF 25%), moderate to severe MR, LBBB, persistent Afib (s/p biventricular pacer and atrioventricular nodal ablation, end of [**2504-5-7**]) and COPD, now presents after palpitation episode at home. Mid [**2504-5-7**], the pt presented to [**Hospital6 33**] with significant heart failure, with Afib and LBBB.  She had an ICD placed ([**1-9**] body habitus, comorbid conditions and age).  After the ICD was placed, she underwent AV junction ablation, which was successful.  She had intermittent episodes of palpitations ("couples of episodes over the last week") without chest pain, diaphoresis, dizziness, lightheadedness or syncope.  No arm numbness or shoulder pain.  One day PTA, she had 2 similar episodes, one of which lasted a few minutes, and one which persisted and prompted her to call EMS.  In the ambulance, she was found to have a wide complex tachycardia (rate 180-200), cycling 310 msec with superior axis morphology based on a 3 lead rhythm strip in the ambulance.  This spontanceously converted. She was given IV adenosine 6mg then 12mg, and 100mg lidocaine, and then spontaneously reverted back to NSR.  In the ER, was in NSR and loaded with 150mg amiodarone and then amiodarone gtt then had another episode of tachyarrhythmia.  EP fellow put a magnet over her which converted her to VOO, back to NSR.  She is being v-paced in the 70s.  She was subsequently admitted to CCU for further mgmt.  Initial CE negative. . Last echocardiogram was [**2504-5-31**]: LV is significantly dilated.

This is a 69 year old Caucasian male admitted with multiple episodes of congestive heart failure with prior multiple admissions, all of which have been medically managed.  The patient had first episode of congestive heart failure approximately three years ago requiring hospitalization.  The patient was subsequently re-evaluated by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for a potential coronary artery bypass graft procedure. The patient had a formal cardiac catheterization at the [**Hospital6 14291**] on [**3214-10-22**].  The patient noted recent increased chest pain and increased dyspnea and lightheadedness.  An echocardiogram done at that time demonstrated findings of severe aortic stenosis, and 80 millimeter aortic valve gradient and also moderate aortic regurgitation. The catheterization revealed significant two vessel coronary artery disease, significant aortic and mitral valve disease. There was 60% distal left anterior descending stenosis. There was a 70% stenosis of the non-dominant right coronary artery.  There is evidence of one over two severe aortic stenosis and moderate aortic regurgitation.  There was evidence of moderate mitral valve regurgitation.  Ejection fraction at that time was noted to be 58%.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 14825**] is a 69-year-old man with a history of CAD (coronary artery disease) status post MI (myocardial infarction) with congestive heart failure in the past, presented to the emergency room on [**10-30**] with a complaint of dyspnea, orthopnea and chest discomfort x10 days.  He had presented to his primary care provider's office prior to that and the primary care sent him to the  emergency room with a CHF (congestive heart failure) exacerbation.  He was cathed about a week following admission, after protracted attempts at diuresis. The catheterization showed three-vessel disease with a 90 percent LAD (left anterior descending), subtotal diagonals 1 and 2, circumflex 80 percent mid stenosis, OM (obtuse marginal) of 90 percent stenosis and a subtotal occlusions of the RCA (right coronary artery), with an EF (ejection fraction) of 35 percent.
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 14844**] is a 63 year-old woman with a history of sarcoidosis who presents on transfer for evaluation of persistent cough/fever and RLL obstruction. . Per the husband and daughter, approximately three months prior to transfer, the patient was eating a chocolate bar with almonds when she apparently aspirated an almond with a subsequent coughing fit.  Over the next few weeks she continued to have coughing spells without improvement. . Seen in pulmonology clinic in [**2526-11-27**] and started on antibiotics, inhalers, prednisone.  PFTs showed FVC 66%, FEV1 60%, FEV/FVC 76% predicted with no change with bronchodilators. TLC was 98% predicted though DLCO was 52% predicted. . Symptoms initially improved with steroids though RLL infiltrate persisted.  Bronchoscopy was done on [**2527-2-14**] and showed segmental material partially obstructing the posterior segment of the RLL with marked friability and edema.  Biopsy showed chronic inflammation with focal acute inflammation superimposed. Immunostains showed crushed material positive for CD-45 and negative for pancytokeratin. . Admitted to OSH on [**2-18**] with fevers/cough.  CT showed RLL consolidation with stenotic areas.  She was treated with antibiotics and discharged home after 5-6 days. . Seen in pulm follow-up and underwent rigid bronchoscopy ([**2527-3-18**]) with removal of foreign body/vegetable material along opening of stenotic bronchis of RLL.  Per the family, the patient continued to have symptoms of cough and fevers in the days after the procedure. . Readmitted to OSH on [**3-27**] with fever, malaise and SOB.  A repeat CT showed RLL infiltrate/atelectasis.  She was continued on steroids and started on zosyn and BiPAP (18/5).  Course was complicated by episodes of tachypnea to 40s.  Also complicated by troponin of 2.69 for which cardiology was consulted; they recommended beta-blocker, aspirin and heparin gtt.  Subsequent echo showed EF of 30% and anterior spetal wall motion abnormality.  Given the complexity of her care, transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] was coordinated.

69 y.o. female with COPD, CHF, DM2, GERD/esophagitis, who was admitted initially on [**3-31**] for cough, SOB, and fever. She was diagnosed with flu/MRSA pneumonia and underlying COPD flare and treated appropriately with tamiflu, antibiotics, and steroids. However, on [**4-3**] she was transferred to the MICU for increasing respiratory distress. Her symptoms gradually improved with supportive care and was transferred back to the medical floor on [**4-7**]. However, the patient next had persistent hypoglemia to the 70s with associated mental status changes requiring D50 and D5NS. Because of difficult to control blood sugars, he was transferred back to the MICU. . Then, on [**4-9**], she was noted to have lower quadrant pain. She underwent CT scan demonstrating a significant abdominal wall rectus sheath hematoma on the left side, 12x5cm. Her Hct dropped from 35.1 to 19.1, requiring 14 units PRBCs, 12 units plasma, and 1 cryo, possibly due to punctured epigastric vein. IR/Vasc surgery was consulted and she underwent angio embolization of the L inferior epigastric vein with insicion and hematoma evacuation x2 followed by VAC. She was taken by the SICU service and was intubated. During her course on the surgical services she had received 24u PRBC, 13FFP, 5 plts, 1 cryo. She then had low grade fevers with spikes to 101, growing pseudomonas from her sputum and urine. Her CVL was changed on [**4-28**] and she underwent trach placement for persistent need for ventilator support. She was started on meropenem on [**4-29**] for the pseudomonal infection. Lastly, she developed acute renal failure with baseline Cr 1.5-1.7 increasing to 2.3->2.7 with FENa of  1.3%. Patient has since been monitored for the aforementioned medical problems during her course in the ICU until discharge.
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 69 year old female with history of DM, COPD, ventilator dependent, hypertension, rectus sheath hematoma [**5-/3017**] who was brought to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital with altered mental status and abdominal pain.
