This 81-year-old elderly lady underwent an open cholecystectomy and common bile duct exploration for type I Mirizzi syndrome three weeks prior to admission.  On [**3096-7-10**], one day prior to admission, she had a normal T-tube cholangiogram without antibiotic coverage.  She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 513**] in his office and approximately two hours later removed the T-tube without incident.  After the removal of the tube, the patient developed progressive nausea and chills and right sided abdominal pain as reported by her daughter.  She presented to the [**Hospital6 253**] Emergency Department hypotensive to 80s systolic and acidotic leading to intubation and institution of pressor support.  Her white count at the time of admission was 12 with a total bilirubin of 3.6.  AST and ALT were both above 500 with an alkaline phosphatase of 334.

CT examination showed no collection and a mildly dilated common bile duct.  Ascending cholangitis secondary to seeding at the time of cholangiogram with stricture at the T-tube site with or without a retained stone was the diagnosis.
HPI: The patient is an 88 year old female, resident at [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 547**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 548**] [**Hospital3 **], with medical history pertinent for Parkinson's disease, Diabetes, and recent cornea transplant who now presents with altered mental status. Per last progress note from patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient has been in her usual state of health with exception of management of a cervical vertebral fracture secondary to fall as well as plans for a repat penetrating keratoplasty (corneal transplant) s/p failed prior. The patient was at that time apparently at her baseline and cleared for surgery. The patient underwent penetrating keratoplasty on [**3103-4-9**] for indication of failed graft without complication. The patient was seen by her ophthalmologist on [**3103-4-14**] with impression that there was moderate lid edema present suggestive of hypersensitivity but no discharge to suggest infection. Polysporin was discontinued (with concern for hypersensitivty per discussion with daughter) and other meds (Pred 1% TID OS, Timolol 0.5% [**Hospital1 **] OU, Xalatan QHS OS, Tobradex [**Doctor Last Name **] OS QHS) continued. The patient now presents form her [**Hospital3 **] with concern for altered mental status. Only limited information is available from available staff at [**Hospital3 396**], with report only that patient was noted tonight to be acutely confused and "not making sense". Per discussion with the patient's daughter, the patient was in her usual state of health as early as yesterday morning, looking well. Later in the day, the patient was reported to be walking up and down the hallway, refusing to go to her room. The patient was noted to be shivering and unsteady on her feet.

The patient was admitted on [**3500-7-3**], for a left nephrectomy and periaortic lymph node dissection and cystoscopy secondary to diagnosis of transitional carcinoma and a left renal mass. She was first seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3500-5-11**], for an evaluation of an episode of gross hematuria that was associated with an enhancing soft tissue mass in the upper pole of the infundibulum of the left kidney. This was diagnosed by CT on [**3500-5-8**]. Now was confirmed by MRI and measured to be 3.3 cm. The patient was then scheduled for a left nephrectomy and staging studies revealed that the right kidney was OK. She has no history of UTIs, colon cancer, smoking or dysuria. However, there is a positive family history for renal cell cancer in her brother who is currently affected. ALLERGIES:  She reports no known drug allergies.

84M PMhx metastatic papillary thyroid CA (s/p resection, radioactive iodine) c/b lung mets, found to have large cavitary mass in RLL, recent admission with malignant effusion + for SCC recently treated for presumed post-obstructive pna.  Prior hospitalization was also notable for PET scan that revealed widely metastatic disease. He presents today from rehab with acute respiratory distress. Pt is [**Name (NI) 589**] speaking so history was obtained from family.  At baseline he is on 2L o2, yesterday he was doing well, but last night he woke up in respiratory distress.  The rehab reported that he was sating at 80% on a non-rebreather mask.  EMS was called and he was transferred the the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  Prior to event, pt denies any fevers or chills, nausea, vomiting.  He has a chronic cough secondary to his lung ca but the quality of the cough did not change.  he is not experiencing any pain. Of note, pt's recent PMH is notable for rapid progression of metastatic lung SCC.  He started experiencing chronic cough and hemoptysis in [**Month (only) 541**] and symptoms have progressed since.  In [**Month (only) 590**] he was noted to have a large cavitary mass in RLL with satellite nodules suggestive of primary lung Ca. At the end of [**Month (only) **] he was admitted to osh with fever, leukocytosis and cough and treated with ctx.  His  symptoms did not improve.  At this time a CT showed cavitary lesion as above and a new large r exudative pleural effusion.  Effusion reaccumulated resulting in supplemental O2 requirement.  As such a chest tube was placed and the cytology came back + for SCC. He was started on vanc zosyn for obstructive pna and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Hospital course was notable for r/o PE, attempted pleurx catheter placement on [**7-19**] that failed due to loculated effusions not amenable to pleurx.  At this point a PET scan was done that showed extensive metastatic dz. In the ED, initial VS were: t 98.1 80 106/46 80s on [**Last Name (LF) 591**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was started on bipap 60 15/5 and his sats improved to 96%.  He was noted to have bilaterally crackles throughout lung fields, and a power picc was in place in right ac fossa. CXR is consistent with prior xrays from earlier this month, but RLL effusion appears to have expanded.  Labs were notable for wbc of 38k with 94% N,  hct was 25 and platelets 504.  He was given vanc and cefepine and transferred to the unit. On arrival to the MICU, pt is somnolent, on bipap and sating in the low 90s.  he is with his family and easily arousable.  He is answering questions appropriately.  His family was concerned that he has been over sedated since he last left [**Hospital1 18**].  The report that he has been sleeping all day and are concerned that he is receiving too much narcotics.  Apparently he was recently started on a fentanyl patch 50mcg at rehab.

86y M with PMH significant for HTN, CAD s/p CABG, afib (now on warfarin), stroke 2y ago, and a seizure disorder on Keppra (previously seen in clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 613**]. atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. who presents with left ear pain. He presented to the OSH ED ([**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 614**]) 1wk PTA with CC: ear pain. He was sent home with Dx of cerumen in external canal. His ear pain continued and this past Friday his PCP prescribed [**Name9 (PRE) 615**] gtt for presumed otitis externa. Per his son, he developed progressive confusion and imbalance. He became unable to walk, and became more somnolent. He returned to the ED at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 614**] in the evening of [**3064-12-19**] (1d prior to transfer here), where his VS were notable for fever to 102.2F (after arriving afebrile) and tachycardia (normalized with 1.5 L IVF), and exam was notable for somnolence. His WBC was elevated at 14.9. INR was 3.3. Dig 0.84. Troponin negative. UA "negative" and CBC/BMP/LFTs reportedly unremarkable/wnl. A NCHCT showed *Left mastoiditis*. He was given a dose of IV Zosyn. ENT was consulted, and recommended admission for surgical Tx the following morning and switching to CTX (2gm IV) for mastoiditis Tx. He was given his evening dose of warfarin after clearance from ENT, with a plan for ENT surgery and ID consultation in the morning. However, around 6:00am the morning after admission ([**3063-12-21**]), the patient had a GTC seizure requiring 12mg IV lorazepam to stop. He was loaded with 1gm of IV phenytoin and his levetiracitam was increased to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] (from his home dose of 750mg [**Hospital1 **]). He was intubated and maintained on a propofol gtt on and off. His post-ictal exam was notable for spontaneous movements of all four extremities, but lack of eye opening/arousability. A Neurologist there saw the patient, but his notes are not immediately available to me. His HCT was repeated after the seizure, and a very tiny focus of hemorrhage (hyperintensity) was seen at the posterior end of the Left lateral ventricle (~trigone). There was also also a call of hyperintensity in the interpeduncular fossa (which would, if true, suggest subarachnoid blood, but on reviewing the images I think this is an overcall). Finally, there was a large hypodensity in the Right temporal lobe, which looks old, and could be the "old stroke" seen on MRI in [**3062**] on OSH workup in [**State 616**] for his only previous GTC seizure (see PMH, below). The OSH physicians thought he may have hemorrhagic conversion of an acute stroke in the Right temporal lobe (despite a lack of any evidence for this on the NCHCT), and held his warfarin, which was a good idea anyway because he had a supratherapeutic INR at the time of 3.7. After discussing the case with a Neurologist here at [**Hospital1 18**], they decided to hold off on reversing his coagulopathy with vitamin K or FFP. They continued his statin. Regarding his infectious and other general medical workup/treatment, he had [**2-20**] BCx bottles return positive for GPC in pairs. The cultures were repeated post-antibiotics. A TTE was obtained out of concern for septic cerebral embolus, and it did not show valvular vegitations, but did show several thickened/diseased valves. TEE was considered, but not done. He was given a couple liters of IVF for decreased urine output (and urine was dark on arrival here). He was continued on his digoxin (level y/d was 0.86), and his home BB and CCB were held. He was doing just find on MV/CMV with ABG of 7.39/35/174 and an unremarkable CXR. They did not start tube feeds.

Cardiovascular:  Regular rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. Skin:  No obvious lesions.  Neurological:  She was arousable to voice but then fell back to sleep.  Speech:  Sparse. Repetition intact.  She had a left visual space neglect.  She was impersistent with motor exam testing.  She did not consistently follow commands.  Her pupils were 4 down to 3 mm bilaterally.  Her face was symmetric.  Tongue midline.  She moved all extremities well.  Triceps and biceps were 4+ out of 5 bilaterally.  IP at least 3 out of 5 bilaterally. Gastrocs 5 out of 5.  Deep tendon reflexes 3+ in the upper extremities, 3 at the patella, and 2 at the Achilles.  Toes were equivocal. IMAGING:  The patient had a head CT that showed right parietal temporal mass with right-to-left midline shift and depression of the right lateral ventricle with left lateral ventricle slightly dilated. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Neurosurgery Service.  She received an MRI.  The patient's mental status deteriorated.  She became unresponsive with a blown right pupil.  The patient was taken to the Operating Room emergently for craniotomy for excision and biopsy of the tumor. The patient underwent a right parietal temporal craniotomy for excision of tumor without intraoperative complications. Postoperatively the patient was monitored in the Recovery Room over night.  Her vital signs were stable.  She awakened easily to voice, saying her name.  Pupils were 6 down to 5 mm bilaterally to ambient light.  She withdrew briskly in her upper and lower extremities. On postoperative day #1, she was awake and alert.  Pupils were 5 down to 4 mm.  She had a left neglect visually. Strength was symmetric.  Finger flexors and IPs bilaterally. She was improved and was much more awake and alert. The patient was seen by Neuro-oncology who recommended Radiation/Oncology and possible chemotherapy.  She was transferred to the regular floor on postoperative day #1. She was out of bed and ambulating.  She was assessed by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and found to require a short rehabilitation stay prior to discharge to home. She was also seen by Endocrine due to the mass near her hyperthalamus.  TSH was slightly decreased with a normal T4. Endocrine recommended follow-up on PFTs in two weeks. The patient was therefore prepared for rehabilitation and discharged to rehabilitation on [**3114-3-25**], with follow-up in the Brain Tumor Clinic on Monday for staple removal.

This is a 59 yo F with a history of DM2 and HTN who presents with L greater than R flank pain, associated with nausea and visual blurring. Patient has had L sided flank pain since the night prior to admission. This was associated with blurry vision for the past 1-2 days, and headache over the last few hours. She has not had dysuria, hematuria, vomiting, or fevers. No abdominal pain. No diarrhea. She does have a history of HTN and is compliant with her antihypertensives. Of note, she had much more severe flank pain 6 weeks ago. She was told to drink fluids for potential kidney stone. She had imaging done in [**State 753**], at her home, that showed no obvious stones. Apparently she was referred to a nephrologist at that time and was told she had some evidence of kidney failure. She was first told she may have kidney failure in [**3297-7-7**]. She was seen by nephrology, but does not know any further details. She has never been on dialysis before. She did not have this flank pain at that time. Patient brought labs from previous appointments. [**4-2**] Cr 3.29. [**4-21**] Cr 3.07, HCT 31.1. In the emergency department BP was 221/71. She recived 200mg IV labetalol and was started on a 1mg/min labetalol gtt. BP came down to 176/92. HR 77. RR21. O2 sat 88%. On arrival to the MICU, patient's flank pain is much improved. No headache, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or shortness of breath.
This is a 66-year-old man with severe CAD, status post CABG in [**3050**] with recent PCI to the LMCA and SVG to the PDL in [**3058-6-20**].  He presented on [**3058-7-30**] for an elective intervention brachytherapy of the SVG to PL and native RCA.  The patient reported that he had been feeling well without chest pain, shortness of breath, or dyspnea on exertion.  He was noted to have an ejection fraction of greater than 60 percent in [**3058-6-20**].  The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on the morning of arrival with PCI to the native RCA and 4 stents and brachytherapy to the vein graft.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and approximately 6 hours later developed a chest pain noted as 4 out of 10 substernal radiating to his throat and back without shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea or vomiting.  EKG at that time revealed ST elevation in II, III, and aVF.  The patient was brought back to the catheterization laboratory at that time.  They found that the SVG to PL have been thrombosed.  The artery was opened in the catheterization laboratory, AngioJet had been unsuccessful and the graft was opened with Nipride with subsequent TIMI 3 flow.  The patient had persistently occluded communication between the native RCA and the vein graft.  Postprocedure, after the sheath pull, a hematoma developed and the patient had baseline low blood pressure of systolic in the 90s.
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old young lady with a history of hypothyroid, previous appendectomy and hysterectomy who presented to the Emergency Department with a one day history of severe abdominal pain.

Liver function tests, ALT 16, AST 28, alkaline phosphatase 78, total bilirubin 0.5, amylase 43.  Urinalysis, trace leukocytes, small blood, trace ketones, red blood cells [**3-30**] and white blood cells [**3-30**]. Chest x-ray showed free air in his diaphragm on the right. Abdominal x-rays, upright film showed free air with air in the colon.  Stool absent all the way down through the colon. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and placed on Ampicillin, Levofloxacin, and Flagyl.  Blood cultures were sent.  On hospital day #1, [**2833-9-30**], the patient underwent partial gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy with placement of feeding J-tube for a perforated gastric ulcer. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications during the surgery.  The patient was placed in the Intensive Care Unit over night, intubated.  On [**2833-10-1**], postoperative day #1, the patient was weaned from ventilator support and extubated without difficulty.  The patient's renal function improved to producing over 30 cc/hr and soft bowel sounds were appreciated.  On postoperative day #3 the patient was transferred to the floor.  On the floor, the patient was started on half-strength tube feeds.  Total parenteral nutrition was continued and by [**10-6**], postoperative day #6 the patient was tolerating sips.  On the day of [**10-5**], the patient had one episode of atrial fibrillation that was successfully controlled with intravenous Lopressor.  By [**10-7**], the patient was tolerating liquids without difficulty.  Total parenteral nutrition had been stopped, antibiotics had been stopped and rehabilitation planning had started.  Tube feeds were increased to almost goal.  On [**10-8**], the patient was tolerating full liquids without difficulty and was discharged to rehabilitation.  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation in good condition.  She is able to ambulate with assistance, tolerate full liquids and has no further need for antibiotics.

Pt. is an 83y/o F with a PMH of diverticulosis recently discharged on [**2624-7-6**] s/p LGIB secondary to bleeding diveriticulus admitted [**7-11**] with BRBPR. . During prior hospitalization pt. was admitted with a 2 week history of BRBPR at home. On [**6-28**] a diverticular bleed found on first colonoscopy, epi injected, but patient with continued LGIB which was seen in the distal sigmoid on tagged RBC study [**7-1**]. The bleeding was not deemed amenable to angio intervention. Repeat colonoscopy on [**7-2**] not able to identify further source of bleeding. Pt discharged on [**7-6**] with a stable hct. . Since that time Pt. was doing well at home until she again had an episode of BRBPR which she reported to fill the commode. Pt. also reported L chest pain occurring episodically over the past few days. Pt. brought to ED by her daughter yesterday. In ED vitals: temp 97, HR 110, BP 161/90, RR 18 O2sat 98% 4LNC. Pt. soaked her pad on ED bed with BRB. Labs included HCT 37, unremarkable CBC, electrolytes, CEs and LFTs. CXR unremarkable. EKG SR@ 105bpm, no ischemic changes, unchanged from prior. Pt. given SL NTGx1, morphine 2mg IVx1, was given 2L NS. Admitted to MICU for further evaluation. . In MICU pt. was transfused 2U PRBCs. Surgery consulted and felt no acute intervention was needed. GI consulted, deferred colonoscopy at this time.  UA positive and pt. started on cipro. B-blocker initially held due to bleeding, restarted [**7-12**].
76 yo F walking to dentists office [**2-17**] and had SOB/CP/diaphoresis. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where cath showed 4+MR. Referred for MVR.
HPI:76yo female, retired nun presents from [**Hospital3 922**] Hospital s/p fall down down [**4-12**] steps. Pt was alert upon ems arrival and became unresponsive enroute to hospital. Pt. CT scan revealed bilateral SDH left greater than right. + skull fracture.
62 year old female with chronic low back pain s/p multiple lumbar surgeries presents for elective anterior/posterior decompression laminectomy on [**3308-7-3**].
The patient is a 74-year-old female with increased shortness of breath and chest pain with exertion x 2 weeks.  She went to an outside hospital and was transferred here to [**Hospital1 69**] for catheterization.  The patient had right CA stent placed in [**3421**].  Cardiac catheterization showed 90% left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis, 90% diagonal stenosis, 90% circumflex stenosis and 80% right coronary artery stenosis.  Ejection fraction was roughly 68%.
This is a 75-year-old female patient who had a very prolonged previous hospitalization at the [**Hospital1 69**] and was ultimately discharged on [**3429-4-2**].  During her hospitalization, she underwent coronary artery bypass graft x4 with an aortic valve replacement.  Her postoperative course was complicated by aspiration, wound infection of her sternal wound as well as of her saphenectomy, gastrostomy tube placement, followed by necrosis of the abdominal wall as well as acute renal failure.  Please see discharge summary from that hospitalization for details of her postoperative course after her cardiac surgery. The patient was readmitted to the hospital on [**3429-4-11**] due to fevers to 103 at the rehabilitation facility despite being on intravenous antibiotics.  In the Emergency Department, the patient was noted to have a fair amount of purulent drainage in the open sternal wound.  The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at that time.
The patient is a 75-year-old female, status post a long hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] culminating in CABG x 4, porcine AVR, aspiration, infection, sternal wound infection, saphenous vein site infection, status post a G-tube with abdominal wall necrosis, status post J-tube, ARF requiring hemodialysis.  The patient eventually discharged on [**3429-4-2**].  Then readmitted on [**3429-4-11**] for fever to 103.  In VICU for sternal wound infection and transferred to [**Hospital **] Rehab. At [**Hospital1 **], two days prior to admission per report, the patient had a PEA arrest, status post epinephrine.  The patient went into V-fib arrest, status post 100 mg joule shock which converted into A-fib.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital late PM on [**3429-5-3**].  The patient there was continued on vent.  Chest x-ray and CT showed a bilateral lower lobe consolidation and left upper lobe consolidation.  The [**Year (4 digits) **] report from [**Hospital 8**] Hospital attributed mucous plugging and vent associated pneumonia leading to PEA arrest.  Also contributing were elements of hyperkalemia, hypoxia and hypovolemia. The patient had initially had episodes of SVT in the 70s-90s which responded to 250 of normal saline.  The patient remained in atrial fibrillation and spontaneously converted to sinus.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for continuity of care.
The patient is a 75 year old female with an extremely complicated past medical history including coronary artery bypass graft times four, atrial ventricular valve replacement in [**11-17**], and a precipitously difficult postoperative course.  The patient has never been weaned from her ventilator and has had multiple ventilator associated pneumonias, particularly most recently with pseudomonas Serratia and Klebsiella.  The patient has end stage renal disease and history of gastrointestinal bleed secondary to gastritis and esophagitis. Most recently, the patient was discharged from this hospital to rehabilitation in early [**Month (only) 541**] only to come back with fevers and ultimately grew out Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus wound infection requiring debridement on [**3429-4-2**].  The patient returned to rehabilitation [**3429-4-27**], where she sustained a pulmonary embolus arrest, received Epinephrine and electrical conversion.  The patient was noted to have decreased responsiveness post code attributed to anoxic brain injury per neurology.  She was transferred back to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation where she underwent vigorous physical therapy. On [**3429-6-6**], per family she had a fever of 103 with culture peripherally and from her dialysis catheter.  Both grew out Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  The patient was started on a course of Vancomycin with only low grade temperature.  She became lethargic on [**3429-6-14**], and was unable to tolerate hemodialysis due to hypotension, systolic blood pressure in the 70s.  The patient briefly improved postdialysis on [**3429-6-15**], as did her mental status, but then became increasingly lethargic with heart beats in the 130s, blood pressure 80 over palpable, and was transferred over to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management. On arrival, the patient was noted to be extremely febrile, hypotensive, tachypneic.  The patient received an A line and right internal jugular central line for monitoring and fluid resuscitation.  The patient's course was complicated by her poor toleration of hemodialysis secondary to hypotension and was started on pressors of Levophed and ultimately required an addition of vasopressor.  The patient was becoming increasingly somnolent and had not defervesced at this time despite the addition of multiple antibiotic therapy, Flagyl, Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, and Tobramycin. CT of the abdomen and chest showed no frank abscess or fluid collection.  Flagyl was ultimately discontinued as decreased probability of anaerobic infection.  Cultures at outside hospital showed multidrug resistant organisms including Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  Transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained to rule out endocarditis and it was negative showing ejection fraction of 55%.  Left Hickman catheter with [**Hospital1 **] as probable source of infection. Foley was placed at this time.  The patient was anuric yet 10cc of purulent material was noted.  The patient was now growing gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters from two different sites, the Hickman and/or previous PICC line.  She was increasing her pressor requirement and was hypotensive despite two liters of fluid. She was started on Dopamine in addition to her Levophed and vasopressors. Throughout the day, the patient's systolic blood pressure decreased to the 80/30.  By [**3429-6-19**], she was back on EC vent control.  The patient was noted at 3:43 a.m. on [**3429-6-20**], to have an episode of asystole.  The family was at bedside as well throughout the night.  The pupils were noted to be fixed and dilated and unresponsive.  Ventilation was discontinued and spontaneous respirations were not observed.  The patient was declared dead at 3:43 a.m. The family declined autopsy.

55 year-old female presents with 2/5 week history of non-bloody diarrhea. Patient states that diarrhea is often preceeded by right and left lower quadrant cramping and discomfort. Symptoms are relieved with voiding and evucation. She denies fever, nausea and/or emesis. She reports two episodes of chills. She presents today with fatigue. She denies abdominal distension or hematesis. Denies urinary symptoms. She was recently seen by her Primary Care Physician for evaluation of diarrhea and by report stool O&P cultures were negative.
Patient is a 65-year-old man recently evaluated for worsening dyspnea on exertion.  The patient was first evaluated for dyspnea on exertion back in [**3308-10-28**].  At that point, he was found to have mild left coronary artery disease as well as a totally occluded right coronary artery with good collaterals.  He was also noted to have a moderate mitral regurgitation.  He was managed medically for this condition. During the course of the year [**3310**], the patient noted progressive decrease in his activity tolerance.  After work up, it was determined that the patient was in need of repair of his mitral valve as well as coronary artery bypass grafting.
The pt is a 59 year-old right-handed with progressively worsening stiffness, weakness, and dysarthria since [**3068**] who is sent in from her rehab for generalized weakness , decline and difficulty eating. The patient is followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 939**] in the movement disorders division who notes an extensive negative workup in his most recent assessment of [**3071-12-12**] (see below). Per the record the stiffness started after a fall on ICE in [**3068**]. She was admitted 7/21-26/07 for left leg dystonia. Possible etiologies considered at that time included hereditary spastic paraparesis, Parkinsons, and multiple systems atrophy. Little evidence could be found for any of these disorders. An new EMG today demonstrated a generalized, moderately severe, chronic and ongoing disorder of motor neurons or their axons. The patient has been on tizanidine, flexeril, baclofen, sinemet, and artane - none with particularly significant effect.
This is an 84-year-old male referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for evaluation of surgical options for severe aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease. The patient experienced a near-syncopal episode in [**3402-1-9**]; for which she was evaluated at [**Hospital 1034**] [**Hospital 1035**] Hospital. As part of his workup, the patient received a cardiac catheterization which subsequently demonstrated severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.78 cm2 and mild grade [**12-12**] aortic insufficiency.  In addition, the patient demonstrated 3-vessel disease of the right coronary artery, left anterior descending artery, and circumflex with diffuse 68% stenosis of each. Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1036**] was subsequently evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and recommended for elective coronary artery bypass graft and aortic valve repair to take place on [**3402-4-26**].

This 81 year old woman has a history of COPD. Over the past five years she has had progressive difficulties with her breathing. In [**2978-5-23**] she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation. Due to persistent hypoxemia, she required intubation and a eventual bronchoscopy on [**2978-5-28**] revealed marked narrowing of the airways on expiration consistent with tracheomalacia. She subsequently underwent placement of two silicone stents, one in the left main stem and one in the trachea. During the admission the patient had complaints of chest pain and ruled out for an MI. She was subsequently discharged to [**Hospital1 **] for physical and pulmonary rehab. Repeat bronchoscopy on [**2978-7-20**] revealed granulation tissue at the distal right lateral wall of the tracheal stent. There was significant malacia of the peripheral and central airways with complete collapse of the airways on coughing and forced expiration. Small nodules were also noted on the vocal cords. She has noticed improvement in her respiratory status, but most recently has been in discussion with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 939**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 940**] regarding possible tracheobronchial plasty with mesh.

Currently, she notices it about three times a week, and states that it seems to resolve after three nitroglycerin. She currently is dependent on oxygen and wears 1.5-2 liters around the clock. She has frequent coughing and brings up "dark sputum".
87 yo F with h/o CHF, COPD on 5 L oxygen at baseline, tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent, presents with acute dyspnea over several days, and lethargy. This morning patient developed an acute worsening in dyspnea, and called EMS. EMS found patient tachypnic at saturating 90% on 5L. Patient was noted to be tripoding. She was given a nebulizer and brought to the ER. . According the patient's husband, she was experiencing symptoms consistent with prior COPD flares. Apparently patient was without cough, chest pain, fevers, chills, orthopnea, PND, dysuria, diarrhea, confusion and neck pain. Her husband is a physician and gave her a dose of levaquin this morning. . In the ED, patient was saturating 96% on NRB. CXR did not reveal any consolidation. Per report EKG was unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation revealed a leukocytosis if 14 and lactate of 2.2. Patient received combivent nebs, solumedrol 125 mg IV x1, aspirin 325 mg po x1. Mg sulfate 2 g IV x1, azithromycin 500 mg IVx1, levofloxacin 750 mg IVx1, and Cefrtiaxone 1g IVx1. Patient became tachpnic so was trialed on non-invasive ventilation but became hypotensive to systolics of 80, so noninvasive was removed and patient did well on NRB and nebulizers for about 2 hours. At that time patient became agitated, hypoxic to 87% and tachypnic to the 40s, so patient was intubated. Post intubation ABG was 7.3/60/88/31. Propafol was switched to fentanyl/midazolam for hypotension to the 80s. Received 2L of NS. On transfer, patient VS were 102, 87/33, 100% on 60% 450 x 18 PEEP 5. Patient has peripheral access x2. .

77 y/o F with PMhx of Developmental Delay, COPD, HL, HTN and Mirizzi syndrome who presented today for elective ERCP.  Pt was felt to be functionning at baseline prior to procedure with mild agitation, pulling at PIVs but interacting with staff.  She was given fent/midaz for ERCP with stent placement and was transferred to the post-ERCP suite in stable condition. She had elevated BPs during the procedure requiring labetalol and metoprolol. She was found mildly tachypneic/wheezing with emesis on her gown. It was felt likely that she had an aspiration event with low grade temp  However, she was still moving all four extremities and responding appropriately to questions though mildly sedated prior to transfer to the floor. . On arrival to the floor, pt was minimally responsive to sternal rub and did not withdraw to focal stimuli.  She was notably tachypneic and eyes were deviated to right side.  She was able to track to left with stimuli and would intermittently open eyes to command.   Pt had an ABG 7.4/36/92 with lactate of 3.5 and CXR showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.  Due to concern for acute intracranial hemmorrhage, she was taken down for a stat CT head.  On return to the floor, pt was given narcan without any significant change in mental status.  Neuro was consulted for possible acute stroke and within a few minutes, she became more responsive, opening eyes spontaneously. By the time neuro came to bedside, pt was able to verbalize her name and was noted to be using the right arm and had left sided deficit.  A CODE stroke was called and pt was taken for urgent CTA head which did not show any vessel obstruction and TPA was felt unlikely to be helpful.  Perfusion images confirmed right temporal hypoperfusion consistent with clinical exam and likely right MCA infarct.  ICU consult was initiated and pt's guardian was notified.  Pt was given Vanc/Cefepime and Aspirin 300mg PR while awaiting ICU transfer.  She was lying flat per neuro recs and was noted to be spitting up bilious emesis.  Head of bed was elevated and pt was suctionned prior to transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring of airway and management of acute pneumonia.

In brief, this is a 64 yo M with hx of melanoma s/p craniotomy and resection of metastatic melanoma in brain. He was initially admitted after found down on [**3-13**]. Had multiple intraparencymal hematomas, SAH, SDH. Underwent resection of tumor and cyst cavities on [**3-16**]. S/p craniotomy which was done on [**3-16**] he has been aphasic and had ongoing myoclonic seizures. He was monitored on EEG and last seizure was 3 days ago, thought to be in setting of sepsis and lowered sz threshhold. He is currently on max doses of dilantin and Keppra and being followed by neuro for AED recommendations. He was transferred to MICU for management of septic shock after blood cx grew enterobacter cloacae (possibly spread from urine). He was on CTX but currently on meropenem, afebrile, and no leukocytosis. He has a PICC line in place for a 14-day course of meropenem. LP was done in MICU and was normal. Throughout the MICU stay he has been tachycardic with a fib and flutter intermittently on tele. On [**3-25**] he was ruled out for PE with negative CTA and LENIs. He responds to fluids and HR is currently in the 90s on PO diltiazem and metoprolol. [**Name (NI) **] sister is his HCP and has recently made him DNR/DNI, she would like to discuss goals of care with the primary team. Neuro-oncology has been following and he may require XRT but there has been some discussion of his current poor performance status limiting gains of further therapy. ROS: as in HPI
This 66 year old man has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and obesity. He has been followed in the [**Month/Day/Year 2170**] clinic for quite some time. Over the summer the patient noticed several episodes of bilateral shoulder discomfort while walking up a slight incline on the golf course. These episodes would resolve quickly with rest and then he would be able to continue on with the rest of his game without symptoms. Several weeks ago the patient noticed similar bilateral shoulder discomfort after walking only 100 feet.  He did not experience any chest discomfort, shortness of breath or other associated symptoms and again, after several minutes of rest his discomfort resolved. He sought consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2171**] who referred him for stress testing. He exercised 8.25 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol, reaching 79% of his maximum predicted heart rate. At peak exercise there was diffuse 2.0-3.0 ST segment depression in the inferior leads and 1.0-2.0 mm depression in leads I and V3-V6. The rhythm was sinus with APB??????s and one PVC. Post exercise there were frequent PVC??????s noted including ventricular bigeminy and trigeminy. Imaging revealed a mostly reversible perfusion defect of the septum and apex. A fixed inferior wall defect was also noted.  LVEF was 48%. He is now referred for cardiac catheterization to further evaluate.
This 48-year-old [**First Name3 (LF) 1214**] has mental retardation and a seizure syndrome. He presents to our emergency room acutely with reports of [**1-6**] days of abdominal pain as described by his caretakers, who find him grimacing in an umbilical position. He had a change in bowel habits and decreased PO intake for 2 weeks. He is largely unresponsive and he responds only to keep the stimulation for pain. He has had fevers for the last few days, up as high as 104 degrees. A workup was performed for this, and initial imaging of the abdomen showed multiple views consistent with a free air in the abdomen. This with a lactic acidosis, distended abdomen and a neutrophilia band shift, along with the after mentioned history was very concerning for an acute process which required an emergent operation. This was especially so given the fact that we could not adequately communicate with this [**Name2 (NI) 1214**] and did not know the full extent of his recognition of pain due to his mental retardation.

49 yo female who has had blood loss over a period of several months and has had abnormal colonoscopies which have shown some areas of stricturing. This has been unusual but is thought most likely to be due to Crohn's disease. She has been on steroids but still with problems. She presents now with a hematocrit of 20. She is a Jehovah's witness and will not accept any blood transfusions. After consultation with her General Medical physician and also with the hematology service, it was thought that it would not be possible to increase her hematocrit significantly prior to operation without at least a 1 month delay. It was also thought likely that any improvement in iron therapy would be off-set by continued bleeding. The patient and her partner understand the gravity of this situation and the need for operation under less than optimum circumstances. The patient has again expressed her wish that she not be given blood products, but she would accept certain other types of fluid. She presents now for right colectomy.

He developed paralysis of the left leg due to radiation in [**3473**] and has been dependent on a brace and crutches. He developed radiation colitis with periodic rectal bleeding and incontinence of stool and urine in [**3476**]. He developed recurrent lymphoma in the porta hepatis and was treated with radiation therapy in [**3492-10-19**]. He also received CHOP and RICE. He developed a biliary stricture and common hepatic duct obstruction and underwent ERCP and stent placement in [**3492-9-19**] and [**3493-7-20**]. Those stents were removed. In [**3496-2-20**], he presented with fever and elevated LFTs. He had an ERCP at that time and was subsequently referred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he underwent an ERCP on [**3-12**]. This demonstrated the presence of an existing plastic stent that was blocked with sludge and was removed. He had small stone fragments and pus that were seen extruding from the common duct once the stent was removed. There was a long benign-appearing stricture of the common bile duct and common hepatic duct with dilatation of the intrahepatic ducts proximally. Cytology was negative. Since then, he has undergone several follow-up ERCPs and dilatation. He has also undergone repeated brushings for cytology that have all been benign. . Because of recurrent stricture that has been unresponsive to endoscopic dilatation, he was referred for consideration of Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. We have discussed the indications for surgical repair, the surgical procedure itself, risks, potential complications, postoperative recovery, follow-up, and outcomes. The patient has provided informed consent and is brought to the operating room for cholecystectomy, common bile duct excision, and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.
The patient is a 26-year-old woman with a history of IV drug abuse, who initially presented to an outside hospital on [**3258-2-9**] from a drug and detoxification facility with a chief complaint of headache, abdominal pain, and fever.

This study demonstrated 50 white blood cells (84% neutrophils), 10 red blood cells, protein of 23, glucose of 86, and 0-5 yeast per high power field.  Given these findings and concern for meningitis, the patient received Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and gentamicin at the outside hospital.  Given the lack of Intensive Care Unit beds at the outside hospital, the patient was therefore transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation. On arrival to the Emergency Department at the [**Hospital1 341**], the patient was found to have icteric sclerae, a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, abdominal guarding, and right upper quadrant tenderness.  Given the concern for an abdominal process, the patient was given levofloxacin and metronidazole; she was also given Ambisome given the finding of yeast in her CSF at the outside hospital. In the Emergency Department, she had an abdominal ultrasound that was negative for the presence of gallbladder or ductal dilatation.  Also at this time, the patient began to deny the report that she was HIV positive; this report has been obtained only by report and not by documented laboratory testing from the outside hospital.

This 82 year old white female with coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft, cerebrovascular accident, diabetes, hypertension, renal artery stenosis, status post left renal artery stent, peripheral vascular disease, had undergone a right common femoral to anterior tibial artery bypass graft with PTFE on [**3305-1-1**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  After the patient developed gangrene of her lower saphenectomy site with two ulcers. The patient did well until she had a catheterization via her right groin in [**3307-6-2**].  The patient developed a right groin hematoma which was evacuated in [**3307-6-2**].  At that time there was no graft involvement. The patient was sent to the [**Hospital6 1991**] Emergency Room from [**Hospital6 306**] on [**3307-7-20**] with recent history of fevers and development of a pulsatile mass in her right groin.  The right groin began to bleed and the patient was sent for evaluation.  In the Emergency Room the patient was diagnosed with an infected pseudoaneurysm and was admitted for emergency surgery.
Patient is an 83-year-old, Russian only speaking female admitted due to likely cellulitis of her right above the knee amputation stump.  Her history was limited by absence of a family member or translator at the time of interview, and the remainder of her history was obtained from her medical record. Past medical history includes coronary artery disease, status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent in [**3304**], coronary artery bypass graft in [**3304-9-2**], cerebrovascular accident in [**3301**], right medullary cardiovascular accident in [**3307-5-3**], seizure disorder, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, carotid artery stenosis, renal artery stenosis status post stent placement in the left renal artery, recurrent urinary tract infection, severe depression status post ECT therapy, left femoral neck fracture, right groin hematoma, recurrent urinary tract infections, peripheral vascular disease. Past surgical history includes repair of a ruptured infected right femoral pseudo aneurysm, coronary artery bypass graft, right common femoral to anterior tibial artery bypass graft with a PTFE and distal talar vein patch in [**3304**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], left closed reduction internal fixation of the left hip fracture, and evacuation of right groin hematoma. SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient does not drink alcohol.  She does not smoke cigarettes.  She has a son and daughter-in-law and daughter who are involved in her care. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.8, heart rate 70, blood pressure 118/74, sating 96 percent on room air.  In general, the patient was alert, in no acute distress.  She has slight scleral icterus and some sublingual icterus.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, obese; positive bowel sounds.  She has a bluish tinge periumbilically. Extremities, particularly the left lower extremity, show 2 to 3 plus pitting edema.  Pulses right femoral is 2 plus, left femoral 2 plus, popliteal 1 plus, DP triphasic, PT triphasic. PERTINENT RESULTS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 9.3 with 73 percent neutrophils.  Creatinine of 1.5. CT of the legs showed skin thickening and subcutaneous stranding in the medial thigh corresponding to physical exam without underlying abscess, similar skin thickening and pronounced subcutaneous stranding and extensive soft tissue attenuation surrounding the prosthetic graft in the anterior lateral thigh also suspicious for infection, mottled and demineralized appearance of the femur likely related to disease. Medications on admission include nifedipine 30 mg p.o. once daily, metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., atorvastatin 20 mg p.o. once daily, glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily, valsartan 80 mg p.o. once daily, levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. once daily, buspirone 10 mg p.o. b.i.d., bupropion 150 mg p.o. b.i.d., multivitamin 1 cap p.o. once daily, acetaminophen 325 to 650 mg p.o. q. [**5-8**] p.r.n., lorazepam at 1.5 mg p.o. at bedtime, vancomycin 1 gm IV q. 48h., Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d., heparin 5000 units subcutaneously b.i.d. Patient was admitted on [**3309-2-22**] and was continued on IV vancomycin and levofloxacin for presumed right above the knee amputation stump infection.  She was also evaluated for heart failure causing the peripheral edema.  During the patient's stay she had considerable difficulty receiving blood pressure control.  This required multiple medication maneuvers. She was taken on [**3309-2-25**] to the Operating Room for an I and D of the infected leg and removal of her right thigh graft, which she tolerated well.  Renal function was a concern, however, afterwards and her chronic renal insufficiency with acute exacerbation required monitoring. Postoperatively, she continued to receive her IV antibiotics and did receive a PICC line for easier administration.  Also postoperatively, the patient was seen by Psychiatry both for treatment of her severe depression as well as acute mental status exacerbations and need for a one-to-one sitter. After a couple days of dressing changes soaked in acetic acid, the patient's leg wound had a VAC dressing placed, which worked well for healing purposes. On postoperative day 3 the patient did experience a fever and received a fever workup.  Her chest x-ray did not have any CHF or pneumonia.  She also had blood and urine cultures performed.  During her stay the patient did require blood transfusion which did cause a degree of heart failure and the need for Lasix.  Cardiac service was made involved at that

He was intubated and given Epinephrine.  He was in pulseless electrical arrest which converted to sinus rhythm after five minutes.  He was brought to [**Hospital3 **] where he was unresponsive and head CT was negative for bleed. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] [**3402-10-11**], for cardiac catheterization which showed clean coronary arteries with ejection fraction of 41%; cardiac echocardiogram [**3402-10-12**], showed ejection fraction greater than 55%.  It is not clear why he had a cardiac arrest given his lack of coronary artery disease on cardiac catheterization. He was started on Levofloxacin/Vancomycin/Flagyl given that he had high cardiac output on Swan and there was concern for sepsis.  Antibiotics were switched to Levofloxacin and Flagyl after respiratory culture showed H. influenzae on [**3402-10-15**]. Since his arrival at [**Hospital1 69**], he remained unresponsive not only to voice but also to pain. The neurology service evaluated him and he essentially has no hope of meaningful recovery.

He was in his USOH until three days ago when nursing staff noticed that he was more confused. Today, he was noted by staff to have high finger sticks (glucose > 500), urinary incontinence, and to be more confused, with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 681**] mental status. He was given 22 units insulin and had a BP of 86/51. Per report, he had no fever, cough, headache, nausea, or emesis. . ------- Upon Transfer to the Floors: For full HPI, please refer to MICU H and P. Briefly, the patient is a 68 YO M with IgA MM, IDDM, CKD and schizophrenia admitted to the MICU on [**1-12**] for hypotension in the setting of altered mental status. He was found to have high-grade GNR bacteremia. A R IJ was placed and he was fluid resucitated. Her initially required norepinephrine for pressure support but was weaned off of presssors on [**2613-1-13**]. He was started on vanc and cefepime pending culture results. Vanc was stopped on [**1-14**] and he remains on cefepime. Sensitivities have just returned and the GNR appears to be sensitive to cipro. . The patient's ICU stay was complicated by rising creatinine, currently 4.4, from a baseline of 1.5. He has been seen by renal. Urine sediment revealed muddy [**Known patient lastname **] casts consistent with ATN. As of the day of transfer, his urine output has increased to almost 4L in the past 24 hours. He has gotten 1L of fluids with bicarb as per renal suggestion due to low bicarb in the setting of ATN. . He has also been hyperglycemic requiring close glucose monitoring. . He reports feeling much improved and has no specific complaints at this time. He denies pain. His voice is difficult to understand and he reports being tired of everyone repeatedly examining him, making the interview somewhat limited. .

A CXR was negative for pna and a head CT was limited by motion but prelim negative. A UA was grossly positive and he was given vanc/ceftriaxone. SBPs drop to the 80s and he was given 5L IVF. A RIJ was placed with a CVP of 8, and he was also started on levophed and an insulin drip. He was then admitted to the MICU for further management. . On arrival to the floor, he is comfortable, A/O x 3, and requesting to return to his [**Hospital3 **] center.
57 year old male with history of EtOH and HCV cirrhosis (genotype 1, treatment-naive) complicated by ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, with most recent EGD in [**2729**] showing no varices, as well as seizure disorder, polysubstance abuse on methadone, with recent admission for hepatic encephalopathy, now referred from his PCP's office for hyperkalemia and acute renal failure. He admits that he is often noncompliant with her medications, and is almost completely reliant on his sister [**Name (NI) **] to administer them (he can't even say which meds he's on). His last admission ([**9-4**] - [**2731-9-10**]) was notable for hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury, and encephalopathy. He underwent large volume paracentesis (4.7L), from which the peritoneal fluid grew GPCs and he was treated with vancomycin for 48 hours until cultures returned showing one bottle growing peptostreptococcus (believed to be a contaminant).  Antibiotics were discontinued at that time and he had no further signs of infection for the remainder of his hospital stay. His acute kidney injury was thought to be related to hypovolemia from overdiuresis, improved with IV albumin. His hyperkalemia was treated with kayexylate and the hyponatremia improved with fluid restriction (132 on discharge). His hepatic encephalopathy resolved with lactlose. He was given ciprofloxacin 250mg daily for SBP prohpylaxis (given low peritoneal fluid protein) and spironolactone was decreased from 200 to 100mg + furosemide decreased from 80 to 40mg. Since discharge, patient has had 3 weekly, large volume paracenteses ([**9-15**] - 5L, [**9-24**] - 4.75L, [**9-28**] - 3L). He was seen by his PCP today who checked routine labs, which showed K+ of 6.8 along with acute kidney injury (creatinine of  he was referred to the ED for further management. In the ED, triage vitals were 96.7 73 109/65 20 97%. He was AAox3 and without complaints. Labs showed K 6.8, Na 121 (ranging 121-132 in past 20 days) Cr 1.9 (baseline ranging 0.9- 1.8 in past 20 days) INR 1.7, AST 47 ALT 89 tbili 1.4, Lactate 2.1. EKG reportedly had no peaked T waves, He was given calcium gluconate, dextrose + insulin, kayexelate, and 1L IV NS.  His blood glucose dropped and he started having terrible muscle cramps, requiring morphine and lorazepam to calm him down.  He is being admitted to the ICU after he received too much insulin and concern for hypoglycemia. On arrival to the MICU, he is awake, oriented, but sleepy.  His muscle cramps are much improved and he is having lots of diarrhea.  His electrolytes have started to normalize.
[**Known patient firstname **] [**Known patient lastname 4350**] is an 82-year-old male with history of end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, peptic ulcer disease, hypertension, SVT and triple A who presented with right upper quadrant pain, right flank pain, nausea, retching and decreased appetite. Three days prior to admission after his routine dialysis, he noted some shakes and later that day he noted some right upper quadrant pain that was intermittent.  Associated symptoms included right flank pain, nausea, retching and decreased appetite with poor oral intake.  The pain was not associated with eating or position.  He describes no previous episodes that were similar to this.  At his scheduled dialysis on the day of admission, the dialysis center was unable to access his catheter.  Of note, on [**3111-6-12**] he was admitted to [**Hospital1 1998**] for line sepsis with MSSA and treated with Vanc and Gent and then switched to Nafcillin for 6 weeks, despite a TEE that was negative for vegetation. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for headache, visual changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, PND, orthopnea, diarrhea, change in color of stool, rashes or skin changes.  He does complain of chronic constipation and longstanding decreased sensation in his lower extremities.
This is an 83 year old male with multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis who had initially presented on [**5-6**] at Hemodialysis with decreased p.o. intake and one week of cough productive of clear sputum.  In Hemodialysis, the patient was also noted to be rigoring, at which time blood cultures were drawn and the patient was subsequently sent home.  At home, the patient experienced generalized weakness and so presented to the Emergency Department. In the Emergency Department, initial vital signs were a temperature of 103.0 F.; heart rate 88; blood pressure 94/68; respiratory rate 20; pulse oximetry 96% on room air. Emergency Department work-up revealed a slight left shift without elevated white blood cell count and a left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray.  The patient was treated in the Emergency Department with Vancomycin 1 gram and Gentamicin 100 mg given his history of prior Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus line sepsis. The patient experienced an episode of hypotension to 64/40 in the Emergency Department, which was asymptomatic (normal mentation).  The patient was bolused one liter of normal saline and systolic blood pressure increased appropriately to 107.  Per the patient, his baseline blood pressure is 90 to 100 systolic, and generally 85 systolic following hemodialysis. The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the Emergency Department for relative hypotension and concern for sepsis.  On arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, temperature was 99.2 F.; heart rate 66; blood pressure 94/36; respirations 15; pulse oximetry 95% on room air and the patient was asymptomatic. The Medical Intensive Care Unit course was notable for the addition of Levofloxacin to the patient's antibiotic regimen for atypical organism coverage in the setting of community acquired pneumonia.  The patient did not receive any further doses of Vancomycin or Gentamicin following the Emergency Department visit.  Levofloxacin was dosed q.o.d. given the patient's renal failure and at the time of discharge, the patient had received a total of 3 doses. By report, culture data from hemodialysis on [**5-6**] showed no growth from blood cultures.  Admission blood cultures at [**Hospital1 69**] have shown no growth to date. The patient remained hemodynamically stable in the Medical Intensive Care Unit without further hypotensive episodes.  He was continued on amiodarone for his atrial fibrillation and Coumadin for anti-coagulation in the setting of atrial fibrillation.  His INR was noted to be subtherapeutic at 1.5 on admission. A Renal consultation was obtained and the patient was dialyzed on hospital day number three.  Also on hospital day number three, the patient was transferred to the ACOVE Service for continued care. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, the patient noted a minimally productive cough.  The patient had a good appetite. No shortness of breath, chest pain, back pain, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting diarrhea, black or bloody stools, dysuria, headache.  The patient was feeling his baseline on transfer to the ACOVE Service.

This is an 84-year-old man with multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, previous hypertension, atrial fibrillation, peptic ulcer disease, recently status post left below the knee amputation from [**4-10**] and discharged from [**Hospital1 **] on [**4-14**], and was transferred to rehab. He returned to us on [**4-14**] because of increased shortness of breath and hypoxia, and was slightly obtunded.  The patient had dialysis on [**4-14**] and he was initially sating 96% on 2 liters.  In the Emergency Department, he was given a dose of ceftriaxone and Levaquin for a pneumonia and left pleural effusion that was drained 800 cc of fluid. Postthoracentesis, his saturations went up to 96-97%.  He did have a small pneumothorax as a complication of this procedure.  However, then his oxygen saturations fluctuated in the low 90s.  His blood pressure transiently dropped to systolic blood pressure 75, which responded to fluid boluses. In the Emergency Department, it was discussed with Renal, there was no need to dialyze at that time.  He was evaluated by Surgery for his left below the knee amputation which appeared to be healing well as per Surgery.
55 year-old female with recently diagnosed stage IIIA fallopian tube adenocarcinoma who presented to oncology clinic complaining of ongoing nausea, vomiting, and weakness. She received her first cycle of chemotherapy consisting of intravenous Taxol and carboplatin on [**2653-11-23**], and last week received her second cycle consisting of intravenous Taxol and intraperitoneal cisplatin, followed by aggressive antiemetics with dolasetron, Emend, and compazine.  Ever since her recent chemotherapy, she has had some abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and was feeling tired.  She has not been able to keep any food down, but has been tying to drink Boost and Ensure as tolerated. She has not had any diarrhea.  She describes also intermittent fevers/chills at home, without any headache, change in vision, chest pain, SOB, excessive thirst or urination, or change in her bowel habits. In oncology clinic she was found to be dehydrated, with a serum sodium in the 108 range and potassium in the low 2 range, and is admitted for further management. . In the ED she was afebrile, with normal vital signs, and a normal mental status exam (per her husband). She was given IV normal saline, potassium replacement, and was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for further management.  The patient's sodium improved with normal saline. The etiology of her hyponatremia and hypokalemia was unclear but was possibly secondary to SIADH, exacerbated by dehydration and electrolyte loss (vomiting), or secondary to a component of Fanconi's syndrome. Hypertonic saline and democycline were not necessary. The patient's cortisol stimulation test and TSH were within normal limits. Celexa was discontinued due to its association with SIADH. The patient's IVF were discontinued at noon the day of transfer to the OMED floor with sodium improving to 128 and normalization of her potassium.
The patient is a 66-year-old female who was initially admitted on [**3053-11-10**], complaining of increased weakness and groin pain since nine days prior to admission when she had a fall.  Since the fall, the patient had been basically confined to her bedroom, did not drink or eat, and lived on some water, coffee, cigarettes and occasional beer.  According to her family, the patient had been not very mobile for some time prior to admission, mostly because of severe exertional dyspnea.  However, despite her dyspnea, she continued to smoke two packs of cigarettes per day. On admission, the patient denied any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, chest pain.
This is a 68-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of right upper lobe pneumonia, status post prolonged intubation with trache and PEG placements from [**3052-11-22**] to [**3053-12-23**], full exercise tolerance at baseline, chronic productive cough with thick-clear sputum, but otherwise not on home O2 or po prednisone, who has been in her usual state of health until about a week prior to admission when she started to experience increased fatigue, and shortness of breath, and productive cough.  But otherwise no fevers, chills, no overt upper respiratory infection, urinary tract infection, or abdominal symptoms. Two days prior to admission, her family noticed a dramatic worsening of shortness of breath and increased sputum production, but otherwise no change in the color or blood in the sputum.  She also had significant worsening of appetite for two days.  She fell at home the day prior to admission due to extreme weakness.  She was on the floor for about 15 minutes, but no loss of consciousness.  She was brought into the Emergency Room by her family. Her head CT scan was negative for hemorrhage.  Her shortness of breath was much better with nebulizers and IV steroids. However, the next day while she was still in the Emergency Room, she was noticed to have increased lethargy, and was electively intubated for an arterial blood gas of pH 7.24, pCO2 84, and pO2 of 73.  She became significantly hypotensive after intubation and required 10 liter normal saline resuscitation.  She was started on Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support.  She was given a dose of levofloxacin and Vancomycin for empiric coverage of possible sepsis.  Her chest x-ray and chest CT scan in the Emergency Department suggested right upper lobe pneumonia or other processes.
The patient is a 57 year old female with multiple medical problems who presented with gangrene of the right lower extremity, required admission for pain control, intravenous antibiotics and ultimately for right below the knee amputation.
77 YO old male with PMH significant for DM, HTN, high chol, CAD s/p stents [**2568**], CHF, Afib s/p PPM [**2568**], CKD who presents to ED because of weakness and collapse at home.

Per her rehabilitation facility, the patient is usually responsive to her name and this evening became unresponsive to name. It is unclear her baseline mental status. There is no evidence of fever from rehabilitation records. Patient to altered to tell us her symptoms. In the ED, initial VS were: 86 84/40 18 100% 2L NC. CVL was placed in RIJ. Labs were notable for acute kidney injury (Cr 4.3 <- 1.2 on [**3466-8-28**]), leukocytosis with WBC 24.1 (up from recent baseline of 17) w/ 91% polys, no bands & HCO3 15. Transaminases, alk phos and lipase were elevated, however the specimen was hemolyzed which can falsely elevate these values. Lactate 2.3. Prelim read of CT head & abd/pelvis were negative for acute process. Patient received 3L lactated ringers as well as vancomycin 1g IV and zosyn 4.5mg IV empirically. While in the ED, patient's BPs were 90s/60s (EMS) -> 84/40s (on presentation) -> got 3L fluids with no change in BP -> 90s/40s -> started levophed gtt @ 0.09 & BPs increased to 100-107/43-52.

This is a 74 year old gentleman with a history of prostate cancer who presented in [**Month (only) 1082**] of last year with rectal bleeding.  Evaluation included a colonoscopy which showed an ulcerative lesion in the rectum. These were biopsied and showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The patient presents for curative resection.
The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with a history of rectal adenocarcinoma and is status post proctosigmoidectomy with coloanal anastomosis and loop ileostomy with multiple admissions for partial small-bowel obstructions who now presents with lightheadedness and vomiting. The patient was last discharged from this hospital on [**2614-6-3**] after a 1-week admission for a partial small-bowel obstruction.  This was his third documented episode of a partial small-bowel obstruction since his surgery in [**2614-2-2**].  The patient reports that he was doing well at the time of discharge with good oral intake.  Moreover, over that period time he had been told by both his urologist and his primary care physician to drink plenty of water to help with his prostatic hypertrophy. Then, over the next two to three days prior to admission, the patient reported a few episodes of lightheadedness, feeling that he might feel faint.  He denied any accompanying chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations.  This occurred when he was standing and ambulating and resolved with rest. Subsequently, this afternoon, he reports the onset of nausea with clear emesis times one (there were no coffee grounds or frank blood in the emesis).  With this, he called his primary care physician who instructed him to proceed to the Emergency Department.  He reports that his ostomy output has been more watery, but he is uncertain whether it has increased in volume. In the Emergency Department, he was noted to have serum sodium of 107; which was thought to explain his recent symptoms.  He was given two liters of normal saline without an improvement in his sodium.  Thereafter, the Renal Service was consulted, and the patient was started on 3% normal saline at 60 cc per hour; starting at around 7:30 p.m. on the day of admission.  He was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 328**] Intensive Care Unit about two hours later for further evaluation and treatment of his hyponatremia.
This is an 89 year old male with past medical history of diverticulosis and melanoma who presented with with altered mental status after a fall. The exact details of what happened are a bit unclear as patient is not able to give a full history but on [**2798-1-24**] the patient was shoveling snow when he sustained a fall and struck his head. He managed to get inside and call his daughter who came to check on him and found him very confused but able to speak with blood visible outside and inside the house. She brought the patient to the ED where he had head CT revealing intraparenchymal and subdural hemorrhages and neurosurgery was consulted. They recommended no acute neurosurgical management at the time. Patient was extremely confused and becoming less responsive at that time so he was emergently intubated for airway protection and admitted to the neurosurgery ICU. Of night, he had a CT of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis that night, which was remarkable for signs of aspiration as well as some free air in his abdomen. His abdominal exam was benign and surgery evaluated him feeling there were no signs of an acute surgical abdomen or need for intervention.

This is a 52 year old female with PMHx of hyperlipidemia who presents to the CCU tonight after her PCP sent her to [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency department for an enlarged heart on CXR. The patient's history begins about 5 weeks ago when she experienced left anterior chaest pain which woke her around 0500 that mornig.  Pain is worse with breathing and radiated into her left arm and left side of the neck.  She went to [**Hospital3 2693**] (which records were obtained) and had an MI workup including 2 sets of negative cardiac enzymes, a negative stress test, and an unremarkable echo.  She also with CT scan for r/o PE which found a 5 mm nodule in the RUL but not other findings.  Patient was discharged from the hospital with no clear diagnosis.  Prior to onset of symptoms, she denied any recent local or foreign travel or cough/cold symptoms. Patient continued to have chest pain over the next month. Earlier this week she started having fevers, chills, and night sweats.  Temperature taken at home was max 100.8.  She did experience some SOB and nausea, but no vomiting.  She presented to an OSH where she refused labs as she had already undergone workup and was discharged with a Zpack.  She noted continued symptoms and decided to see her PCP today who ordered a CXR and saw cardiomegaly, pleural and pericardial effusion and sent her to the ED. In the ED, initial vitals were 18:04 8 99.2 106 116/72 20 97%. She was having [**6-27**] pain worse while lying supine and relieved sitting upright.  Pt states pain in chest, neck, upper abdomen and upper back. Pt with some sob with exersion.  Patient given toradol IV and Zosyn, 1L NS, fentanyl.  Pulses done at bedside by cardiology fellow which revealed only 10 mmHg.

The paitent is a 43-year-old male with a longstanding history of HIV/AIDS who presented to the ED after a week long history of high grade fevers and worseing dyspnea with exertion. The patient was diagnosed in [**3470**] with HIV and has been on and off HAART therapy since that time. Most recently, he was on steady treatment for 3 years until this spring when he decided to take a self decided medication holiday. He reports he has not taken HAART medications in about 6 months. About 2-3 months ago the patient also started having watery diarrhea intermittently [**2-10**] times weekly. About one and a half weeks ago, he started noticing high fevers and night sweats. The diarrhea worsened and instead of having it on and off, it became constant. The fevers also continued to worsen and peaked at a temp of 103.6 today, the morning of his admission. Two days prior to admission he started noticing shortness of breath with simple tasks such s climbing a few stairs at home. He also describes a non-productive dry cough and some chest "tightness" associated with this increased work of breathing. He could barely walk from the kitchen back and forth to the couch due to his dyspnea. He has also noticed daily headaches. He denies neck stiffness/rigidity, photophobia or any new skin rashes. He describes some mild blurry vision when he would try to focus on [**Location (un) 1116**] but this would subside after a minute or so. He now complains of diffuse weakness and lightheadedness today. He denies any syncope. Of note, he has lost about 25 pounds over the last couple months which he attributes to a decreased appetite and his diarrhea issues. . In the ED, initial vitals were T 99.4, BP 97/56, P 98, R 22, 85% on RA with only a slight improvement to 91% on 2L. The patient received 1000 mg IV  Vancomycin, 750 mg PO Levofloxacin, and 40 mg oral [**Location (un) 2723**]. He was ordered for Pentamidine 225 mg but did not receive it in the ED. An ABG was done and showed a low pO2 of 72. CXR showed multiple small patchy opacities bilaterally which were immediately concerning for PCP. . On the floor, the patient continued to feel short of breath. He was eventually comfortable on [**4-13**] L NC O2 but noticed he got very winded walking to and from the bathroom. He denied any nausea, vomiting. No abdominal pain. No diarrhea on day of admission. He still felt weak "all over" and had diffuse muscle aches. No headaches on arrival to floor. The patient had an acute exacerbation of his shortness of breath with associated tachypnea and tachycardia soon after admission to the medical floor. This acute episode of respiratory distress was soon after an induced sputum sample and thus, likely due to associated bronchospasms. The patient was hypoxic on labs and was therefore transferred to the MICU for a brief one day stay in order to watch his airway closely while he improved. Fortunately, he improved significantly following nebulizer treatments and high flow supplemental oxygen. He did not require any intubations. He was transferred back to the general medical floor once he was more hemodynamically stable and breathing comfortably on 4L oxygen via nasal cannula with oxygen saturations >95% consistently.

The patient is a 51 year old male with no significant past medical history other than hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL and tobacco abuse, who presents with ST elevation myocardial infarction. The morning of admission he woke up at 6:15 a.m. and felt unwell with mild upper chest discomfort at rest.  He had no dyspnea on exertion, nor shortness of breath.  He went to work, had continued discomfort, and at noon developed frank upper chest pain with radiation to both arms, mild dyspnea, though no nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis. He was brought to the [**Hospital1 69**] where electrocardiogram showed inferior ST segment elevation and he was transferred emergently to cardiac catheterization. He was enrolled in the Cool Myocardial infarction Study and randomized to the cooling arm. Left heart catheterization showed discrete 100% lesion at the right coronary artery with timi one flow.  Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed and 3.5 by 13 millimeter stent was employed following which repeat percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed. Repeat angiography showed residual stenosis proximal to the stent.  Therefore, repeat percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was done and repeat angiography done showed complete resolution of the lesion.  He also had a 70% lesion at the second obtuse marginal that was not treated.  Left ventriculogram showed inferior hypokinesis and ejection fraction of 42%, normal aortic and mitral valves.  The right heart catheterization showed mean right atrial pressure of 16, pulmonary artery pressure of 49/25 and a mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 15.  The patient was transiently bradycardic and Atropine was given with good results.  He was admitted to the CCU in order to continue the cool myocardial infarction protocol.

The patient recently history is notable for non-compliance both when she is oriented and when she is not.  She refuses UA evalaution and also refuses suprapubic care.  It is not clear when the last time her supr-pubic cath was changed.  Starting the day of admission, the patient was incoherent, was unable to swallow her pills and was salivating. she was deemed usafe to be at her home and was sent to the ED and [**Hospital1 **]. . The patient arrived to the ED and was intially minimally responsive.  Per the ED reports she improved while there from a MS perspective.  They did an I and D of the area around her SP cath and it was sent for culture which showed GPC in  pairs and GPR.  BC and Urine cultures were sent.  The patient HCT showed nothing acute and her CXR was wnl.  The patient was given levofloxacin and sent to the floor.
The patient is a 32 year-old woman with a recurrent demyelinating illness brought to the Emergency Room by her parents on the recommendation of her neurologist for evaluation of behavior changes including increased sexual promiscuity, increased spending and report that she is compulsively wanting to have sexual activity and unable to control it to the degree that she is placing herself and her parents at risk.  She has contact[**Name (NI) **] many men by computer and phone.

The father called the police and the police knew him to be a dangerous the patient left the house unbeknown to the parents and was waiting outside for a cab to take her to a motel where she had arranged a liaison with the same man.  The father stated he had also escorted other strange men out of the house and is very worried about the patient and the families safety. She also has had increased spending and has had a progressive decline in her ability to care for herself including decreased ambulation.  The other stresses beside her declining physical abilities was that her fiance who was bipolar committed suicide by jumping in front of a train in [**3496-2-7**].  On [**3496-5-28**] she was seen by a neurologist and an MRI was ordered.  The patient was then referred for evaluation for psychiatric admission for behavioral control. PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  Admission to [**Hospital1 188**] in [**3491-3-7**] for a psychotic disorder with hallucinations secondary to prescribed steroids.  In [**3486**] she was seen by a psychiatrist when her neurological illness was first diagnosed and she started to exhibit disinhibited behavior and impulsiveness with late night phone calls.  Her neuropsychologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3037**].
48 y/o M with PMH of HIV/AIDS, last CD4 13 [**7-29**] and VL 51,000 [**4-29**], candidal esophagitis, peripheral neuropathy who presents after being found down in his apartment.  He was brought in my EMS and intubated in ED due to combativeness and altered mental status. Further history unable to be obtained from patient or HCP who was unable to be reached. . In the ED VS were rectal T 91 F, BP 104/palp, HR 60, RR 16.  He was given etomidate and rocuronium pre-intubation and placed on propofol gtt.  He was given 2L NS and 2L LR as well as 1gm IV vancomycin and 2gm ceftriaxone.  Toxicology was consulted and recommended charcoal 50gm.  he was placed on a bear hugger and rectal temp came up to 93.  He was transferred to the ICU for further care. On arrival to ICU VS were stable. He was placed under warming blanket and arterial line was placed.
The patient is a 39-year-old female with end-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes. She also has a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and hypothyroidism who presented with chest pain. The patient felt chest pressure while walking and had associated shortness of breath and emesis.  She did have relief with rest.  On admission, she did also note that her blood sugars were running higher than normal.  She did have a stress test five years ago as a possibility for transplant option which was normal. In the Emergency Department, the patient was given aspirin, ceftriaxone, Lopressor, and was chest pain free.
Patient is a 39 yo male with pmhx HIV (unknown cd4, viral load)on HAART brought in by police after being found down behind a dumpster. No records available in computer and ED thinks that pt gets most of his care at [**Hospital1 2148**]. Neurology was initially consulted for altered mental status which they attributed to toxic/metabolic issues, etoh intoxication, UTI but recommended that if he continued to have altered sensorium and not clear appropriately to consider LP for CNS infection and MRI to r/o toxo, PML, etc. Head CT was negative. Serum etoh was 229 and he had an anion gap of 39 on presentation to the ED. He was going to be admitted to the floor, but the floor team asked for additional studies to work up his anion gap and he was found to have a lactate of 8. He was given broad spectrum abx including vancomycin, levaquin and ceftriaxone. Toxicology was consulted and recommended checking an osm gap which was 79 by my calculation. Toxicology recommended giving IVF and if the lactate  and osmolar gap improved with fluid, then it was unlikely to be due to ethylene glycol or methanol intoxication. After 5 liters of IV NS, lactate decreased from 8-->5. Repeat osm pending currently.  During his ED course, patient was noted to become tremulous and taccycardic and was thought to be undergoing withdrawl. He was given a total of 20 mg valium and 2 mg ativan. His cks were also checked and found to be significantly elevated > 6000 and he was given approx 5 liters ns (one of the liters was bannana bag). He was then transferred to the ICU for further management. . In the ED, his initial vs were: T 97.8 P 88 BP 148/90 RR 18 O2 sat 100% RA. He was given acyclovir, ceftriaxone, levaquin, vancomycin. Blood and urine cx were not drawn prior to these antibiotics. He also received valium po 20 mg and 2 mg IM ativan as well as 5 liters IV NS and bananna bag. On presentation to the ICU, his initial vs were: T 97.2 P 124 BP 124/66 RR 17 O2 sat 99% RA. He reported feeling dehydrated, dizzy, mild headache, whole body feels stiff including neck, pain in legs from sunburn. Denies cp, sob, abd pain.

Upon seeing her primary care physician for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] routine office visit, she was found to have a blood pressure of 190/140 with 4+ protein on urinalysis and was sent to the Emergency Department.  Her headache was present at the time, and she reported being mildly short of breath.  She denied any other signs or symptoms of end organ damage from hypertension including visual changes, chest pains, nausea, vomiting, any abdominal pain. In the Emergency Department, she was given nitroprusside which dropped her pressure rapidly.  She was admitted to the CCU where she was begun on a labetalol drip.  Her blood pressure responded appropriately with a decrease of about 20-25% at which time she was changed to po labetalol and transferred to the floor. At the time of transfer, she was in no acute distress, had no complaints of headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath. Her constipation and urinary symptoms had resolved. Past medical history includes obesity, hypertension, chronic headaches, depression. Past surgical history includes left tibiofibular fracture with rod placement and she was status post right ankle fracture and repair. ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Depo Provera although she missed her last dose which would have been in [**Month (only) 213**]. MEDICATIONS AT TIME OF TRANSFER:  Labetalol 400 mg po tid, albuterol and Atrovent MDIs prn, sliding-scale insulin, and Tylenol prn. FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother is deceased.  She had hypertension and end-stage renal disease.  Father has coronary heart disease. SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smokes 1.5 to 1 pack per day and drinks alcohol only socially. On examination at the time of transfer, temperature max was 98, heart rate 89-96, blood pressure ranging from 130-170/72/101.  In general she was very pleasant, alert and oriented times three, an obese African-American female.  On HEENT examination, her pupils were equal and reactive. Ophthalmoscope was not available at the time, but I was told by the CCU resident that she did not have papilledema.  Her neck was supple without bruit or thyromegaly.  Heart examination was regular.  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Her abdominal examination was obese, but soft and nontender.  She had normoactive bowel sounds.  No abdominal bruit was heard and there was no costovertebral angle tenderness. PERTINENT LABORATORIES:  Her complete blood count revealed a hematocrit of 36.2.  Urinalysis again had 4+ protein, though at the time of transfer, there was no protein in the urine. Chem-7 was significant for hypokalemia reaching a low point of 2.9.  Creatinine was 1.6 up from her baseline of 1 in [**Month (only) 541**] of this year.  LFTs were within normal limits, and the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction with enzymes x3. Hemoglobin A1C was 5.7.  TSH was 3.0.  Cholesterol panel revealed a LDL of 124, HDL of 45, and triglycerides of 211. Her cortisol was 15.  Urine drug screen was negative. HOSPITAL COURSE:  Hypertension:  At the time of transfer from the CCU, a significant workup had already begun for possible causes of secondary hypertension including renal artery stenosis, hyperaldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, [**Location (un) 3434**] disease, and hypothyroidism.  Laboratories were sent for all of these including renin level, aldosterone level, 24-hour
This is an 84 year-old male with a relatively early staged stomach cancer in the distal region.  Work-up has been negative for metastatic disease.  He does have some lymph node enlargement in his mediastinum, but those nodes were biopsy negative and FDG negative.  He presented this admission for subtotal gastrectomy. He has known significant aortic stenosis without symptoms.  The valve area is quite tight at 0.8 sq cm, but function is preserved. Surgery was scheduled for [**2918-12-6**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Patient is a 36 yo male with a history of cerebral palsy, epilepsy, aspiration, aphasia who was previously diagnosed with right lower lobe pneumonia on [**3418-9-2**] and completed a 10 day course of levofloxacin. However, he was brought to ED by group home staff on [**3418-10-5**] with fevers to 101 and productive cough - unclear if white or yellow phlegm. The patient was febrile in the ED with a WBC of 18.8 and placed on Levo/Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia with CXR showing persistent cavitary RLL pneumonia with effusion. He was found to have a lung abscess and treated with IV Levo/Clinda.
The patient is a 39 year old male, baseline nonverbal with mental retardation, cerebal palsy, seizure disorder, history of recurrent aspirations on a modified diet who presented to the ED on [**6-17**] from his [**Hospital **] nursing home with seizure x 2 on day of presentation ( 7 pm, 8:15 pm) with a fever to 102. Status post seizure, the patient was found to be hypoxic to 89% on RA per EMS report. His seizure spontaneously resolved. The patient has a history of multiple aspirations in the past. [**Name (NI) **] HCP, sister, [**Name (NI) **] requested no central lines, LP or femoral stick. . In the ED, a CXR was obtained which showed no evidence of infiltrate. His temperature in the ED was 103.8 for which he was given tylenol. Given a concern for aspiration, the patient was given vanco 1 gm, ceftriaxone 2 gm, and flagyl. His pulse was noted to be up to 146, BP 152/98 and he was sat'ing 100@ liters ->96-99% on RA. . A dilantin level was checked in the ED and was 12.6. A valproic acid level was subtherapeutic at 37. He was given 2 mg IV ativan in the ED given his recent seizure. His WBC was elevated at 12.4. A UA was checked which was negative for signs of infection. A lactate was checked and was 3.7->4.4. . An EKG was checked which showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 141 bpm. No acute ischemic changes. He received a total of 2 liter IVFs with a net I/O of 1.4 liters positive. . The patient is documented as being DNR/DNI and the patient's sister [**Name (NI) 378**] asked that no femoral sticks, central lines, or other aggressive measures be pursued. He was admitted to the ICU given his tachycardia and elevated lactate as it was felt he would trigger on the floor. . ROS: . Unable to obtain.
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with h/o Parkinson's, aspiration pneumonia who presented to [**Hospital1 **] ER from NH with acute SOB. He initially had fever to 102 axillary and rigors at his NH and was brought in by EMS. EN route to [**Hospital1 **], his RR was elevated and he presented there in respiratory distress, febrile to 103 and hypertensive to 160s/100. They treated him with nebs and lasix and his resp status improved. CXR revealed LLL infiltrate and U/A was grossly positive, with >100 WBC. He was given zosyn, ceftriaxone and levaquin. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] per request of his wife. She notes he has been more fatiqued, denies myalgias. He has had some episodes of dyspnea and increased RR at the NH for past few days, which seemed to respond to roxanol, per his wife. [**Name (NI) **] notes some dysuria and productive cough, denies chest pain, back pain, couging with eating. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he had temp of 100.8, BP 84/52, RR 24, os sat 100 % on NRB. His ABG was 7.35/53/174 on the NRB. His baseline sats are mid 90's on RA.
[**Age over 90 **]yo man with h/o Parkinson's disease, multiple prior admissions for aspiration pneumonia most recently [**3264-4-21**], who presents again from [**Hospital 99**] Rehab after the staff there had "trouble waking him up" this AM, and found him to be in mixed respiratory failure. On the prior admit, the pt was diagnosed with a LLL pna and treated with vancomycin/zosyn. Per his wife, the patient was doing relatively well last week, still in the MACU at [**Hospital 99**] Rehab since his recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] but with a plan to transition to the regular floor soon. His ABG on [**3264-5-14**] was 7.34/69/55 on room air, which is close to his baseline pCO2. On Saturday 2d PTA, the pt's wife noted that he was congested more than baseline, initially unable to cough, but then improved after neb treatments with the production of brown-pink secretions.  He had hyperglycemia to FS 223, which per wife he has never had before (no h/o DM). By Saturday night though he was doing well, less congested and speaking clearly. Then, Sunday AM, he was congested again and though he received nebs he was not able to cough out the secretions. Per the Pulmonologist note from Sunday PM, he was then found to be poorly arousable, with RR 30, shallow breathing, lungs clear, O2 sat 90% on pulse oximeter. ABG performed, 7.20/107/44, O2 sat 68% on ABG, presumably on room air though unclear. BIPAP was written for (IPAP 16, EPAP 3), though it is not clear if this was started. He was shortly thereafter intubated after the Pulmonologist confirmed his Full Code status with the pt's wife. After intubation, it was noted that he had copious thick yellow secretions in his trachea, which were felt to be the culprit causing obstruction and hypercarbia/hypoxemia. With suctioning his breathing improved, and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work up. The patient remained awake the whole time. He was noted to have a temp of 100.4F this AM. . Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he appeared to be in no respiratory distress. His initial ABG was 7.34/67/315. He was found to be febrile to 100.4F, with HR 60s-70s, SBPs ranged 60s-80s. His CXR was concerning to the ED staff for RUL/RLL processes (though appears to have only persistent LLL , and he was given CTX, Vanc, and Flagyl out of concern for nosocomial vs. aspiration pna. His urine was leuk esterase (+) on UA, culture pending. Blood cultures were also sent. He received 1L NS for hypotension, and subsequently his pressures were still low so he was started on a dopamine drip via a newly-placed RIJ (per report, sterile placement via ultrasound in the ER). He also had a 18G PIV placed, and has a PICC line from [**Hospital **] Rehab that is of unclear age or indication (felt to be from prior need for IV abx). His ECG was notable for Q-wave in V1, ST elevations laterally, concerning for ischemia. TnT 0.10, CK 22, MB not done. Lact 0.6. He was given ASA 325mg PR. His wife confirmed that he is full code.

Per report, patient was found to open eyes but otherwise not responding to verbal commands. ABG done at rehab showed marked hypercarbia (pCO2 100) and patient was referred urgently to the ED. . In the Emergency Department, patient was intubated for presumed hypercarbic respiratory failure. ABG was not done on admission. CXR did not show any acute changes from ED visit 3 days prior (he had presented to ED on [**3264-7-8**] with dyspnea, respiratory status had returned to baseline, CXR was unchanged, and labs did not reveal leukocytosis). He was given Vanc/Levo/Flagyl for possible sepsis, albuterol/atrovent for bronchodilation, and methylprednisolone for ? assumed COPD exacerbation given hypercarbia. . In discussing history and events with wife, she noted that patient appeared more lethargic than normal today, with some confusion. At baseline, patient is AO x 2, occasionally disoriented to place and sundowns at night, but otherwise is able to carry on normal daily conversations with her. During prior hypercarbic episodes, wife reported that patient's speech becomes softer and non-sensical, which she reported was occurring throughout the day today. At 3 PM, she reports that patient became very somnolent, and she sought immediate

This is a 73-year-old male who had a history of coronary artery disease and had underwent a left internal mammary artery H grafted with a radial artery to the left anterior descending artery through a left anterior thoracotomy many years ago. He had progressive shortness of breath and was found to have critical aortic stenosis with aortic valve area of 0.8 cm squared and moderate mitral regurgitation. His ejection fraction was estimated to be about a 25%. He also underwent a cardiac catheterization which demonstrated that his H graft to the left anterior descending artery was patent. He had a totally occluded left anterior descending artery proximally. He also had significant stenosis of his left circumflex artery and right coronary artery. It was recommended that he undergo a coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic valve replacement, and possible mitral valve repair/replacement. After the risks and benefits were explained to the patient he agreed to proceed.

The patient stated that he was golfing roughly four days prior to admission and had episodes of left sided chest pains which radiated to the shoulder and arm. The patient, on [**3021-9-5**], presented to an Emergency Room for rule out myocardial infarction and the myocardial infarction was ruled out with enzymes and electrocardiogram.  On [**3021-9-6**], the patient started exercising, had increased chest pains for roughly seven minutes, which resolved.  The patient was then worked up for a myocardial infarction once again and was transferred to a Catheterization Lab for possible angioplasty.
This 61 year-old male with a ten year history of progressive Parkinson's disease tripped over his own feet and fell down approximately seven steps.  He states for a few seconds he was stunned and felt tingling in all four extremities.  He also noted pain in his legs left greater then right and in his right chest.  He was taken to [**Hospital **] Hospital where he was reportedly neurologically intact.  He was in a cervical collar.  A CT scan of the cervical spine was obtained.  This showed a fracture of the anterior arch of C1.  There was a moderately displaced, comminuted, odontoid fracture extending through the base, which moderately narrowed the spinal canal.  The dens and C1 were displaced approximately 13 mm.  The patient was able to void spontaneously times two before a Foley catheter was placed.  The patient has been followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in Neurology for his movement disorder.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname 3707**] is a 52-year-old female who was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] in hyperacute fulminant liver failure thought to be secondary to either Bactrim reaction versus acetaminophen toxicity. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit initially and became progressively obtunded, with significant encephalopathy requiring intubation and ventilatory support. Her liver function was notable for transaminases with an ALT and AST of 9500 and 17,500 respectively and worsening hyperbilirubinemia. She became progressively more coagulopathic, and it was thought that she was most likely going to need orthotopic liver transplantation for survival. Given the critical nature of her illness, she was transferred to the transplant surgical service and to the surgical intensive care unit for further management. This management initially entailed aggressive control and monitoring of intracranial pressures in conjunction with the neurosurgical service. This required placement of an intracranial bolt and aggressive volume management with the use of hypertonic saline and mannitol. She continued to receive aggressive cardiopulmonary support with again, as noted, full ventilatory support and vasopressor support for hypotension. COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  Neurologically, as noted above the patient required placement of an intracranial bolt for ICP monitoring. Her ICPs had climbed into the high 30s. This was managed with hyperventilation and usage of mannitol and hypertonic saline. Over the course of the next 4-5 days as her liver function improved, her intracranial pressures decreased. Her sedation and paralytics were weaned. She had removal of her intracranial bolt on [**3396-10-11**], and it was noted on subsequent imaging that she had approximately a 4-cm, right frontal, intracranial hemorrhage. This was followed serially with CT scans and there was no progression of the bleeding. The bleeding was thought to be secondary to her severe coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia in the setting of her instrumentation. She was started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis to finish a 10-day course. On [**3396-10-17**], the patient was extubated and her neurologic exam was notable for response to voice and opening of her eyes. She was moving her left upper extremity and her right lower extremity with 2/5 strength and had minimal movement in her right upper extremity and left lower extremity, not following the predicted neurologic pattern if this was a deficit associated with her intracranial bleeding. In terms of her respiratory status, it is noted that the patient required full ventilatory support and was extubated on [**3396-10-17**]. She initially did well, but, secondary to what was thought to be pulmonary edema, required reintubation on [**3396-10-18**] after failure of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. She had some degree of what appeared to be an ARDS-type reaction or transfusion- associated lung injury requiring high amounts of PEEP and oxygenation during the initial days of her intensive care unit stay. This resolved over the course of the next several days with diuresis and supportive therapy. In terms of her cardiovascular status, the patient initially had blood pressure support with the use of vasopressors in order to minimize her intravascular volume which was thought to exacerbate her cerebral edema. The vasopressors were weaned by ICU day 6, and there was no further requirement for this. There were no significant dysrhythmias. The patient, initially thought to most certainly require liver transplantation, spontaneously improved in terms of her liver function over the course of her 2 weeks in the intensive care unit. This was evidenced by progressive ability to metabolize her lactate, stabilization of her blood sugars, and autocorrection of her coagulopathy. By the time of her transfer, while she continued to have a hyperbilirubinemia, her transaminases had completely normalized. A Dobbhoff feeding tube was in place for post- pyloric tube feedings. The patient's transaminases were elevated; this was thought to be secondary to a possible mild ischemic pancreatitis which might have developed during her requirement for vasopressors. She otherwise did not seem to be symptomatic for this and was tolerating tube feeds. Therefore, this was not aggressively pursued. In terms of her overall fluid status, her baseline weight is 37 kg. On the day of transfer, she weighed about 44 kg. This volume overload was being managed with hemodialysis daily on an as-needed basis. The patient's renal function, which had
Pt is a 52F with OCD (stable recently, but h/o OD, anorexia and alcohol use in past), ileostomy, GERD with delayed gastric emptying, who presented to [**Hospital3 3711**] on [**10-2**] with nausea and dizziness. There she was initially dx'd with dehydration, ARF and UTI but then found to have ALT of 25,370 and of AST 11,490, total bili of 2.0, INR of 4.0, Cr of 3.0. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. . She had been having fevers for ~10 days. On [**9-27**] she went to her PCP who diagnosed [**Name Initial (PRE) **] UTI (grew klebsiella) and was taking Bactrim. She continued to have general malaise and fevers despite bactrim and asa. On [**10-2**] she called her PCP who recommended some tylenol. Per husbands report she took 650mg x2 before coming in to the ED on [**10-2**]. There she was initially dx'd with dehydration, ARF and UTI. She was given home doses of simvastatin and SSRIs, but then found to have ALT of 25,370 and of AST 11,490, total bili of 2.0, INR of 4.0, Cr of 3.0. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. On presentation initial vs were: 97.5 P89, 112/37 19 99%RA 37kg. . (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.

51M w/ hx of depression, remote suicide attempts and OCD presented to ED on [**11-20**] with c/o being nonconversant. He was being weaned off abilify over the past 3 weeks due to "drowsiness", and 3 days ago the patient's mother, with whom he lives, noticed that he was pacing the floor, a behavior that is unusual for him, but otherwise was at his baseline which is fully functional and independent in ADLs. The next morning however he became nonconversant and minimally responsive to verbal commands. After contacting his psychiatrist, his mother brought the patient to the [**Name (NI) **] for evaluation. . In the ED, initial VS were: 97.8 70 158/90 18 96RA . He was evaluated by psychiatry who felt his symptoms were due to aquired catatonia in the setting of a mood disorder and weaning off abilify. They noted that in the ED he exhibited mutism, hypokinetic behavior, echolalia/echopraxia, posturing and decreased eye blink. He was placed on section 12 and bed search was initiated. However he became agitated yesterday afternoon when he was ready to be transferred to an outside facility. He was given ativan but eventurally required 4 point restraints. Restraints were kept in place overnight, removed this morning, but then replaced due to concern for fall risk as he would not remain in his bed. His CK was noted to be trending upward, and the ED requested that he be admitted to the MICU given possible need for ativan drip, rising CK, and high risk for NMS. . Last vitals in ED: 97.8 70 158/90 18 96%RA. Just prior to admission he was noted to be drowsy, with his last benzo dose of ativan 2mg, midazolam 5mg at 1130hrs, and total of 20mg ativan given during ED course. ED records noted his head CT was negative for hemorrhage, mediastinum appeared widened on AP CXR, and initial ECG showed sinus tachycardia with normal QTc interval. . On arrival to the MICU patient was conversant, but remained mildly agitated. . Review of systems: - Reviewed and negative except per HPI

This 79-year-old woman is admitted for respiratory distress, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.  This woman has had a complicated medical course over the past six months which has included several episodes of respiratory failure, difficulty to wean off a ventilator, tracheostomy placement complicated by tracheal tear (requiring open sternotomy), anasarca, atrial fibrillation, E.coli sepsis, pseudomonas urinary tract infection, VRE intraabdominal abscess and Clostridium difficile colitis.  Her ventilatory difficulties were thought to be perhaps secondary to a myopathic process, although muscle biopsy results were inconclusive and not demonstrative of inflammatory changes. Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**10-16**] through [**3461-12-5**] and successfully weaned from the ventilator there.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 5521**] [**3461-12-5**] where she was gradually reintroduced to p.o. feed and weaned from PEG feeds.  She currently tolerates a pureed diet.  Her atrial fibrillation has been managed via rate control as the Amiodarone she was previous on was felt to possibly contribute to her myopathy.  She had been on Lasix (40 mg b.i.d.) on transfer from [**Hospital1 **] and nonetheless gained 12 pounds from [**12-16**] through [**1-2**].  Lasix was decreased to 20 mg q. day on [**12-31**] because her sodium was noted to be 129. On [**1-2**], the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea and tachypnea.  She states she has had intermittent dry cough for several days.  No subjective fevers or chills. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] today with still more dyspnea / tachypnea, sodium of 126 and a potassium of 6.2.

The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a negative past medical history who, at 4:45 p.m. on the day of admission, complained of left-sided numbness and tingling.  At 5:15 p.m. she noted right upper quadrant numbness.  The patient picked up the phone and was unable to hold on to the phone.  She dropped the phone and then began having difficulty walking.  She was taken to [**Hospital3 3534**], and she was unable to walk once she got to [**Hospital3 3534**]. She had a head CT of the brain which showed a 3.5-cm right-sided mass with hyperintense ring enhancement and mild edema.
The patient is a 70 yo M with a hx of PE/DVT [**9-2**] whose anticoagulation was recently stopped [**4-9**] after a neg CTA and negative doppler study, who now presents with recurrent DVT/PE. He reports experiencing left sided lower extremity edema that has been present since his initial DVT presentation [**9-2**].  This became significantly work for the past 2 days, along with left foot pain.  He presented to [**Hospital3 **], where he was found to have an extensive DVT in the LLE and was given a dose of lovenox 100 mg at 0220 and coumadin 10 mg at 0200.  He also reportedly endorsed some discomfort and a CTA revealed a saddle PE.  He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Pt reports he is only minimally ambulatory due to "pinched nerves in the spine" that have been active for the past 2.5 years.  He has been even less active more recently, given that he experiences LLE radicular pain and SOB with any ambulation after about one minute. He does feel his SOB was particularly worse this past friday and believes his blood clots are related to his lack of ambulation. In the ED, initial VS were:  97.6 57 188/77 16 99% 2L Nasal Cannula.  Reportedly a bedside u/s showed no right heart strain. ECG showed did not show RHS, but did show old inferior and possible anterior infacts. Labs were notable for a proBNP of 565 and a negative trop. On arrival to the MICU, the patient states he feels uncomfortable, but this is due to his chronic radicular pain. He denies feeling chest discomfort, SOB, palpitations or dizziness.

Blood was ordered and liver service notified with plan to evaluate patient upon arrival to MICU. In the ED he received Vit K, FFP, PRBCs and protonix. . When patient came to floor was continuing to have bright red blood per OGT. Liver evaluated patient and felet that EGD would not be useful at this time as his INR was too high to intervene.
The patient is a 29-year-old female with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the Emergency Department with sepsis.  The patient was in her usual state of health until after her usual Monday hemodialysis session.  The session lasted three hours and was complicated by line thrombosis. Upon arriving home, she felt profoundly fatigued, was vertiginous, and had diffuse long bone pain, felt febrile, and was nauseated, and vomited once.  She also noted mild shortness of breath with mild pleuritic chest pain.  The patient took Tylenol with no relief. On the morning of [**2-27**], she presented to the Emergency Department and was found to have a blood pressure of 90/60, which was responsive to 1 liter of normal saline. The patient had generalized weakness and mild abdominal pain. A left external jugular central line was attempted, but became infiltrated and was removed with resulting hematoma.

The patient is an 81 year old Russian-speaking female with a history of HOCM s/p septal EtOH ablation in [**3499**], CHF EF >70%, nonobstructive CAD by cath '[**99**], mild dementia, CRI (baseline 1.9) , DMII who is admitted to the ICU on [**3503-3-2**] for suspected pneumosepsis. She had been recently hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 4941**] for a CHF exacerbation in the setting of poorly controlled hypertension. She was seen by cardiology who started her on lisinopril and HCTZ. On her day of discharge she was given a influenza vaccine which resulted in chills and myalgia but she was discharged home regardless. While at home she continued to have subjective fevers and chills but per her daughter she had no measurable temperature. She had worsening SOB despite taking all of her medications with a productive cough. She denied CP but did feel some chest tightness. She had poor appetite with mild nausea w/o vomiting, and denied abdominal pain or dysuria. At 11pm the night prior to admission, she could not even lay down to sleep so she called her daughter who called 911. In the ED she was hypertensive with SBP of 145 and her CXR was read as mild CHF, no pneumonia with a  pro-BNP of 13,431 (up from 4107 during her recent hospitalization). She was given 20mg IV lasix and dropped her SBP to the 85/54 from 142 with a fever to 100.5. A sepsis line was placed and she was given Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl for empiric ? aspiration PNA coverage. SBP improved to 100s with 500cc NS bolus so no vasopressors were initiated. The ED staff was also concerned about ST dep inf on ECG and started heparin gtt for ACS. Her EKG showed SR 70s, LVH, increased voltage, downward sloping ST segments V4-V6, I, AVL with TWI with 3 mm STE V1-V3 (old from [**3500**]). No Q waves. Troponin was 0.04-0.02 on admission. CK [**Telephone/Fax (3) 4942**] with an MB <10. She ruled out for an MI. She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] for further monitoring for sepsis. They felt she was overdiuresed in the emergency department and became tachycardic, which further exacerbated her tenuous baseline volume status. She was maintained euvolemic in the ICU. Her heart rate was controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol with a goal rate in the 60s. On the night of admission, she had a run of VT (60 beats?) with a right central line placement which resolved spontaneously. Her electrolytes were buffed, and the VT was thought to be secondary to stretch. Cardiology followed her throughout her [**Hospital Unit Name 152**] stay. She was started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin for a total of 14 days for pneumonia. She was also found to have a UTI which grew pansensitive Klebsiella and E. Coli on Cx, which were covered by her ceftriaxone. She was continued on aspirin, beat-blocker, statin. Her ACE was restarted on discharge from the ICU as her creatinine returned back to baseline. She was ruled out for MI with three sets of negative cardiac enzymes. Regarding her HOCM, she was maintained on diltiazem 30 mg QID, lopressor titrated up to 37.5 TID. She was transferred to [**Wardname 4943**] for HOCM ablation on Friday. At present, complains of shortness of breath and cough. Denies any chest pain/pressure. Underwent successful ETOH ablation of S1 on [**3503-3-13**] and transferred to CCU post-procedure with temporary pacing wire for close observation. The temp wire was removed without evidence of CHB on [**3503-3-15**] without events.

Per report from [**Hospital6 4949**], Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was admitted on [**3212-11-13**] with epigastric discomfort that subsequently developed into chest pain radiating to the jaw and left shoulder. Per the patient, he has been having intermittent abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomitting for approximately 2.5 weeks to 1 month. The abdominal pain is in the epigastrium, not associated with eating or with position and is non-radiating. The abdominal pain has resolved since being in the hospital. . On the evening of [**3212-11-13**], he reports that his abdominal pain, was accompanied by 8 out of 10 substernal chest pain. The chest pain radiated to his jaw and left shoulder. This pain lasted for approximately 1 hour and resolved in the ED at [**Hospital3 **]. He does not recall precipitating factors for this chest pain. But does report that his roommate informed him that he had "passed out" for an unknown period of time on this same evening. The patient does not recall this event. . At [**Hospital6 4949**], he was found to have a Utox positive for cocaine and benzos. From review of records, his cardiac markers were negative x 1, and it is unknown whether there were any EKG changes. Per report, he was advised to undergo a cardiac cath, but the patient was initially reluctant, until today, the patient finally became agreeable to the procedure. On cardiac cath at [**Hospital3 **], he was found to have 95% RCA, 90% LAD, and 90% LCx disease. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of his coronary disease, originally for plans for PCI. . On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] cath holding area, he reported having 5/10 chest pain. He was given SL NTG x 2, lopressor IV 5 mg x 1, and NTG gtt. He became hypotensive to SBP 60s and was given IVF NS 400cc which brought up his blood pressure to SBP 130s. He was restarted on NTG gtt for persistent chest pain. No EKG findings noted at the time. Per evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], he was transferred to the CCU with plans for CABG. He currently denies chest pain. He does report that he has [**8-21**] diffuse HA that started earlier today since being started on the nitro gtt. . On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Pt is a 64 year old woman with hx of breast CA, TIA's and CAD s/p CABG, and R cavernous carotid aneurysm s/p clipping, transferred from [**Hospital3 **] after having been found to have intracerebral hemorrhage. Last night around 7 pm she was alone at home (lives in a retirement community) and developed headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. She also had some diarrhea and thought that she had a viral illness. Went to bed, difficulty sleeping because of her vomiting. This morning she still felt dizzy and weak. Her son came to visit her later in the morning and noted a prominent R facial droop and slurred speech.

Patient is a 47 year-old male with polycystic kidney disease and impending renal failure. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a well-developed male in no acute distress. He is 268 pounds with a blood pressure of 133/86.  Heart rate is 106.  Neck is supple without masses. Heart is regular rate and rhythm with S1 and S2 clearly heard. No murmur, rub or gallop were appreciated.  His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His abdomen was soft, distended and the kidneys and liver are easily palpable bilaterally.  Bowel sounds are normal and present. Extremities are with 1 to 2+ edema bilaterally. LABORATORY DATA:  Hemoglobin is 10.8 with a hematocrit of 34.2.  His potassium is 5.2; BUN is 54 and creatinine is 4.7. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the operating room for an elective bilateral nephrectomy and right Perma- cath placement. He tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the postoperative care unit where he was noted to have postoperative potassium of 7.4.  It should also be noted that his bilateral kidneys, each kidney weighed about 35 pounds and the total amount of fluid loss during the procedure, secondary to removal of the kidneys, was estimated to be roughly 5 liters.  Renal was consulted in the PACU.  The patient was maintained intubated, at which time he was dialyzed to remove the potassium which was performed on postoperative day number zero. After the dialysis was completed, his potassium had dropped down to 6.0 and patient was being maintained at this time in the surgical intensive care unit.  On the morning of postoperative day number 1, the patient was extubated.  He did well.  He was also dialyzed again and this brought his potassium down on postoperative day number 2 to 4.7.  On postoperative day number 2, it was also noted that his hematocrit had dropped to 24 from a previous level of 30.5.  He was followed for this.  His value remained stable.  It was 25.2 on the following day.  By postoperative day number 3, pressors had been weaned off. The patient was tolerating clears.  On postoperative day number 4, the patient was transferred to the floor.  On postoperative day number 5, the patient was noted to be passing flatus and had 2 bouts of emesis on the previous evening while taking in clears.  The patient was made n.p.o. again.

The patient is a 50 year old right-handed man presenting with a few weeks of progressively worsening headache. He rarely has headaches (certainly no migraine or recurrent severe headaches), but he started having a headache after sustaining a head injury on [**2722-8-17**]. He was driving his car and was broad-sided on the passenger side, causing him to hit the left side of his head on the side window. He did not lose consciousness and was not stunned, but actually was able to drive home (after the rather unpleasant other driver confronted him). He had no external evidence of head trauma. He started having a bitemporal, vertex, neck, and back achy that was predominantly pulsatile, sometimes with a stabbing "needle-like" paroxysmal pain in his eyes. The headache has been constant with no temporal relationship, but of concern it actually has awakened him from sleep in the early morning hours. Getting up and walking around has not helped; neither has the [**9-8**] Ibuprofen tablets he takes, sometimes every day. The headache has been gradually worsening over time, and he finds that he is becoming quite lethargic with the headache, sleeping all day while he is usually a very active person.

The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 1426**] with chest pain in [**Month (only) 400**]. He ruled out for a myocardial infarction.  His pain was thought not to be cardiac at that time.  The patient presented again [**3263-6-23**], with complaints of chest pain times two weeks.  Chest pain occurred with exertion and occasionally at rest.  He ruled out for a myocardial infarction and did not have any ischemic electrocardiographic changes.  He had a stress test on [**3263-6-25**], stopped because of chest pain and ST depression in leads I and V6.  His rhythm was sinus.  Nuclear imaging revealed inferoapical reversible defects with an ejection fraction of 55 percent. Following stress test, the patient had a cardiac catheterization done on [**3263-7-2**], which revealed two vessel coronary artery disease.  Please see catheterization report for full details.  In summary, the patient had extremely short left main.  Left anterior descending coronary artery was diffusely diseased with 50 percent proximal stenosis and a 95 percent distal lesion.  D1 was diffusely diseased.  The circumflex had a 30 percent proximal, large obtuse marginal had 40 percent stenosis at the origin and the right coronary artery was totally occluded proximally.

He minimizes his symptoms, and reports that he has been feeling "great" and has no complaints.  Per his social worker, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1942**], she has noted a deterioration in his health over the last 2 weeks.  Her main concern has been with his balance.  He has been having trouble maintaining his balance on ambulating for several weeks.  He has had several falls recently due to difficulty with his balance and has been walking with a cane for the last 3 weeks.  He recalls his last fall to have been approximately 1 week ago.  He denies any prodromal symptoms with this fall including no lightheadedness, LOC, chest pain, SOB, and palpitations.   His social worker also notes that he has had decreased appetite with minimal PO intake for the last few days.  She notes that on her visit today, he looked pale and had difficulty breathing.

In the ED he was noted to have atrial fibrillation to 140-160s with SBP 145/65.  He was given 5 mg IV diltiazem without response and started on a diltiazem gtt.  He had an echocardiogram that was done by ED staff that revealed a pericardial effusion.  He had a formal echocardiogram that showed a moderate pericardial effusion (2cm) and no evidence of tamponade, though limited by suboptimal study due to RVR.  He is being admitted to the CCU with atrial fibrillation with difficult to control RVR on diltiazem 15 mg/hour. . On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

60 yo male with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and past tobacco use, with no prior known cardiac history complains of chest pain for thepast several months unrelated to activity. Pt had more severe symptoms on [**3086-12-20**] while at rest at home, and was noted by his wife to be ashen. BP by home monitor was 160/100. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 614**] and after being ruled out for a MI, underwent a stress test without EKG changes; however, echo was suggestive of inferior and inferolateral ischemia. EF 60%. Pt was given 2 SL NTG tablets with relief of chest pain. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where a cardiac catheterization showed left main and two vessel coronary artery disease with normal ventricular function.  He was then scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting.
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 5253**] is a 72 y/o female with a history of HCV, metastatic HCC that is not amenable to treatment, who initially presented to the ER with altered mental status since last night. Her daughters say that starting yesterday she was much more sleepy, not wanting to get up, they also said that she had been coughing and having nasal congestion. She was not eating or drinking much, only a few small sips of water. This morning she was not really waking up much, so they called 911. A BLS ambulance arrived and her fingerstick was 27, they attempted to give her oral glucose while awaiting an ACLS ambulance, after the oral glucose her repeat blood sugar was 17. After the ACLS ambulance arrived, she was given 1 amp of D50 and brought her into the [**Hospital1 18**] ER. In the ED, initial VS were: 97, 83/41, 22. She was given 2LNS, but remained hypotensive so a right IJ was placed and she was started on levophed. A bedside ultrasound was done that showed a small amount of ascites, a paracentesis was attempted twice but failed, a CXR was concerning for possible pneumonia so she was given vancomycin, ceftriaxone and flagyl. Labs were notable for a WBC of 2.1 with 25bands, lactate of 6.7, INR of 2.6, U/A with 19 white cells, Cr of 2.5 from a baseline of 1.0. VS on transfer: 124/97 on 0.03 of levo, 77, 22, 95-100% on RA. . On arrival to the MICU, her initial VS: 98.8, 118, 124/64, 20, 94% on 3LNC.

Patient is a 77F who had a primary left total hip replacement in [**2918**] by another surgeon that sustained progressive protrusio early, ultimately failing with loss of fixation of the acetabulum. I brought [**Known patient firstname 5254**] to surgery a little over a year ago at which time we felt that her best treatment option intraoperatively would be allograft packing of the acetabulum defect and a hemiarthroplasty head. Also considered at the time was a Restoration GAP prosthesis. She did well for probably 10 or 12 months and then started developing pain and x-rays demonstrated progressive protrusio with the femoral head at risk for pushing through the remnant of the acetabulum. We have also seen insufficiency fractures developing on the pubic ramus and in the posterior wall of the acetabulum. The patient is developing progressive pain, unrelenting, and sciatic symptoms. She has been made nonweightbearing a couple months ago in preparation for the surgery. She understands this is very much a salvage operation. She is developing progressive fracturing from osteoporosis and there is very little bone stock remaining. She is really not a candidate for major allograft pelvic reconstruction as fixation would be limited. Best treatment course, cemented GAP cage and avoidance of further allograft.
78F has had abd distension x 1 week.  She says she has not thrown up but her pcp's note from yesterday says she has.  She has been moving her bowels.  For the past two days she has felt weak and had diffuse abd pain.  She had a loose bms early yesterday.  She looked bad enough that family members called an ambulance today.  Initial blood pressure by EMS was 70/palp. She was not tachycardic because she is beta blocked.  She was given 4L of fluid and her blood pressure has responded well.  She threw up when she got to the ER. Currently she is not having abd pain.  Her left leg is the only source of pain. She had a similar episode following her L total hip replacement last [**Month (only) **].  A CT scan showed a pSBO.  This resolved with conservative management after 3 days.

77 male nursing home resident, 2 admissions in past month,  sent to the ED from his NH with hypoxia and worsening L sided PNA. He was found to have an O2 sat in the 70's while receiving 100% oxygen by non-rebreather face mask.  He had some ectopy for which he received 75 mg of amiodraone.  He was intubated and his oxygen saturations remained low in the 60's, with PAO2 in the 40's on vent settings of AC 500 x 15, 10 peep.  His CXR showed worsened PNA with white out of the L lung and his labs returned with + UTI and elevated lactate.  He was started on Vanc and Zosyn.  He had a PEA arrest in the ED requiring CPR and an amp of epinephrine.  A spontaneous pulse returned.  His blood pressure was opiginally in the 90's, which is his [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5280**], and then improved to the low 100's after the epinephrine.  His heart rate was in the 120's.

The patient underwent PTCA and stent placement with no residual stenosis of the SVG to D1 graft on the 8th with no complications at that time.  Notably the patient also was with a patent LIMA to LAD graft during his first catheterization.  On the [**4-11**] the patient returned to the catheterization laboratory  and underwent a percu-surge device procedure for the SVG to PDA lesion.  Notably this artery had diffuse disease proximally with 80% ulcerated stenosis and 40% mid stenosis.  The patient underwent PTCA and stent with observation of TIMI-2 fast flow.  This procedure was complicated by evidence of distal embolization of the plaque during the procedure.  Hemodynamic monitoring at this catheterization revealed RA pressure of 7, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 7, cardiac index of 2.5 with a patent SVG to D1 stent.  The patient was kept on Integrilin with a goal of 48 hours total therapy secondary to his complicated catheterization. Several hours after his second cath on [**4-11**], the patient had an acute drop in his systolic blood pressures to the 70's.  He responded with elevation of pressures after 500 cc IV fluid bolus.  Telemetry also showed three episodes of five beat nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  On the morning of the 10th the patient was complaining of pleuritic chest pain and mild shortness of breath.  CKs at this time were checked and were notably rising compared to the prior day.  EKG at this time revealed ST segment elevation of .5 to 1 mm in lead 3, AVF and precordial lead V2 to V4 ST depressions.  Later in the evening the patient continued to have constant chest pain associated only with shortness of breath.  The pain improved in the semi-upright position, however, the patient had minimal relief with increasing of an IV nitroglycerin drip or morphine.  After consultation of the interventional cardiology fellow it was believed that the patient was likely having a subacute myocardial infarction as indicated by ischemic changes on EKG and persistent chest discomfort post cath in the setting of a complicated catheterization with evidence of distal embolization.  It was the impression of the staff interventional cardiologist that the patient was not suitable to take back to the catheterization laboratory, since there was no suitable therapy for small vessel distal embolization.  The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit at this time for hemodynamic monitoring and for close observation.
63 year-old M with CAD s/p CABG ([**2845**] - LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM2, SVG to D1, SVG to PDA), s/p PTCA ([**2853**] - stents placed to SVG to D1 graft and SVG to PDA graft) who presented with chest pain to OSH, transferred here for cardiac cath, now s/p cath.  He awoke from sleep at home with 8/10 chest pain, L arm discomfort, and diaphoresis.  No SOB or nausea.  He arose and felt lightheaded and proceeded to have a syncopal event.  No trauma.

Neurological exam shows awake, alert and oriented times three with fluent speech, normal language and comprehension. Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact and visual fields were full to confrontation.  The face was symmetric and sensation was intact to light touch.  The tongue and uvula were midline and the remainder of the cranial nerve exam was unremarkable. Reflexes were 2+ bilaterally in the upper extremities, 0 at the knees and ankles and the toes were downgoing.  Sensation was intact to light touch throughout the extremities.  The finger to nose and finger showed slight tremor on the left but no true dysmetria.  Gait was steady and normal based and negative Romberg and there was normal tandem gait.  The vital signs at the time of admission showed a blood pressure of 170/103.  Heart rate 86.  Respiratory rate 16 with 02 saturation at 98% and a temperature was afebrile. Due to the findings in the Emergency Room, the patient underwent an MRI/MRA which showed abnormal flow void in the right temporal lobe and question of a right mid cerebral artery aneurysm.  There is no evidence of hemorrhage however, and the MRA confirmed a 4 mm right mid cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm. HOSPITAL COURSE:  Laboratory studies at the time of admission were within normal limits, and due to the clinical findings, the patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management and was taken to the Angiogram Suite on the morning following admission where a diagnostic angiogram was performed and the patient was found to have a right middle cerebral artery aneurysm.  Due to those findings, the patient was taken to the Operating Room on the [**3499-2-28**] where under general endotracheal anesthetic, the patient underwent a right craniotomy with a clipping of the right middle cerebral artery aneurysm performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1117**] and the patient tolerated the procedure well. Her postoperative course was essentially unremarkable.  She did receive two units of fresh frozen plasm within the first 24 hours postoperatively for a initial INR of 1.5.

She was first found this morning at 1030hrs on [**2764-8-7**] on the floor, by her husband. It was unknown how long she was down for. At that time, she was able to communicate and said she couldn't hear or see well. She did say that she tripped and fell and that was why she was on the floor. She was also confused when she was found; she was asking how to get to the bathroom. EMS came to her house; by that time, she was walking, talking and reportedly oriented, so she remained at home. During the afternoon, there is a question if she had a visual field cut. She was napping on and off all afternoon, but was reportedly talking to her husband at times and it was thought she may have not been completely acting like herself. She was also thought to still be confused; an example given was that she may have had trouble telling time. Her granddaughter went to check on her at 1700hrs and at that time, she was again found on the floor, moaning, not speaking and nor moving her left arm (unclear if moving left leg). Her husband had reportedly went to the bathroom just prior to this and when he left, she was not on the floor, though no one know with certainity if she was moving her left arm and when the last time was that she actually spoke. EMS was called again and brought the patient to [**Hospital1 18**]. EMS notes upon finding the patient, the left arm was plegic, but she began moving it en route. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], a CODE STROKE was called. Neuro ROS: unable to obtain from patient.
Patient is a 42 year-old male with past medical history significant for alcoholism and depression.

He had a scalp laceration which was not initially able to be repaired due to c-spine precautions. The patient had a head CT which was negative for any intracranial bleeds. CT neck also negative for any fractures. In the ED, initial vs were: T P 88, BP 89/58, RR 14 and O2 sat 100% RA.  While in the ED the patient appeared anxious and confused initially. ETOH level was 105 and the rest of toxicology screen was negative. . In the ED he then had a witnessed apneic episode and then went unresponsive for a few seconds per ED resdient but he had a palpable pulse and blood pressures remained stable. During this episode he had dropping oxygen saturations (drop not recorded) and he was clinching his jaw to the point where he chipped his tooth. Patient then went into rapid bilateral upper extremity myoclonic jerking followed by partial proning of his arms bilaterally. He was given Ativan 2mg IV x2, then 5mg IV Ativan, then 6mg IV Ativan, followed by 7mg IV Ativan in ED. . Minutes later he developed SVT to 200 range which appeared to be atrial fibrillation vs. flutter per ED resident. He was intubated rapidly and then cardioverted in the ED with good response as HR returned to NSR with rate in 70-90 range. . EKG was significant for borderline long QRS at .122 as well. Toxicology was called and suggested patient be given bicarbonate fluid to cover for possible TCA overdose given EKG findings. While in ED he was given tetanus shot given new scalp laceration, 3L NS IVFs and then 3Amps bicarbonate were given in D5. He also got 1g IV Dilantin load and he was placed on Propofol and a Versed drip started after intubation. . On arrival to the MICU patient was intubated and sedated. He was on AC mode with Tv 600 x RR 16, FiO2 40% and PEEP 5. HR was 90, BP 132/88 and patient was afebrile. He had dry dressings packed over right sided head laceration and he was in a c-spine collar.

He has had one hospital admission ([**10-15**]) for bradycardia in the past in the setting of severe hyperkalemia (K=8.9).  At that time he was treated with atropine and ended up with a wide-complex tachycardia requiring intubation and pressors. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
75 y/o M [**First Name3 (LF) **] speaking only PMH ESRD on HD, CAD, PAF, COPD, HTN who presensts with altered mental status of 2 days duration. Initially felt to be secondary to percocet use at rehab, but HD facility was concerned and sent patient to be evaluated. Per family patient is AOx3 at baseline but has been more confused recently. Notes slow decline over several days since being at the rehab. States he was also given a "sleeping pill" the day before admission. Family did not notice any increased cough, SOB, or fever. . Patient was recently admitted [**Date range (3) 5454**] for left humeral fracture, hypoxia and inability to care for himself at home. For left humeral fracture patient was evaluated by ortho who recommended sling. Hypoxia was felt to be secondary to mild COPD exacerbation and was treated with aggressive neb therapy and oral steroids. At time of discharge his O2 sats were 90% on RA with occasional desats to the high 80s and discharged on 1L NC to be weaned as tolerated. Patient was discharged to rehab. .

75 year old male with history of diabetes and hyperlipidemia referred by PCP for exercise stress test for symptoms of chest discomfort with exertion. He reports that he is quite active but recently has noticed that his walking is limited by left sided chest pressure that resolves with rest. ETT demonstrated 2-4 mm horizontal ST segment depressions inferiorly and in leads V4-V6. In addition, ST segment elevation was noted in lead aVR. He was also symptomatically hypotensive with lightheadedness. He now underwent cardiac catheterization that revealed significant coronary artery disease.
This is a 67 year-old man with a past medical history significant for noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as prostate cancer status post radical prostatectomy who had previously had a penile implant under the care of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5502**].  The patient initially had cardiac catheterization in [**3228**] following a stress test prior to his surgery for prostate cancer.  At that time he underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his right coronary artery, which was complicated by a VF arrest, which was managed by defibrillation and CPR on [**3228-11-23**]. He then began having exertional anginal symptoms last year, however, no angina at rest.  He also began complaining of acid reflux symptoms beginning in [**3237-9-20**], which was treated by Prilosec.  He underwent a stress test [**3237-12-21**] and subsequently another cardiac catheterization in [**3237-12-20**], which revealed 80% left anterior descending coronary artery disease, 70% left circumflex disease and 80% right coronary artery disease with an EF of 45%. MEDICATIONS PREOPERATIVELY:  Procardia, Lipitor, Atenolol, Imdur, Glucophage, Zestril and aspirin. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent coronary artery bypass graft times four on [**3238-2-1**] with the left internal mammary to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal, saphenous vein graft to the diagonal and saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending coronary artery.  Total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 94 minutes total cross clamp time was 50 minutes. The patient was transferred in stable condition to the Coronary Care Unit being A paced at 80 beats per minute in stable condition on neo-synephrine at .5 mcg per kilogram per minute and Propofol at 30 mcg per kilogram per minute.  The patient was extubated very early postoperative day one without complications.  Postoperative day one the patient awake, alert and oriented times three, moving all of his extremities and following commands, in sinus rhythm at 79. Vital signs are stable with adequate urine output.  The patient's blood sugars were high so an insulin drip was started per protocol.  Still on the neo drip at .25. Afebrile with a white blood cell count of 9.8 and hematocrit of 32.6, BUN 16, creatinine .9.  The plan for the day was to wean the patient's neo-synephrine to off.  Postoperative day two no events over the past 24 hours aside from the neo-synephrine being weaned off.  The patient still in sinus rhythm at 73, vital signs are stable.  Afebrile with a white count of 9.3 and a hematocrit of 28.4.  A BUN of 15, creatinine of .8.  The plan was to begin the patient's Lopressor and Lasix. On physical examination the patient with scattered rhonchi at the lower bases, which clears with coughing.  The patient still is being covered for heparin subQ for fluctuating blood sugars.  The patient was transferred to the floor later postoperative day two in stable condition with complaints of mild pain at incision sites, which was relieved with Percocet.  Urology came by to see the patient, because there was a difficult Foley placement the day of surgery.  Urology then removed the Foley catheter the day of consult, which was [**2-3**], postoperative day two.  The patient had no complaints with voiding and a condom catheter was in place. Urology explained to the patient that he may leak more then usual after the dilatation and he was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after discharge from the hospital. Postoperative day three the patient awake, alert and oriented with complaints of mild incisional pain relieved with Percocet.  The patient's Foley was discontinued and the patient now complains of incontinence since his Foley removal. Postoperative day four the patient was doing well with no difficulty urinating.  The patient was discharged home on [**3238-2-5**] with discharge instructions including follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in four to six weeks as well as follow up with his cardiologist in two to four weeks.

The patient is a 61 year old female with a history of small cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2907**], status post chemotherapy, radiation therapy including prophylactic whole brain irradiation and stem cell rescue, also with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen and recurrent right sided pleural effusion who presented to the clinic on the day of admission with increasing shortness of breath.  The patient was sent to the emergency department from the clinic where she was found to be saturating in the 90s on 100 percent nonrebreathing.  A right sided thoracentesis was done with removal of 600 cc of serous fluid which initially improved the patient's oxygen saturation.  However, the patient subsequently desaturated again on the nonrebreather requiring intubation.  The patient's daughter reported that she has had increased agitation and somnolence as well as green/[**Doctor Last Name 347**] sputum over the past seven days.  She had been started on levofloxacin without significant improvement in the sputum production.  On the day prior to admission she developed increased somnolence and lethargy prompting her visit to clinic.  She received ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
49M transfer from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 614**] s/p bicycle accident (head-on collision with another bicyclist). He was helmeted and there was a possible LOC, brought to [**Location (un) 614**] where patient was initially A + O x 3, workup there included CT head showing ICH, right orbital fracture, overlying laceration concern raising for open fracture. At OSH, the pt became somnolent and less responsive after receiving pain meds (dilaudid 1mg IV), and was intubated electively for airway protection. He received Td and Ancef 1g IV at OSH. Reportedly only able to visualize counting fingers w. R eye at OSH prior to intubation During transport had difficulty sedating with propofol, titrated up to maximal dosing, switched to versed and fentanyl on arrival for better sedation.

This is a 58-year-old man with metastatic renal cell cancer to the thyroid, left clavicle, left femur, upper thoracic spine, lower thoracic spine, mid lumbar spine, and L5 spinous process, also soft tissue mass at the T2-T3 spinous process and pedicles, as well as subpleural nodular densities.  The patient went to MRI to followup on CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis done on [**3174-1-7**] for restaging of disease.  This reveals soft tissue masses involving upper thoracic spine, L3 vertebral body which prompted a MRI.  Findings prompted decision to have patient come to the Emergency Department for evaluation. Symptoms include right scapular pain and right shoulder pain and weakness from prior.  The patient also has occasional left lateral thigh cramp, but no lower extremity weakness or bladder or bowel incontinence.
Patient is a 59-year-old gentleman diagnosed with metastatic renal cell cancer in [**3173-4-21**].  He underwent a debulking left nephrectomy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3173-6-11**], and was diagnosed with metastatic kidney cancer by thyroidectomy in [**3173-4-21**].  This revealed high grade renal cell carcinoma that was metastatic to the adrenal gland.  Following debulking nephrectomy, he was found to be presented with severe bone pain.  Location of his pain was in the right shoulder.  Given that the pain did not resolve, he underwent a MRI which showed ultimately a lytic lesion in the right shoulder and was treated with radiation therapy to the shoulder as well as ultimately undergoing treatment with chemotherapy.  He did not respond to chemotherapy and developed a large lytic lesion in the left femur requiring an operative embolization and rod placement in 02/[**3173**].  Following that, he had multiple radiation therapies to the spine as well as right scapula as well as left femur. He was seen on multiple occasions over the last several weeks complaining of increasing pain in the right shoulder.  CT scan revealed a large lytic lesion.  Given that this area had been radiated twice, tentatively booked to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in Radiology for radiofrequency ablation for pain relief.  He has been on OxyContin 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. and Morphine elixir for breakthrough pain, and he has been a little better over the last few days.  He has not moved his bowels in three days, and also had difficulty urinating.  This initially felt to be related to the increase in narcotic, but now he describes difficulty feeling a full bladder, and had been voiding very little over the last day.  He was admitted to the Oncology service for workup of this urinary retention. He is also complaining of leg weakness. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was a gentleman in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  EOMs full.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen is soft, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Neurologically, cranial nerves II through XII intact.  His motor strength is [**2-23**] in the right upper extremity, [**3-25**] in the left upper extremity, and [**3-25**] on bilateral lower extremities.  His reflexes in the upper extremities and lower extremities is symmetric, and sensation to cold and pin prick and light touch bilaterally, gait are normal.  There is no saddle anesthesia. He was admitted now with urinary retention and bowel retention likely due to increased pain medication, but will rule out cord compression.  He had a MRI of his cervical spine, which showed evidence of tumor at the T1-T3 level with moderate-to-severe cord compression.  Also disease at the T1 level causing some deformity of the spinal cord.  Therefore Neurosurgery was consulted. The patient was taken to the Neurosurgery service and brought to the operating room for decompression laminectomy of the thoracic and cervical spine.  First on [**3174-7-21**], underwent a thoracic embolization of the tumor, and then was taken to the operating room on [**3174-7-22**], and underwent T2-T3 resection of metastatic lesions, spinal cord decompression with segmental C7-T4 stabilization. Postoperative, his vital signs were stable.  He was afebrile. His motor strength was [**3-25**] in all muscle groups.  He had no pronator drift.  His laboratories were within normal limits. He was neurologically stable and transferred to the regular floor.  He has had two drains in place, which stayed in until postoperative day #5.  He had minimal output of both drains on day five, and they were pulled.  Continued on IV antibiotic treatment while drains were in place.  His incisions were clean, dry, and intact.  He was seen by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy, and was thought to possibly acquire rehab, although made significant improvement over his hospital stay, and opted for discharge to home with followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1117**] in two weeks for staple removal. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Diazepam 5 mg p.o. q.6h. 2. Gentamicin ophthalmic solution one drop OU q.4h. 3. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d. 4. Lactulose 30 cc p.o. q.4h. prn. 5. OxyContin 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. 6.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname 1109**] is 62 year old female with a history of small cell lung diagnosed in [**2907**] status post chemo and x ray therapy, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recurrent right pleural effusion, pseudomonal pneumonia and respiratory failure with tracheostomy in [**5-28**]. The patient was recently discharged from a rehabilitation facility to home where she was doing well using ventilation only at night when she experienced the sudden onset of dyspnea on the day of admission. She was suctioned but only had a transient improvement. EMS was called and the patient was transfered to an outside hospital where she was unresponsive. After receiving two nebulizer treatments and a dose of unasyn she improved. There, she was changed to assist control ventilation 400/12/40%/PEEP 5, following which she became alert and responsive. She was then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. A chest x ray from the outside hospital showed right pleural effusion and/ or right lower lobe collapse.
The patient is a 55-year-old male with PMH of alcoholism who presents after a dangerous combination of alcohol intoxication and accidental medication overdose. Per report, patient's partner says he "fell off the wagon" 2-3 days ago after being sober for years. He drank large quantities of port wine and took extra medications reportedly "by mistake." The partner is pretty sure that the patient was intoxicated when he multiple tablets of wellbutrin, seroquel, propranolol and klonipin but he is uncertain of specific amount. He later stated that he was not absolutely certain whether the patient actually ingested any wellbutrin and propanolol. Ultimately, the amount and combination of pills taken was unclear. The patient's longtime partner of nearly thirty years came home and found him semi-alert and called EMS immediately. . According to his partner, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6339**] had been coughing/wheezing for several months now but had no complaints of fevers or chills.  He had been complaining about pain in his neck since a fall down a few stairs a few days prior to this current incident. . In our ED, initial vital signs were T97.3 BP 90/54 HR 68 RR 12 oxygen saturation of 95% via NRB. He was placed on NRB for low oxygen saturations <90. He was somnolent on arrival to hospital but still responsive to tactile stimuli.  Fingerstick glucose was 140 on arrival. He quickly became hypotensive to SBP 73/47. He was given IVF x3L total. EKG was normal, without any alarming ST changes. Peripheral dopamine was started for rapid BP correction and he was intubated for hypoxia and airway protection. Toxicology consult was called and they recommended that the pressor choice be switched to Levofed. He was also given narcan x2 with no effect. Once the medication history was flushed out, he was given calcium which did increase his rate from 58 to 88 and his SBP increased by 10. He was given glucagon 1mg with no further effect. Toxicology consult recommended trying high dose glucagon 5mg and if that works, starting a glucagon gtt at 1-5mg/hr. They also recommend serial EKGs for monitoring.  He was also given Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone due to initial concern for possible sepsis. . He had chest xray which showed question widened mediastinum and patient reported some chest discomfort on arrival. CTA was done which showed normal aorta. FAST scan was done which showed no pericardial effusion, and no intra-abdominal bleeds.  CXR/CT did show bilateral infiltrates consistent with an aspiration. Hemodynamic instability was worrisome and he was transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring. . On arrival to the ICU he was hypoxic with O2 saturation of 85% on FIO2 of 50%, HR in 50's.  He was suctioned, ET tube pulled back 2cm and PEEP increased to 14, FIO2 to 100% with slow recovery of O2 saturation. He was continued on Levophed and an arterial line was placed for better hemodynamic monitoring. .

This is a 60-year-old gentlemen who was in previously good health until [**9-18**] when he felt weak and fell to the ground and also had one episode of hematemesis.  In retrospect, the patient recalls that one week prior to admission he had an episode of melena.  Patient was evaluated at [**Hospital3 3711**] and was found to have a hematocrit of 25.5.  An nasogastric tube lavage at that time revealed maroon fluid coffee grounds.  The patient on that day underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed 2+ varices and erosions in the cardiac antrum.  The patient was transfused four units of packed red blood cells to stabilize his hematocrit at 29-30%. The patient underwent a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**9-20**] which again showed 2+ varices and gastritis with no evidence of active bleeding. At that point, the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital6 1739**] where his hematocrit was found to be 28.2.  The patient was admitted directly to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  The patient underwent a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**9-21**] which showed Grade III varices in the lower one third of the esophagus and also stigmata of recent bleeding.  Four bands were placed around these varices.  In addition, the esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed some evidence of gastritis and portal hypertensive gastropathy with nonbleeding varices in the cardia. In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, his creatinine dropped further to 26 and the patient was given an additional one unit of packed blood cells to increase his hematocrit to 29.8.  At the time of transfer out of Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient no longer had reported any more episodes of hematemesis.  He denied any abdominal pain but still noted tarry stools.

Briefly, pt is a 78 year old male admitted from a [**Hospital1 1483**] with persistent leukocytosis and a febrile epsiode. Pthad WBC of 30 on [**12-15**] and was started on levaquin for presumed urinary tract infection, although his urine culture was polymicrobial in nature. His WBC had trended down to 8, but yesterday he had a fever to 100.7 and his WBC increased to 12.1.  Pt is largely non-verbal and was unable to participate in the interview. Of particular note, pt was previously admitted in [**Month (only) 354**]/[**2854-10-13**] after he sustained a fall complicated by C1/C2 fractures and bilateral intraparenchymal hemorrhages, now s/p G-tube placement. This hospitalization was also complicated by bradycardia to the 30s, with baseline HRs in the 50s in atrial fibrillation. Donepezil was held due to AV nodal effects and TTE was unremarkable with a normal EF >55%. Cardiology was consulted and considered pacemaker placement at the time. In the ED, initial VS: 98.8 72 110/74 20 96% 2L. He was given acetaminophen and IVFs. Repeat labs showed a leukocytosis to 13.8 without a bandemia and a mild transaminitis. RUQ U/S showed 2cm non-obstructing gallstone without gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid (CBD not visualized). CXR was without consolidation concerning for PNA. U/A showed significant blood, but only 14 WBCs and small leuk esterase with no bacteria (on levofloxacin). Vitals on transfer were: Temp: 98.7, Pulse: 80, RR: 18, BP: 118/84, O2Sat: 97, O2Flow: RA. On the floor, he is non-verbal and is difficult to assess any pain or discomfort. The patient developed increasing secretions on the floor complicated by cardiopulmonary arrest. He was intubated and resuscitated with return of spontaneous circulation after two rounds of chest compressions. He was transfered to the ICU, then made CMO and transfered to the floor after extubation.
61 year old male with history of Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, and known 3 vessel CAD who presents with chest pain. Patient states that on [**2-1**] he was in [**Country 6426**] visiting his brother when he developed SSCP associated with diaphoresis. Went to the hospital and was found to have an NSTEMI. Cardiac catheterization revealed three vessel CAD with mild LV systolic dysfunction (LAD 70% ostial stenosis, RCA Mid 90% stenosis, OM 70% proximal lesion). Given that the patient had thrombocytopenia secondary to MDS versus CLL he was not taken for CABG. Instead he was medically opitmized and returned to [**Location 86**] for follow up with his cardiologist. . After his return the patient saw his cardiologist who performed and nuclear stress test which showed inducible ischemia with minmal activity in LAD/RCA distribution. Throughout this time the patient notes intermittent chest pain. He notes that it is very difficult to differentiate between chest pain secondary to GERD versus a cardiac origin. He typically notes worsened chest pain after eating. Further should he eat and attempt to walk he will get worsened chest pain and shortness of breath which will reguire him to stop and rest. Since returning from [**Country 6426**] patient has used a nitro patch daily with 2-3 SL nitros daily. In the last two days patient has used more SL nitroglycerin and has been using nitropatch at night.

Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 7625**] is status post non-Q wave MI in [**2605**].  At that time, she had an angioplasty to the RCA.  Post intervention she had an episode of PSVT. Since then she has done well until the last few months when she started to experience recurrent symptoms.  She reports chest tightness and dyspnea with exertion such as going up a flight of stairs. Also she has been complaining of periods of lightheadedness and feeling very fatigue.  She reports her symptoms having become progressively worse over the past few months and having felt palpitations on a daily basis lasting less than a minute at a time.  She had an episode of discomfort two nights prior to admission that lasting 20 minutes then resolved on its own.  She presented to the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency room which she reported had two sets of negative CPKs and two EKGs that were negative for any acute changes. A stress test done on [**9-15**] during which the patient achieved 73% of her predicted age heart rate and did not have any chest pain throughout the procedure.  T segments were uninterpretable because the patient had PSVT beginning one minute after exercise which resolved spontaneously two minutes following the end of the stress test. Nuclear imaging revealed mild completely reversible inferior wall defect.
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 7625**] is a 71 year old woman admitted for weakness for 1 day after recently being discharged from the hospital.  She had previously been admitted for shortness of breath and underwent cardiac catherization which revealed aortic insufficiency and was worked up for valve replacement surgery.
This is a 70-year-old male with a history of mechanical aortic valve replacement in [**2672-4-9**] (#25 CarboMedics valve) with an INR goal on warfarin of 2.5-3.5, Parkinson's disease with dementia who was admitted for altered mental status and failure to thrive at home on [**2683-10-1**] and was noted to have a right subcapital femoral neck fracture.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7643**], earlier in the week, namely Monday had a composite resection by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1814**] and team. This was for a ulcerating, longstanding lesion involving the left temporal region and upper cheek. The lesion was moved in continuity with the superficial gland of the parotid. Some upper branches of the ophthalmic division and the entire frontal division of the left facial nerve were resected and appropriately tagged by us.  At that time, a VAC dressing was applied. When the pathology report came back yesterday afternoon for clear margins at all sites of the resection, he was brought to the operating room today for appropriate full-thickness flap coverage of the left upper cheek and temporal regions.
72 y/o female with known mitral regurgitation who was referred for surgical intervention.
50 yo female s/p fall down stairs w/ +EtOH, +LOC, combative and intubated upon arrival in the ED.
63F with a hx of ETOH abuse who fell this evening, no LOC and was brought to [**Hospital **] Hospital where a Head CT revealed a R SDH vs. EDH. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
65F s/p mechanical fall down stairs while intoxicated with brief LOC. She was first seen at [**Hospital **] Hospital, then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. She has a history of alcohol-related falls and traumatic SAH and SDH in [**3348**] and [**3351**]. Evaluation at the outside hospital and [**Hospital1 18**] revealed a parafalcine SDH and nasal bone fractures. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management. She was initially admitted to the trauma surgical service where she was found to have L1 compression fracture and bilateral maxillary sinus fractures and a nasal fracture. CT head showed parafalcine subdural hematoma. She was seen by neurosurgery who recommended serial CT scans which showed stable size of SDH with blood products seen within the right ventricle [**3354-5-20**] (neurosurg thought this was breakdown blood products and nothing to address at this point). During admission she became increasingly agitated with altered mental status. She fell out of bed and had CT C-T-L spine and CT head which did not show significant change from original films. She was treated initially with zyprexa, then transitioned to ativan with CIWA due to concern for alcohol withdrawl. Agitation continued prompting initiation of precedex on [**3354-5-19**]. She was transferred from the SICU service to the MICU service on [**3354-5-20**] for management of delerium.  In the MICU, haldol was initiated and patient improved. A urinalysis was also obtained and was concerning for UTI. Therapy with ceftriaxone was initiated on [**5-20**]. She is being transferred to medicine for further management. . The patient has minimal recollection of the events that led to her hospitalization.  The patient's husband reports that he found the patient on the floor at the bottom of a flight of stairs and gathered that she fell because she was intoxicated.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7658**] is a 40 year old laborer with AIDS and a CD4 count of 12, as well as genotype 1b Hepatitis C, with recent occupational exposure to sewage and recent crack cocaine and marijuana use, who presents with 3 weeks of progressive dyspnea. . About 1.5 months ago, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7658**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] unemployed [**Hospital1 **]-afilliated laborer, took a brief job helping clean sections of sewage-coated areas of the Deer Island Sewage Treatment Plant, in which he used a large vacuum cleaner to clean sewage, ripe with the smell of feces, out of trough-like areas of the plant. He found this to be very physically demanding work, one of the hardest jobs he's ever had in a work history marked mainly by laborer and demolition work in construction, but he did not lose his energy and additionally, he had [**Last Name **] problem bicycling to work. When the job ended, about 3-4 weeks ago apparently (although his timeline is not entirely consistent), he had a large amount of cash on hand and used it to binge on crack cocaine and Klonopins, the former being a frequent past drug of choice for him, and the latter being a more unusual variation. This run of drug use lasted about a week. . Apparently around the time this week ended he got what he describes as "a cold" with some runny nose and cough; he says that everyone in his rooming house got a cold, but he was the only one not to get over it. 2 weeks ago he quit smoking. His respiratory status gradually worsened, with more and more difficulty breathing. Over the last week he has had little appetite, even despite some efforts to smoke marijuana to stimulate it; and he believes that he has lost weight. He has had subjective fever symptoms of feeling cold and getting sweats for several weeks. . He reports that earlier today he tried to take a shower, shave, and brush his teeth; this required frequent stops to get his breath and all told took about an hour and a half. .

He was seen in the emergency department on [**9-16**], at which time he had not started his z-pack, where he complained of productive cough with yellow-green sputum, but without shortness of breath or chest pain. He started his azithromycin then, after the ED visit, and had continued to take it up until his admission on [**9-20**]. He returned with still worse cough, shortness of breath, and dyspnea with exertion. . In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.3; P 122 BP 114/80 R 30 O2 sat 88%RA. Patient was given: Levofloxacin 750 mg IVx1 Vancomycin 1gm IV x1 Primaquine 30 mg PO x1 Clindamycin 600 mg IV x1 . When arriving in the [**Hospital Unit Name 152**], Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7658**] was conversing easily while wearing a face mask. He complained of cold temperature in cool-to-normal room. He had his [**Known patient lastname 2731**] medicines with him and planned to take them while he was here and emphasized that he was now taking them faithfully. He did discuss some instances in which he was found to have HIV in prior group houses and this created problems for him, and he does not let his fellow rooming house residents know that he has HIV; he denies that this is now a barrier to adherence. .

The patient is a 76M w/ a h/o CAD s/p CABG approximately 19 years ago, atrial flutter since [**3005**] on Coumadin and Atenolol, who presented for elective aflutter ablation +/- pacemaker after increased DOE. He had increased SOB after walking up two flights of stairs and noted his heart rate (resting in the 70s) had been rising to 150s with minimal amounts of exercise. . After the ablation, he was noted to be in sinus node arrest, necessitating the need for a pacemaker. During pacemaker insertion, he became hypotensive to SBP 60s-70s. Dopamine was started and his SBP returned to 90s-100s. TTE was negative for pericardial effusion. CT abdomen was preliminarily negative for RP bleed. The patient denies lightheadedness, presyncope/syncope, palpitations, chest pain, or shortness of breath during the procedure. He was transferred to the CCU on low-dose dopamine (2.5cc/hr) in comfortable and stable condition for further monitoring. .

The patient denied any hematemesis, melena or bright red blood per rectum at that time.  She reported that her last bowel movement had been two days prior to admission and normal.  She also complained of progressive weakness and has a history of peptic ulcer disease and gastritis, diagnosed in [**3035-8-5**] on esophagogastroduodenoscopy done at that time. Before arriving at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3811**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], the patient had presented to an outside hospital, where nasogastric lavage done at that time revealed 700 cc of coffee-grounds and no further emesis.  Her hematocrit on presentation was 36.  She was admitted to the hospital with serial hematocrits, hydration and was scheduled to undergo an esophagogastroduodenoscopy the following day.  However, prior to the esophagogastroduodenoscopy, she developed diffuse crampy abdominal pain. A nasogastric tube was placed at that time for 200 cc of bilious material.  A KUB done showed dilated loops of small bowel with air fluid levels.  There was no free air on upright chest x-ray.  An abdominal CT scan done showed free fluid in the pelvis with no free air, dilated loops of small bowel with a transition point in the left pelvis and distally collapsed small bowel.

This is a 57 year old male with hypercholesterolemia and known coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**3362**] with quiescent disease since then, not requiring sublingual Nitroglycerin; chest pain either.  He presented with one day of chest pain that began this morning while putting up wallpaper.  The patient noted ten out of ten chest pain, substernal chest pain with no radiation with associated diaphoresis but no shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea or vomiting. The patient took three sublingual Nitroglycerin that had already expired without effect, called Emergency Medical Services where he received Nitroglycerin spray times two without effect as well. At the outside hospital, he was noted to have ST elevations in leads II, III and F plus reciprocal ST depressions in leads V1 through V2.  The patient received ReoPro and Retavase at full dose as well as Nitroglycerin and aspirin at the outside hospital.  There was no change in his chest pain, therefore, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 341**]. In the Catheterization Laboratory here, he was noted to have a pulmonary arterial pressure of 38/21 with a pulmonary arterial mean of 26.  A PCWP of 19.  All grafts were found to be open.  The right coronary artery was noted to have a 30% proximal stenosis and a mid-99% stenosis which was stented. After catheterization, the patient was made chest pain free. Note:  The patient may have become transiently hypotensive at the outside hospital after Nitroglycerin.
cc: Seizures versus syncope transferred from [**Hospital1 **] at around 3 am, [**Hospital1 111**] was at maximal capacity therefore could not accept the transfer. 72 yo man with an extensive past medical history, and of note: End Stage Renal Disease(started on hemodialysis one month ago), dialysis days Tue/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat Normal pressure hydrocephalus & Parkinsonism (s/p VP [**Hospital1 5757**] Hakim programmable shunt placed at the [**Hospital1 749**] in Han [**2594**], on [**7-4**] setting changed from 9-->11 cm of water). He has had no previous seizures and he presented with 2 episodes that were thought to be seizures (note in [**2579**] at [**Hospital1 18**] prior to his L CEA he had 2XEEGs), intubated at OSH. Wife reports that his mental status has waxed and waned for the past years, however, she noticed that he has been more confused for the past 1 week than usual. For over a week he has felt light headed. He was feeling dizzy all day long yesterday. She reports a mild fall backwards on the toilet without hitting his head or any loss of consciouness. Of note, he had been having more frequent headaches recently and he had his shunt re-adjusted 5 days ago. At 6:30pm his wife found him on the floor, unresponsive, with blood coming out of his mouth as he had bit his tongue. She called 911 and he was taken to [**Hospital **] Hospital. He had an event where he arched his head, eyes rolled back and there was extensor posturing of his arms and legs, and this lasted minutes. He received morphine 2 mg, dilaudid 0.5 mg, ativan 2 mg, Etomidate 20, Succ 150 and he was intubated for airway protection and so it is unclear which [**Doctor Last Name 355**] aborted the event. He was then transferred here. Neurosurgery were consulted on the patient, and as per Neurosurgery mentioned that if the shunt required tapping they would do it, but left no recs. He received ceftriaxone 2g, vancomycin 1g and acyclovir 700mg empirically in ER. He also received 500mg dilantin in ER. On contacting Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], he mentioned that he had seen the patient last Friday and was concerned about syncopal events for over a week. Post HD his SBP had been dropping and he was on a number on anti-HTN agents. During his in patient stay at [**Hospital1 18**], it became clear that these episodes were syncopal related to his severe orthostatic hypotension.
Patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of HIV, not on HAART, no history of opportunistic infection, who presented with weeks of worsening dyspnea.  The patient refused to see his primary doctor, but the patient's ex-noted that he was becoming increasingly dyspneic over the month prior to admission.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5774**] was working in his cellar on [**3494-10-27**] when he tripped and fell on a step and sustained a left subcapital hip fracture.  As you know, this was treated with an uncemented Osteonics Omnifit hemiarthroplasty on [**3494-10-28**].  This was performed through an anterolateral approach.  His postoperative course was uneventful. Over the ensuing months, he did receive treatment from an orthopedic surgeon in [**State 107**], whereby he was given viscosupplementation injections of the left knee.  He did not have any improvement of his knee pain at that time. Subsequently, in [**3495-4-8**], he was admitted with pneumonia.  At that time, his hip was painful and an x-ray revealed subluxation of the hemiarthroplasty.  Aspiration was positive for infection. The aspiration white cell count on [**3495-5-7**] was 35,500 with 97% polys.  The patient was then taken to the operating room by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who performed a resection of the hemiarthroplasty, irrigation and debridement, and spacer with antibiotic cement.  Tissue culture on [**3495-5-8**] revealed coagulase negative Staphylococcus as well as propionibacterium acnes.  The patient was then subsequently treated with intravenous antibiotics and the spectrum was widened to include vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin.  He was discharged on an antibiotic regimen of vancomycin and ceftriaxone and demonstrated improvement in his fevers and pain.  He completed five weeks of intravenous vancomycin.  He developed Clostridium difficile infection on [**3495-6-11**] which was treated with Flagyl. For this reason, IV antibiotics were discontinued at five weeks rather than six weeks.  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5774**] now presents for assessment for reimplantation of the hip.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5775**] is a 71-year-old male with an extensive cardiac history.  His last cardiac catheterization was [**8-25**] during which he had a stent to his D1 and presented with unstable angina.  Patient describes stable angina as substernal chest pain with walking "one city block".  He states his chest pain was relieved with rest. Today the patient describes sudden onset of substernal chest pain at rest while having a bowel movement around 2 pm. Per patient report and wife, had an ETT at Dr.[**Name (NI) 5691**] office on Friday that was within normal limits.  Today, his chest pain was [**9-2**] consistent with previous angina associated with nausea, dry heaves, positive shortness of breath, and perfuse diaphoresis.  The patient called EMS, his wife was not home. His blood pressure at the time was 168/92 with a pulse of 90. Patient had missed his am medications.  The patient was given aspirin, sublingual nitroglycerin, albuterol, and his chest pain decreased to [**4-2**].  At the outside hospital Emergency Department, the patient was started on Plavix, Integrilin, and Heparin, intravenous nitroglycerin, morphine sulfate, and Lopressor. His electrocardiogram showed anterior ST elevations, and he was taken to the catheterization laboratory.  At the catheterization laboratory, he was shown to have a complex bifurcation stenosis at the left anterior descending artery/D1.  Balloon angioplasty was performed to the D1 and left anterior descending artery with residual 30% stenosis in each.  Patient was chest pain free status post procedure.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management. At [**Hospital1 69**], the patient was asymptomatic with no chest pain, no shortness of breath, and his vital signs were stable.
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 34 yo female with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, obesity, anxiety, multifocal atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, left atrial tachycardia, and AVNRT.  She was admitted after pulmonary vein isolation complicated by atrial tachycardia requiring cardioversion and SOB from pulm edema requiring post-procedure re-intubation. The patient was admitted for elective pulmonary vein isolation. Both groin veins were accessed for the procedure. At the end of the procedure, she developed atrial tachycardia with 2:1 block at a rate of approximately 100. This atrial tach was not ablated though she was cardioverted back to NSR. She was successfully extubated after cardioversion. She had received an estimated 4.5L of fluid during the procedure. She developed shortness of breath after extubation. Exam and CXR were concerning for pulmonary edema. She responded well to 40mg IV lasix x2 with an estimated 3L urine output. Nonetheless, the patient's shortness of breath worsened, saturating 92% on NRB and speaking in short sentences. She required re-intubation and received propofol and vecuronium during intubation. She has been hospitalized several times over the past 1-2 months with symptoms of palpitations and dyspnea associated with atrial arrhythmias.
33 y/o male with PMH significant for AVR, NIDDM, h/o polysubstance abuse, initially admitted to OSH on [**2674-5-19**] for s/p tonic-clonic seizure resulting in a fall and broke right hip requiring R hip ORIF on [**2674-5-25**]. It was felt that seizure was secondary to benzo withdrawal as pt was taking 5 mg of Xanax tid at home. He was then to d/c'd to transitional care rehab on [**2674-5-27**] to be later admitted on [**2674-5-28**] for AMS/seizures. In the ED at OSH, loaded with 1 gm dilantin, 2 mg ativan, and 2 mg dilaudid and admitted. Per records, pt not on benzos while at rehab. EEG from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] showed no localizing seizure activity. On [**2674-5-31**], pt became lethargic, tachypneic w/rr in 40's and hypoxic. He was also reportedly febrile (unknown temp). He received one dose of CTX which resulted in a skin rash. He was then transferred to the ICU with concerns for NMS vs. sertonin syndrome vs. benzo-withdrawal vs. infection/sepsis. ICU course at OSH notable for start of ativan gtt and psychotropic meds, including risperdal, seroquel, wellbutrin, and xanaflex. WBC count at 11, Cr 4.4, LFTs wnl at that time. Dilantin level 7.7 at that time. Daily head CT's from [**5-29**] to [**5-31**] were all normal. During this time, pt became hyperkalemic to 5.4 and acidotic with bicarb of 18. ABG on [**2674-5-31**] was 7.2/24/72/16. Pt was then started on a bicarb gtt. Lactate was 1.2, serum and urine tox unremarkable except for benzos. Pt was ROMI with enzymes during his course. TTE today showed preserved EF, moderate AS/AI, moderate MR, elevated RV pressures of 91.
Patient is an 85 year old woman with past medical history of hypertension, hypercholesterolinemia, and vertebral aneurysm who presents with dizziness.  She awoke on the morning of admission with sense of dizziness and dysequilibrium like things were moving around her. The sensation was worsened with head movements and present in all positions. She denied any nausea, diplopia, or neck pain. When she walked, felt unsteady and had to hold onto things to steady herself. She then had developed a pain which she is unable to characterize further all over her head that build up to [**9-3**] but is now [**5-4**]. She also complained of photophobia but denied any visual, speaking, or swallowing difficulties.  Of note, she did have a cough but no fever in past week.  She denied any recent trauma or neck manipulations. Her neighbor came over and then called 911; patient was then taken to [**Hospital 5794**] hospital where she was found to be hypertensive to 200/100. A non-contrast head CT was negative and she refused spinal tap.  Records indicated that she was hospitalized two weeks ago at this [**Location (un) 614**] for dizziness and hypertension. Patient says that she has been having dizzy spells with sitting and standing up.  The spells last a few minutes.  Patient had MRI/MRA of head for these dizzy spells 6 months ago which showed aneurysm in the "cavernous."  She saw a Neurosurgeon at [**Hospital3 5795**] who told her surgery not indicated at that time.
This 62 year old patient with previous coronary artery bypass grafting in [**3022**] presented at this time with symptoms of chest pain and dyspnea on exertion.  He was investigated and was found to have residual disease in the obtuse marginal graft and also severe aortic stenosis and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.  He had no viable leg veins to be used as conduits and hence preoperatively, the obtuse marginal vein graft was stented successfully and he was electively admitted for aortic valve replacement with or without mitral valve repair or replacement.
74M on coumadin for a fib s/p unwitnessed fall down several flights of stairs, +LOC.  He was uncertain about any precipitating symptoms & does not remember event at all.  He complained of LBP & R leg pain on arrival to ED & soon thereafter developed paresthesias of the arms, as well as weakness of the right foot while in the ED.
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of left breast cancer.  She underwent a mastectomy followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. She finished her radiotherapy in [**3068-10-15**]. She presented to Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] interested in breast reconstruction and was admitted to the hospital for [**Last Name (un) 5809**] (deep inferior epigastric perforator) flap reconstruction to her left chest wall.
Patient is a 70 year old female with past medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, CVA, and breast cancer who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-3**]. Per report from the emergency room physicians, her daughter went to visit the patient today and noted the patient was cold, breathing fast, and felt unwell. EMS was called, and upon arrival the patient was noted to be tachypneic with a respiratory rate to the 40's, cold, sweaty, and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 70/palp. EMS was unable to obtain a temperature or start an IV in the field. . Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient was noted to be tachypneic, and was placed on a non-rebreather. The ED staff had a difficult time obtaining a blood pressure (erratic and felt to be erroneous readings of 190's obtained), and ultimately a mannual cuff provided [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1116**] of systolic of 85. Again it was difficult to place a peripheral IV, so a left EJ was placed. Ultimately a femoral central line was placed, as with her persistent tachypnea a neck line was felt unsafe. Her breathing improved to a rate in the 20's, and she was placed on nasal cannula oxygen with a saturation in the 90's. She received three liters of intravenous fluid. A chest x-ray was felt to possibly be consistent with pneumonia, so she was given levofloxacin, zosyn, and vancomycin to cover for possible aspiration and hospital-acquired pathogens given her recent stay. Of note, she remained hypothermic and a rectal probe was unable to read a temperature. With warm blankets, her temperature improved to 92 rectally at time of transfer. Her labs were notable for a lactate of 9.5, troponin at her baseline (0.06), and a bump in her creatinine to 2.3 (previously 1.4). . Upon arrival to the floor, patient denies any discomfort or pain, but states she feels cold. She cannot provide any details regarding the events leading to hospitalization.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a pleasant 54 yo gentleman with h/o longstanding atrial fibrillation and single kidney who presents to the CCU after becoming hypotensive during pulmonary vein isolation procedure. . Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5819**] atrial fibrillation had been well-controlled on flecainide until recently, when he began experiencing episodes of symptomatic tachycardia despite taking his medication faithfully.  During his pulmonary vein isolation procedure today, his blood pressure dropped to 68/55.  He was given IV fluids with increase in BP to 94/71, and his heparin gtt was reversed with protamine 25mg.  Stat echocardiogram revealed pericardial effusion, and patient underwent urgent pericardiocentesis with removal of 400cc of serous fluid from the pericardial space.  BP at end of procedure was 111/64, and he was transferred to the ICU intubated and with his pericardial drain in place.  He continued to have good urine output throughout the event. . Shortly after his transfer to the ICU, he was successfully extubated.  He reports some discomfort in his chest where the drain is in place, worse with taking a deep breath.  He is otherwise comfortable. .

The patient is a 29-year-old G5 P1-1-3-2 thin African-American female with a large symptomatic fibroid uterus, complaining of prolonged menometrorrhagia as well as severe pelvic pain, who presented with severe anemia with a hematocrit of 25. The patient was being evaluated by her PCP for suspected underlying thalassemia. Iron studies revealed severe iron-deficiency anemia, however the patient was not compliant with p.o. iron. Given the source of anemia was likely due to her fibroid uterus, the patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells 1 day preoperatively, as well as 125 mg of Ferrlecit IV to try to improve her iron stores and blood supply. The patient was offered to delay the surgery to improve her iron stores with p.o. iron, however the patient had been noncompliant and declined this option. The risks of infection with blood transfusion, as well as the side effects of blood transfusion, were discussed with the patient at length. The patient was counseled extensively and she opted for the preop transfusion and IV iron, and to proceed with the surgery.  Even after the patient was transfused the 2units of packed red blood cells, her post-transfusion heamtocrit was only 27 since she continued to bleed heavily from her uterine fibroids since the last HCT of 25.
The patient is a 70-year-old female with known history of coronary artery disease referred for outpatient cardiac catheterization secondary to a positive stress test.  The patient had a PTCA stent to the right coronary artery on [**3258-4-27**].

This is an 85-year-old woman with history of hypertension, who was admitted to an outside hospital prior to being admitted to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**12-29**].  At the outside hospital the patient had investigation for two month history of abdominal pain which showed mainly epigastric.  This work-up included abdominal CT which showed thickened duodenal valve, 2 cm adrenal mass, question of colon lesion consistent with intermittent intestinal obstruction.  Her CEA at the outside hospital was 41.  She was admitted to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**12-29**] with worsening of the abdominal epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting for two days.  In the hospital the patient had work-up which included CT angiogram due to abnormal EKG initially which revealed pulmonary embolism and patient had been started on Heparin.  Her initial EKG revealed T wave inversion at V2 and V6 plus ST depression so she was also admitted for rule out MI.  CT also revealed dilated common bile duct up to 18 mm.  Her hematocrit on admission was 29.0 and drifted to 22.5 on [**12-30**].  She had two episodes of coffee ground emesis on [**12-30**], became hypotensive and bradycardic and acute EGD was performed which revealed grade 3 esophagitis in the lower third, ulcer in the stomach, body and antrum, blood in the stomach and anterior vault.  There was large oozing clot in the duodenal bulb.  Hemostasis was achieved with Epinephrine injection.  Anticoagulation was discontinued and patient was started on Protonix drip and had been transferred to medical Intensive Care Unit due to hypotension and active bleeding. The same day she had IVC filter placed which was done on [**12-31**].  The patient received two units of FFP followed by 6 units of packed red blood cells.  On [**12-31**] the patient was transferred back to the medicine floor and on [**1-1**] she had a second EGD done due to hematocrit of 33.6 which drifted to 32.2.  EGD at that time revealed esophagitis, ulcers in the antrum which were injected with Epinephrine and also posterior bulb injection and thermal therapy, a large inferior posterior duodenal ulcer with oozing refractory to injection.  For this reason the patient underwent angiography revealing the source of bleeding and underwent duodenal gastric artery embolization.  She was then transferred with additional two units packed red blood cells.  Her hematocrit after transfusion went to 38.5 on [**1-2**]. Other studies during the hospital course included chest x-ray which revealed widened mediastinum secondary to tortuous and dilated thoracic aorta and bibasilar atelectasis.  CTA revealed moderate intra and extrahepatic ductal dilatation, left pulmonary artery embolism and left adrenal mass. Ultrasound of the lower extremities revealed no DVT, KUB revealed no obstruction and chest x-ray on [**1-3**] revealed bilateral small pleural effusion with consolidation of the lower lobe presenting either atelectasis or infection.  She was transferred to general medicine floor on [**1-3**].

His BP dropped to 70/30, and he received 5 L of NS, levophed started after 3 L and SBP 85. A-line placed - ABG - 7.40/26/137, and the lactate improved to 1.5. He started making urine with up to 60 cc per hour. He was admitted to the MICU. He was continued on the sepsis protocol in the MICU and transfused with 2 units of blood for a HCT of 18. He was weaned from levophedrine around 4 am and has since had a stable BP in the 110's. Patient was then transferred to floor on [**12-29**], at that time he reported feeling much improved, but not quite at his baseline. He denies continued fevers or chills, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or other concerns. He says he is currently almost blind from the CMV retinitis, and [**Doctor Last Name **] detect some light in his left eye.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6046**] was a 60-year-old right handed African American male who was admitted on [**3111-3-27**] with history of acute left weakness.  He had a past medical history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and prior stroke.  He presented to the Emergency Room with sudden onset left sided weakness said by report occurring approximately 30 minutes before presenting to the Emergency Room.  The patient was a patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6047**], and the patient stated at that moment he takes Coumadin for prior strokes. The patient vomited and aspirated coming back from CT scan, and drove his O2 saturation transiently to the 60s requiring intubation for airway protection.
66 yo M with mechanical AVR on [**First Name3 (LF) **], with aortic valve enterococcal endocarditis and ring abscess, and recent GIB ([**2745-10-1**]) after colonic polypectomy s/p 7 units pRBC and INR reversal, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for management of hypotension and AVR abscess. . On arrival in the MICU, his hypotension had been resolved. His Hct remained stable, and he was placed on heparin drip for anticoagulation. His EKG showed PR prolongation to 400 msec. Repeat TEE showed heterogeneous thickening of the peri-aortic tissue consistent with an aortic root abscess. EP, cardiothorasic surgery, and ID were consulted. EP and CSURG felt that this could be conservatively managed until surgery, and recommends rehab with regular EKG. ID recommended amp + gent for treatment which was started. Patient was hemodynamically stable and transferred to the floor. . ROS: No fevers, chills, nightsweats. No chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath. No abdominal pain. No urinary symptoms. No weakness in the extremities. No nausea/vomiting/diarrhea. Had resolution of dark stools and no more episodes of bright red blood per rectum.
66M w h/o bicuspid aortic valve, s/p mechanical AVR (on [**Male First Name (un) **]) in [**2729**] at [**Hospital1 18**].  The ascending aorta was noted to be 4.5cm at the time, and was not replaced.  He had an episode of enterococcal aortic valve endocarditis in [**2745-1-9**]. Enterococcal endocarditis was again diagnosed in [**2745-9-9**] with concern for aortic valve ring abscess on echo.  The patient was evaluated for the source of his enterococcal bacteremia and mild ischemic colitis and several polyps were found. A polypectomy was performed. An EGD found mild gastritis and he was started on Pantprazole. The patient was discharged on ampicillin and gentamicin on [**2745-9-20**]. He was admitted on [**2745-11-6**] for preoperative workup and cardiac cath.  Cardiac cath did not reveal obstructive coronary lesiosn. On admission, the patient exhibited gait instability and neurology was consulted.  It was determined that the patient was experiencing vestibulopathy secondary to gentamycin.  MRI revealed very small microembolic infarcts which were attributed to his time off [**Date Range **] resulting in subtherapeutic INR, or, less likely, septic emboli.  Gentamicin was discontinued and the patient was discharged home on ampicillin, which will continue until surgery.  ID has continued to follow him as an outpatient with weekly blood cultures.  The patient returns for heparin bridge preoperatively.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6117**] is a 77 year old, Russian-speaking man with known coronary artery disease, with a one year history of worsening chest pain, now with unstable angina, scheduled for cardiac catheterization in [**3328-12-4**], after a positive stress test.  The patient elected to postpone the procedure at that time.  The patient presented to the Emergency Room on [**3-31**] with a complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath.
The patient is an 83 year-old white male with a history of large left sided lung mass who recently had a biopsy who presented with mental status changes and vomiting followed by hypoxemia.  He had a biopsy of his lung mass on [**2686-3-5**].  On the day prior to admission the patient complained of pain at his biopsy site, which is controlled with Percocet.  On the morning of admission he developed a fever to 101.7 degrees Fahrenheit rectally.  His O2 sats were 90% on 2.5 liters nasal cannula. A chest x-ray revealed left upper lobe and right lower lobe infiltrates and the patient was started on Levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia.  Later that day he gradually became more lethargic and required more pain medication.  After the one episode of vomiting the patient's O2 sats fell to the 80s on 2.5 liters per minute nasal cannula and he was 92% on 8 liters of nasal cannula.  He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 1426**] for further management.  On arrival the patient required 100% nonrebreather face mask to keep his O2 sats in the high to mid 90s.  A chest x-ray revealed left lower lobe collapse and consolidation with an additional infiltrate around the mass and a moderate sized left pleural effusion.  He was given a dose of Levofloxacin and Flagyl in the Emergency Department.  Arterial blood gas on a nonrebreather mask revealed pH at 7.2 on oxygen, CO2 of 80 and oxygen of 125.  A trial of BIPAP was attempted, however, the patient could not tolerate the mask.  He was then placed back on a nonrebreather with almost identical arterial blood gas of 7.20, 79, and 125.  The MICU team was then called to evaluate the patient.
The patient had been experiencing intermittent back pain over the past week who has a well known history of osteoarthritis of the spine.  He was given Percocet for pain control without improvement in his symptomatology.

The patient is a 54 year old male with end-stage renal disease secondary to post-Streptococcal glomerular nephritis and CPDD, and adrenal insufficiency, who presented with two to three weeks of lower abdominal pain and was found to be Clostridium difficile positive.  Upon work-up the patient showed worsening abdominal CT scan consistent with pan-colitis. The patient was initially treated with Vancomycin intravenously with p.o. Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl.  On [**3295-11-21**], the patient was found to be gasping for air while on 100% non-rebreather mask with an arterial blood gases of 7.04, 80, 43.  The patient was immediately intubated and admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at which time the patient was found to have atrial fibrillation with heart rate between 100 to 140.  Rate was very difficult to control and Diltiazem drip was initiated. On [**3295-11-20**], the patient's heart rate remained between 90 to 110 with Diltiazem drip at 10 mg per hour and blood pressure was also difficult to maintain.  The patient responded well initially to boluses with decrease in tachycardia, however, due to the worsening pan-colitis, the patient was taken back to the Operating Room for a subtotal colectomy. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  N/A. SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 55 year old male status post subtotal colectomy and end-ileostomy for infarcted small intestine and colitis with pseudomembranes. The patient was initiated on broad-spectrum antibiotics with cultures sent.  The patient's CT scan of the abdomen indicated a diffuse thickening of terminal ileum and large intestine to the transverse colon without stranding. A repeat CT scan immediately prior to the subtotal colectomy indicated pan-colitis which progressed from prior scan but no evidence of perforation. Immediately postoperatively, the patient continued to have respiratory distress requiring increased pressor support and required continued transfusion with seven units both of P, two units of packed red blood cells and four liters of Crystalloid. Despite the continued resuscitation, the patient remained hypotensive with continued lactic acidosis requiring bicarbonate replacement.  The aggressive resuscitation continued until [**3295-11-28**], when after a long discussion with the family members, the patient was made comfort measures only. The patient developed a ventricular fibrillation shortly thereafter and expired later on that evening. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post subtotal colectomy and ileostomy. DISPOSITION:   Death.

This 53-year-old female with past medical history significant for Stage III-B nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed in fall of [**3086**] with recurrent C, Factor VIII deficiency, and epilepsy, who presents with hemoptysis, and excessive secretions status post right main bronchus stent removal.  Originally patient was diagnosed with nonsmall cell lung cancer in fall of [**3086**], and was treated with XRT and chemotherapy with carboplatin and Taxol. Her disease reoccurred in [**3088-2-26**], and she was again treated with XRT with minimal response.  The lung cancer had then progressed. On [**3090-2-24**], the patient underwent bronchoscopy (via cytology revealed nonsmall cell lung cancer) with stent placement in the bronchus intermedius.  Poststent CT demonstrated adequate placement.  However, the patient was unable to tolerate the stent with persistent cough and increased secretions.  She presents today for elective stent removal.  The procedure was complicated by 150 cc of hemoptysis poststent removal which was controlled with suctioning and airway protection. On arrival, the patient complains of shortness of breath with increased nonbloody secretions which is improved with nebulized lidocaine.  She also complains of mild anterior right chest discomfort which is chronic and pleuritic.  She denies any nausea, vomiting, headache, chills.
This is a pleasant 55 year-old man who reported a vague "burning" feeling in his chest that began in [**Month (only) 202**] of this year. He also reports an associated mild SOB. This burning sensation has occurred with activity such as walking up a steep incline or even on a flat surface, occasionally depending on what he had just eaten. Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6186**] also notes the burning sensation has occurred at rest, but can be postural - depending on if he is sitting vs. laying down. The patient often associates most of these symptoms with his GERD. Finally, the patient also reports a tightness in the area of his heart that was also tender to touch. This has occurred with and without activity, with stress and could last up to one day. On [**2877-12-14**], the patient underwent an ETT for CP evaluation. The patient for 5.25 minutes of a modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol to an APHR of 65% and was stopped for fatigue. At peak exercise, EKG showed 1-1.5mm of horizontal ST segment depression in II and lateral leads. These changes turned to downsloping by 3 minutes post-exercise, and returned to baseline by 7 minutes of recovery. The rhythm was sinus without ectopy. Gated images revealed a large, reversible, moderate intensity perfusion defect involving the PDA territory. Small, reversible, severe perfusion defect involving the LAD territory. Transient cavity dilation c/w severe multi-vessel disease. Moderate LV systolic dysfunction (EF 34%), with apical and inferior hypokinesis, c/w post-stress running. On [**2877-12-23**], patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed severe three vessel disease and depressed left ventricular function at 35%. Coronary angiography showed a right dominant system with 90% stenosis of the LAD and total occlusions of the second obtuse marginal and mid right coronary artery. PCI of the RCA was attempted but unsuccessful. He was therefore referred for cardiac surgical intervention.
This is a 17 year old male who was playing football at 330 pm today when he hit his head against another player.  There was no loss of consciousness.  The patient was brought to [**Hospital3 6187**] and has had 3 episodes of vomiting since the accident. He reported ringing in the ears immediately after the accident. The head Ct at the OSH was consistent with possible epidural hematoma per the OSH. The patient was transferred here for further treatment and evaluation. Currently, the patient denies nausea, numbness, tingling, weakness, or bowel and bladder dysfunction. He has a headache a level 2 on a [**2-9**] pain scale.
Patient is a 71 year old male with history of bilateral spontaneous pneumothoraces, LUL blebectomy, found to have a LLL PNA on admission. He presented with c/o six days of fatigue and productive cough and a day of L sided pleuritic chest pain. On the day PTA, he was seen by his PCP who prescribed him a tetracycline. In the ED, the patient was saturating 100%RA and CXR revealed a LLL infiltrate, so he was started on Levofloxacin. His initial BP was 94/47 so he was given 2 L of NS, causing his oxygen saturation to drop to the low 90s on NC. His SBP transiently dropped to 67/32 and improved to the 90s-100s systolic after another L of NS. He was noted to have diffuse rales, and was given CTX 1 gm IVx1 and started on CPAP. . In the MICU, he was quickly weaned to 2 L NC and his SBP came up to the 100s. He received Lasix 10 mg IV x1. He was continued on levofloxacin for treatment of PNA. His Creatinine improved from 1.7 back down to 1.3 after IV hydration. TTE performed on [**2534-11-3**] showed a normal EF of 55% and no focal wall motion abnormalities (although a poor quality study). Prior to transfer, he was satting 95% 2LNC at rest, but would desat to 84% on 3LNC with ambulation. He remained afebrile in the MICU, SBP 90s-110s, and HR 45-55. . At this time, the patient states he continues still have a mild left lower chest pain with inspiration (improved from prior). He also continues to have a productive cough with yellow sputum. His appetite is improving again and his headaches have resolved. . Review of Systems: He reports several pounds of weight loss over the past week.

This is a 73-year-old female who presented with three days of progressive sore throat and odynophagia. The symptoms began three days prior to admission with upper respiratory infection like syndrome including a mild cough without sputum, a stuffy nose, and sore throat.  There were no fevers or chills.  Over the last two days prior to admission, there was worsening left throat pain and odynophagia with decreased oral intake; although normal vocal quality with no air hunger or dyspnea. She came to the Emergency Department on the morning of admission and a fiberoptic scope was done that showed no obvious swelling.  There was normal vocal cord function and excessive secretions noted.   A computed tomography scan of the neck with contrast showed soft tissue thickening at the left hypopharynx. Ear/Nose/Throat Service saw the patient in the Emergency Department and repeated the fiberoptic laryngoscopy which showed an injected epiglottis without swelling, markedly swollen left retinoid at the AE fold, and normal vocal cords. The air flow was felt to be "adequate but borderline."  The diagnosis of supraglottitis was made, and it was recommended to initiate Decadron 10 mg intravenously q.8h. times three doses.  The first dose was given in the Emergency Department. Clindamycin 600 mg intravenously q.8h. was also given.  She was given morphine for pain control as well as Dilaudid which relieved her pain but made her extremely groggy.  In light of the severity of her infection as well as her decreased mental status, she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for observation.

On presentation, he had left lower extremity weakness following the unwitnessed fall at home.  By patient's family report, he fell on Saturday afternoon having been home alone all day and was found later that afternoon by his wife.  She managed to arouse him and move him to a recliner but no further action was taken.  Following the fall, the patient was in his usual state of health until the following evening on Sunday when, by family's report, had had a sudden and profound weakness of the left lower extremity while walking.  The wife is said to have carried the patient back to his bed and the EMS was activated. On presentation to the Emergency Department, the patient was lethargic with confusion beyond his normal baseline dementia. Through a translator, he is oriented to place and recognizes face although he can be difficult to arouse at times. By family report there was no noticeable change in visual or speech patterns and the patient appears to comprehend them. They do, however, report that he has had difficulty moving food to his face. MEDICATIONS:  The patient presented to the Emergency Department on no chronic medications. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On presentation to the Emergency Department, vital signs are a blood pressure of 153/78; pulse 94; temperature 99.8 F.; respirations 16; saturation of 96% on room air.  In general, Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a healthy appearing gentleman in no acute distress.  He appears comfortable, does not speak in English but communicates effectively through his daughter, who is employed in the [**Name (NI) **] Medical System. HEENT:  Eyes are equal and reactive to light.  There is no evidence of scleral icterus.  Neck is supple without masses or lymphadenopathy.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart shows a regular rate and rhythm, no S1 or S2.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities show no evidence of edema bilaterally.  Neurological examination shows the patient to be awake, alert and attentive and oriented times two.  Family endorses that this is indeed his baseline, again through the interpreter his speech is fluent and follows commands.  Cranial nerves examination reveals pupils to be equal and reactive to light, showing 2.5 mm to 1.5 mm bilaterally; extraocular muscles are full.  Facial movement is symmetric except for a slight decrease in the left nasal labial fold.  Tongue protrudes to the midline.   Motor examination shows the patient to have full strength in his biceps, triceps, grips, IP, AT and G on the right.  On the left, he is five out of five biceps, four plus out of five triceps, four out of five grips, four minus out of five IP, four minus out of five AT and four to five G. There is evidence of a left pronator drift.  Reflexes are two plus throughout.  Coordination is intact.  Sensation likewise is intact with appropriate proprioception. LABORATORY STUDIES:  On presentation, the patient's chem-7 was a sodium of 138, potassium 3.5, chloride 99, CO2 30, BUN 22, creatinine 1.1, glucose 130.  Hematocrit was 37.9, white blood cell count was 11.8 and platelets were 16.7.  PT was 13.0, PTT 24.2, INR 2.1. A CT scan without contrast of the head performed upon presentation to the Emergency Department showed evidence of a subdural hematoma at 1.4 cm at its maximum with areas of lower attenuations suggesting subacute and organizing hemorrhage.  There is a small amount of mass effect also noted with a left shift by 5 mm.  There was no evidence of herniation and no evidence of fractures.  The presence of opacification at the frontal and ethmoidal sinuses also is consistent with sinusitis. HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**3405-8-20**], the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit after a two to three hour stay in the Emergency Department.  On the morning of [**3405-8-20**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room and underwent a right craniotomy for evacuation of subdural hematoma.  The case was unremarkable and there were no complications noted. Following surgery, the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  On presentation to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient's vital signs were all stable and he was started on prophylactic Dilantin.  In the days following the surgery, the patient remained neurologically stable with
This is a 78 yo Cantonese speaking right handed man with a history of vascular dementia, stroke with left sided weakness, HTN, h/o right SDH s/p evacuation who was in his usual state of health until this morning.  He walked to the bathroom and did not come out for 20 minutes.  His wife got worried and walked in to find him curled up on the bathroom floor.  He said,"I'm fine" and denied any pain, headache.  She and a friend tried to sit him up but were unable.  [**Name (NI) **] son (who lives downstairs) came up and sat him up.  Over the course of several hours the wife noticed he became more quiet, and it wasn't clear if he was understanding her.  Then, he was unable to lift his right arm although still could wiggle his right fingers.  This is odd because his right side is usually his stronger side given his old stroke and resultant left sided weakness.  This weakness prompted the call to EMS.  In the ED, CT scan was performed, 5mg IV hydral was given for elevated BP, followed by labetolol drip. Upon review of systems, no new meds, no alternative meds, he takes a daily aspirin, no fevers, chills, illnesses, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain.  He has baseline urgency of urine and stool for the past year or so, and has to run to the bathroom quickly. At baseline, he no longer reads or writes, paucity of speech - talks in one or two word sentences when spoken to, ambulates with a walker, wife is the sole care giver and he requires assistance with all ADLS (grooming, bathing, dressing, feeding). Has very poor short term memory.
A 68-year-old ophthalmologist with no significant past medical history, who presents today with diffuse muscle pain and dyspnea on exertion times six days.  Symptoms started when patient awoke six days prior to admission with lumbar lower back pain.  Patient states that initially the pain was similar to lumbar back pain in the past, however, he usually notices this type of pain at the end of the day rather than first thing in the morning. Throughout the day his lower back pain worsened and patient began to note diffuse myalgias.  Upon getting home from work that evening, he reports that the pain and myalgias were so severe that he was unable to walk.  The weakness has worsened throughout the course of the week, and patient has been nonambulatory. His dyspnea on exertion began around the same time as the muscle weakness and prior to being unable to walk, he was only able to do three steps before he became tachypneic.  He does not report any PND or orthopnea. The patient has also recently traveled to [**State 107**] approximately 10 days ago.  While he was in [**State 107**], he had an acute diarrheal illness, which was described as watery and nonbloody.  This resolved spontaneously and was self limited. He was unclear if this was associated with fevers. Five days prior to admission, he again had recurrence of symptoms and his diarrhea in addition to above symptoms of myalgias and weakness.  His original episode of diarrhea was thought to be secondary to eating out at a restaurant with Cuban cuisine and possible beef exposure.  He does not believe he had any fresh water exposure and he was not swimming in any pools. On presentation to the Emergency Department, he was noted to be in moderate respiratory distress with respiratory rates in the 30s and tachycardic with heart rates in the 100s.  He was placed on nonrebreather face mask with initial oxygen saturation 88 percent, which improved to 95 percent on 3 liters without any intervention.  Initial ABG showed 7.33/21/134 on unknown amount of oxygen.  He received 2 liters of  intravenous normal saline while in the Emergency Department and had development of bibasilar rales.  He did not have any change in his oxygen saturation while lying supine. On review of systems, patient complains of mild oliguria, which he reports usually going 10 times per day, which decreased to one time per day over the last six days.  He noted brown urine starting approximately four days ago.  He has not had any dysuria or hematuria as far as he knows.  He also reports a sore throat with a question of dysarthria at the onset of symptoms five to six days ago.  He has had a headache and some blurry vision.  The blurry vision was approximately two days prior to admission and lasted about 24 hours.  One day prior to admission he believes he also had an episode of diplopia, which lasted approximately six hours. He has not had any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or palpitations.  Of note, he and his wife, who is also a physician noted that his thighs were mottled.
57 year old male has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and insulin dependent diabetes. He has been fairly sedentary over the past year and recently began to notice that he was having dyspnea with activities that he previously could do without problems, including climbing a flight of stairs or walking up a slight incline. At times, this has been associated with mild left sided chest discomfort. Recent stress echo revealed ischemia c/w three vessel disease or LM disease. He was referred for cardiac catheterization to further evaluate. He was found to have multivessel disease and is now being referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization.
89 yo male who presented with chills at dialysis.  He was noted to have a fever to 102 at that time.  While at dialysis, he was noted to have a ulceration over his left AV graft site with bleeding.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and work-up of a likely infected left AV graft.

This is a 78 year old woman with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ulcerative colitis, status post ileostomy in [**3471**], aortic stenosis, status post valvuloplasty in [**3471**], and then aortic valve replacement with a porcine aortic valve in [**3472**], and a left below the knee amputation in [**3439**], who has had one week of cough and sputum production that was treated with Levaquin and Flagyl. Two days prior to admission, the patient developed nausea and vomiting and stopped taking her Flagyl but still had nausea. She stopped being able to eat well and had some respiratory distress and had diarrhea.  She was sent to the Emergency Department for evaluation.  She denied any chest pain, denied any blood in the diarrhea, denied any blood in her vomit, denied fever, chills. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival in the Emergency Department, the patient's examination revealed she was an uncomfortable dyspneic woman on oxygen via nasal cannula who had to pause while speaking secondary to her dyspnea.   She was afebrile.  Her blood pressure was 116/60 with a pulse of 86, respiratory rate 20s with oxygen saturation of 95% in room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - She was normocephalic and atraumatic with no icterus.  Her mucous membranes were dry.  She had no jugular venous distention. Her chest had basilar crackles bilaterally, diffusely decreased breath sounds.  The heart was regular.  She had a III/VI midsystolic murmur.  Her abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.  The ileostomy bag was in place.  Her extremities revealed status post left below the knee amputation.  Her right lower extremity was cool with chronic erythema and venous stasis changes and trace edema. LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count 13.9, hematocrit 42.5, platelets 308,000. INR 2.1.  Chem7 revealed a sodium of 136, potassium 5.7, chloride 111, bicarbonate 6, blood urea nitrogen 120, creatinine 3.0, glucose 110.  A troponin was less than 0.3.  Urinalysis had 30 protein, specific gravity of 1.016, three white cells, two red cells and a few bacteria. ALT was 8, AST 20, alkaline phosphatase 102, total bilirubin 0.4, amylase 111, CK 53. Her chest x-ray showed no congestive heart failure and no pneumonia.  Arterial blood gases at that time revealed pH 7.21, pCO2 22, pO2 153. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute. Q wave in III, aVF and V2, 1.[**Street Address(2) 2766**] depressions in II, V3 through V6.  T wave inversions in I, II, aVL, V4 through V6 and biphasic in V3. HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for correction of her metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure and for ruling out acute myocardial infarction. 1.  Metabolic acidosis - She was given three amps of bicarbonate in one liter of fluid.  She had blood cultures drawn.  She was treated with oxygen.  Calcium, phosphorus and magnesium levels were drawn and found to be low.  She was repleted with those intravenously and her acidosis responded so that on the day of transfer to the floor, her bicarbonate was 19 and she was able to tolerate p.o. 2.  Acute renal failure - She had a creatinine of 3.0 when her baseline is 1.1.  This responded well to intravenous fluid hydration so that on the day of transfer to the floor her creatinine was 1.8 and on the day of discharge from the hospital her creatinine was 1.3. It was thought that both metabolic acidosis and the acute renal failure were secondary to severe volume depletion from diarrhea and decreased p.o. intake.  She has responded well to intravenous rehydration and repletion of her electrolytes. 3.  Rule out myocardial infarction - Serial CKs were done which were negative.  Her troponin was always less than 0.3. Despite the changes on the electrocardiogram, she was found not to have had a myocardial infarction.  It was thought that these changes were secondary to some ischemia probably induced by the volume depletion. 4.  Respiratory - She began to have some increasing shortness of breath on the day of transfer to the floor and stated that at home she takes Albuterol nebulizer twice a day.  These were started on the floor and her breathing improved.  She continued on her normal respiratory medications, inhalers and was continued on b.i.d. nebulizers. 5.  Gastrointestinal - The patient presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and decreased p.o. intake.  Over her hospital stay, the diarrhea decreased and her stools became
The patient is a 78-year-old female with history of ulcerative colitis status post ileostomy in [**3461**] with severe COPD and a past admission for severe diarrhea which led to acute renal failure, who was in her usual state of health until 4-5 days prior to admission when a VNA nurse noted increased output from her ostomy.  She also was complaining of decreased po intake and post tussive vomiting at that time.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] went to the patient's house on the day of admission and felt she should come to the Emergency Room for evaluation.  She was also stating that she had a slight increase in shortness of breath above baseline. In the Emergency Room she was orthostatic but afebrile and was found to have acute renal failure with a BUN of 71, creatinine up to 3.8 and a potassium of 6.6.  ABG at that time showed PH of 7.18, PCO2 31 and a PO2 of 114.  EKG showed peaked T waves.  She was given bicarbonate and Albuterol nebs and hydrated with four liters of normal saline.  She then was transferred to the MICU for further care.
Eighty-year-old female with history of end-stage COPD, aortic valve replacement, and nursing home residency brought to Emergency Room from nursing home after complaining of increased chest pressure and unresponsive with nitroglycerin and increasing shortness of breath with a productive cough of white sputum.  The patient has chronic chest pain, but usually responds to nitroglycerin.  The patient has chronic shortness of breath with cough, but more so since [**9-22**], at which point she was seen by her PCP and started on levofloxacin. The shortness of breath increased with chest pressure since that point, and she called for help because she thought she was having a heart attack.  In the Emergency Room, the patient had chest pressure and EKG showed evidence of an old inferior MI and rate related ST-T wave changes.  The patient also had increased blood pressure up to 220/100 with a heart rate of 116.  The patient was started on nitroglycerin drip, given Lasix 40 mg IV x1, multiple albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers, Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV x1, and Zestril 20 mg p.o. x1 in the ED. The patient had an ABG showing a pH of 7.17, a CO2 of 75, and an oxygen of 96 on nasal cannula, and was started on BiPAP at that point.  The VBG on BiPAP was a pH of 7.23, CO2 64, and oxygen 172.  Patient was then switched to 1 liter/minute nasal cannula and had an ABG of 7.25, 58, and 74. Patient was observed to be in respiratory distress with tachycardia, and the decision was made to restart BiPAP and observe in the MICU.

However, it was confirmed that the family does not want surgery and thus the patient did not have a formal [**Doctor First Name **] consult.  BPs were briefly low in the ED and the patient was started on levophed. However after further discussions with the family it was determined that the family would like to direct the care more towards comfort and the levofed was stopped. . Upon arrival to the MICU the patient appeared to be in pain. After extensive family discussion, they decided that the patient should not be intubated and would not be a candidate for surgery.  Additionally they would like to keep the patient comfortable.
Patient is a 58-year-old man with history of coronary artery disease status post inferior myocardial infarction [**2849-3-5**] with stent to the right coronary artery, angioplasty to the obtuse marginal in [**Month (only) 354**] of '[**49**], stent to the right coronary artery in [**2850-10-5**], angioplasty to the posterolateral branch of the right coronary artery in [**2852-5-5**], who presented with unstable angina x3 weeks to an outside hospital.  Patient states that he has been chest pain free for approximately seven years prior to approximately three weeks ago when his chest pain recurred. Patient reports that the chest pain was his typical angina, but mild compared to previous experiences and resolved with 1-2 nitroglycerin.  these symptoms sometimes occurred at rest over the past three weeks.  His episodes have increased in frequency over the past three weeks.  Patient denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting. On the evening of admission, the patient awoke from sleep with 9/10 chest pain and diaphoresis, and took six sublingual nitroglycerin as well as aspirin without resolution of chest pain, so he called ambulance.  Patient was brought to an outside hospital, where ECG changes showed inferior ST elevations and anterior ST depressions.  Patient received Heparin drip, Morphine, and nitroglycerin at the outside hospital and became chest pain free.  Patient also received Retavase at the outside hospital. Patient had been scheduled for elective cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 **], therefore he was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2859-1-31**] the same evening that he presented to the outside hospital.  In the ambulance upon transfer, patient had recurrent chest pain and received a second dose of Retavase.  The patient's inferior ST changes had resolved by the time he arrived at the Emergency Room at [**Hospital1 **] and he was originally pain free.  However, his pain recurred, and a repeat electrocardiogram showed ST elevations approximately 1 mm in the inferior leads, st depression in V1 and V2 and 1 & avl with t wave inversion in avl.The patient was therefore brought from the Emergency Room to the Coronary Cath Laboratory. At catheterization, the patient was found to have 80% mid left circ stenosis as well as 90% lesion in the RCA between two previous stents.  The patient received two hepacoat stents to his right coronary artery with good flow afterwards.  Patient was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further management.  Upon arrival at the Coronary Care Unit, the patient denied any symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath. Review of systems was notable for skin lesions that the patient states has been diagnosed as shingles.

The patient denied any shortness of breath, diaphoresis, palpitations.  He states that this pain is different from the pain that he had when he had his myocardial infarction.  When seen in the Emergency Room, the patient was given aspirin, morphine, heparin, and he was admitted to rule out myocardial infarction.  The patient's amylase and lipase were found to be elevated consistent with pancreatitis.
The patient is a 59 year old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, status post deep brain electrode placement who was transferred to [**Hospital1 341**] for atrial fibrillation and flutter with slow ventricular response and symptomatic bradycardia. On the day prior to admission, the patient noted an episode of dyspnea, weakness, and diaphoresis which was more severe than he had ever experienced before and was found by his nurse to have a heart rate in the 40s and systolic blood pressure in the 90s.  Electrocardiogram demonstrated atrial flutter with 5:1 block.  He was started on Dopamine to maintain his blood pressure and then entered a junctional rhythm.  He was then noted over the next 12 hours to go in and out of sinus as well as atrial fibrillation.  The patient has had recurrent symptoms of light-headedness and diaphoresis, but is not certain if they correlate with changes in his heart rhythms.  The patient's only new medications have been Kefzol and Terazosin.  He denies any fever or chills but has had chest tingling and numbness.  Of note, the patient had the power generators placed for his deep brain electrode stimulation on [**3381-6-7**], and they were recently turned on.

She does note eating a tuna [**Location (un) 5927**] at the nursing home last week, but denies feeling acutely ill after eating that. In the Emergency Department, her temperature was noted to be 102.2, heart rate of 89, creatinine of 1.4, and a BUN of 29. Baseline creatinine is 0.7.  Additionally, her urinalysis was notable for large blood, positive nitrites, moderate bacteria, [**1-25**] epis, greater than 300 proteinuria.  The patient received 2 liters of normal saline, Zofran, and one dose of levofloxacin upon admission.
The patient is a 65-year-old Russian-speaking female with a past medical history significant for hepatitis C cirrhosis, diabetes, and coronary artery disease who presents with fever and hypotension. On the day prior to admission, the patient had a routine cystoscopy.  She had taken Bactrim prophylaxis with this cystoscopy, but otherwise no antibiotic prophylaxis.  The next day, she noted a fever to 102.  She also had nausea and vomiting with emesis times one, and abdominal pain, and diarrhea.  She also noted fevers and chills with a temperature to 102.  She then presented to the Emergency Department. Her primary complaint at the time of Emergency Department evaluation was hematuria. A review of systems was significant for dysuria and frequency for the previous few days.  She also notes exercise-induced angina over the previous few months, but no active change in this.  She is otherwise without any complaints; including no cough or shortness of breath or chest pain. Upon arrival to the Emergency Department, the patient was noted to be febrile and mildly hypotensive.  She was enrolled in a sepsis protocol given her fever, leukocytosis, and a lactate greater than 4.  She was aggressively fluid resuscitated and received a total of 4 liters of normal saline.  Her blood pressure initially responded to fluid boluses but then trended down to the 90s systolic.  She was then started on Levophed for pressor support which had to be titrated up to 4 mcg a minute to maintain mean arterial pressures of greater than 60.  She was given ceftriaxone, and vancomycin, and levofloxacin as per sepsis protocol.  Her lactate did trend down to 1.4 following aggressive fluid resuscitation.  Her mixed venous oxygen saturations ranged from 82% to 89%.  Her central venous pressure was 10 cm when placed.  It subsequently ranged from 9 to 18, and at the time of Medical Intensive Care Unit evaluation was 8.  The patient was subsequently admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management given her presumed septic shock.

This is a 32 -year-old black male with a history of having been struck on the face approximately one week prior to admission and on the day of admission was found in his home to be unresponsive when family went to visit.  In retrospect, the family reported that he had been apparently somewhat abnormal behavior in the two to three days prior to being found.  He was taken by taxicab and family assistance to the [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] Emergency Room and on arrival he moved all extremities spontaneously, but was not following commands and was not opening his eyes. HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was intubated at that time and taken to the CT scan which showed a chronic and subacute subdural hematoma on the left side with a positive midline shift and positive trapped blood in the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 528**].  He was then taken to the Operating Room emergently where under general endotracheal anesthetic, he underwent a left frontal temporal craniotomy with evacuation of a subdural hematoma by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and assisted by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1008**]. Postoperatively he was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit and initially was found to have pupils of 3.0 mm, reacting minimally, and he was not following commands.  He had a positive swallow and gag reflex, but remained intubated overnight.  On the day following surgery, he was noted to be more easily arousable and would awaken and was oriented times three with extraocular movements full.  He was then extubated, had a benign postoperative course in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, was transferred out to the floor.  On the floor he required extensive physiotherapy, both for gait instability and impaired motor control and impaired balance. DISPOSITION:  He continued as an inpatient here at the [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] until discharge on [**8-6**], at which time he was noted to have a stable gait and was fully awake, alert, conversant, and appropriate, oriented to time, place, and person, and could ambulate very stable with the use of a cane for minimal assistance and security. Physiotherapy signed off on the patient on the morning of [**8-6**], and he was subsequently discharged home later on the morning of [**8-6**], with arrangements for follow-up in the outpatient clinic in approximately four weeks time.  All staples and skin sutures were removed prior to discharge. DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable and improved.

History of Present Illness: 63M with cigar smoking history and radiographically apparent diffuse metastatic disease (likely highly aggressive Stage IV Lung CA) who came to the ED, was intubated, and admitted to the unit for severe acidosis and respiratory support. Patient was in his USOH until about 1 month ago when he started experiencing SOB, weight loss (8lbs in 2 weeks), cough, gouty attacks in his toes, and right sided chest pain. He was initially evaluated in clinic [**3-10**] with a CXR and subsequent CT chest showing Left perihilar mass, mediastinal LAD, right pulmonary nodules, and what appear to be diffuse liver mets. He was seen by IP as an outpatient and had a thoracentesis [**3-22**] with cytology still pending. Over the last 2 days, his status has taken a turn for the worse. Per wife, he has become jaundiced with increasing shortness of breath. This morning he was apparently doing okay, by lunch time he was only able to speak [**12-20**] words at a time due to shortness of breath and by this evening he was unable to talk. His wife, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7155**], called the IP office regarding his symptoms and was referred to the ED for further management. .

The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of ventricular peritoneal shunt placement in [**2894-7-26**] for normal pressure hydrocephalus. The patient had a 6-week course of rehabilitation and was doing well.  He was recently having complaints of headaches.  He had a routine follow-up appointment and head computed tomography which showed bilateral subdural hygromas with a subacute component on the left frontal area .  The patient had a median pressure valve placed at the time of shunt placement.
Patient is a 77-year-old gentleman status post a right frontal VP shunt placement on [**2894-8-10**], who has been doing well until mid [**Month (only) **] when he began complaining of headache.  He was admitted to the [**Hospital3 **] at that time with a subdural hematoma.  The VP shunt was ligated, and the patient was discharged to rehab again.  Head CT at that time of D/C showed increased hydrocephalus, but stable. Patient was sent to rehab and became increasingly confused and not able to follow coherent streams of thought or commands.  Family called Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and felt that repeat head CT needed to be done which showed an increase in the subdural hematoma especially on the left to 3-4 cm in width, and the patient was admitted for bedside drainage.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7176**] is a 51-year-old male with past medical history significant for type I diabetes and mental retardation who was brought to ED from his group home after an episode of hypoglycemia with FSG of 37 and repeat FSG of 40 even after having his dinner. EMS was called and he was given [**1-25**] amp of dextrose enroute to [**Hospital1 18**]. Per caregivers, patient's mental status was at usual baseline. In the ED, initial vs were: T 98F, P 86, BP 104/63, RR 20, O2 saturation rate is 97% room air.

74-year-old gentleman with a several year history of asymptomatic, severe aortic stenosis which has been followed by serial echocardiograms. His echocardiograms have shown a progressively worsening valve area and gradients. He denies chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, PND, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. He is quite active working out with a personal trainer twice a week as well as walking and riding a bicycle without symptoms. There is a question as to whether the amount of exercise he is performing is adequate to "cause" symptoms. Therefore, he has been referred for surgery due to his most recent echo findings which suggest now critical aortic stenosis. He was admitted today for a diagnostic cardiac catheterization in preparation for an aortic valve replacement. Cardiac Catheterization: [**2864-11-28**]   [**Hospital1 18**] Coronary angiography:  right dominant LMCA:  No angiographically-apparent CAD.

Per the patient he had recently been having problems with his social situation.  He resides in house with his male partner and another roommate.  He reported that roommate is extremely disrespectful of his property in general and that this had led him to become progressively more angry and frustrated.  His frustration had become so great that on the day prior to presentation he returned to his parent's home.  He was agitated and seemed slightly paranoid to his parents but otherwise was acting his normal self.  Per his parents' report he went to bed approximately midnight.  The patient admitted taking a large amount of wellbutrin that night saying he wanted "it all to go away."  He will not firmly articulate whether he had any intention to end his life.  The following morning his father discovered him around 6:00 am hanging off the couch, picking at invisible objects in the air, and babbling to himself.

Head CT, UA, and CXR were WNL.  The patient received IV ceftriaxone 2 gm x 1, vancomycin 1 gm IV x 1 and went on to have LP (which was negative for a pleiocytosis). Toxicology was also consulted as the patient appeared flushed and warm but without fevers and they thought his presentation was most likely consistent with anticholinergic toxicity (though there was never any clear anticholinergic ingestion).  He received 4 mg IV lorazepam in the ED for agitation.  He was initially to go to medicine but on toxicology reevaluation he was unresponsive to sternal rub and then noted to desaturate to 85% on RA.  Non-rebreather placed with O2 sat 99% then down to 94-96%. He was intubated for airway protection with etomidate 20 mg IV x 1 and succinylcholine 130 mg IV x 1 and then transferred to the ICU.

The patient is a 60 year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, end stage renal disease on hemodialysis and hypertension who was found unresponsive on her floor on [**2975-12-11**].  The patient was last seen awake and talking the previous night.  The patient was intubated in the field and brought in at [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 2114**] [**Last Name (Titles) **].  Blood pressure on admission was 230 to 260/80 to 100, pulse 55 to 70.  On initial examination the patient was unresponsive to voice.  The patient was intubated.  The patient showed decerebrate posturing to sternal rub.  Face symmetric.  Pupils 2 mm fixed, positive OCR.  No blink.  Decreased tone throughout. Head CT revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage, large right basal ganglia bleed and extension into the ventricles with evidence of hydrocephalus and a 1 cm midline shift.  The patient the same day on [**2975-12-11**] underwent a right frontal intraventricular drain placement.  The patient continued to be monitored in an Intensive Care Unit setting. On [**2975-12-13**], the patient had evidence of brain stem compression with a left cranial nerve III palsy.  This was explained to the family.  On [**12-15**] on neurological examination the patient had no pupillary response to light. No OCR.  No corneals, no gag reflux with ETT movement.  No cold cholurics bilaterally, no withdraw to pain in any extremities.  No posturing or movement with sternal rub. Neurological no brain stem reflexes were elicited and given the lack of response, this is consistent with brain death. The patient was reexamined later that day and again fulfilled brain death criteria.  This was discussed with the family and the family made the decision to withdraw the patient off life support and off the ventilator.  The ventilator was shut off in the evening of [**12-15**] and the patient was declared dead at 8:22 p.m. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 1118**] Dictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3979**] MEDQUIST36 D:  [**2975-12-16**]  08:37 T:  [**2975-12-18**]  08:29 JOB#:  [**Job Number 8967**]

[**Age over 90 **] y.o. Female with h.o. A. fib w/ tachybrady syndrome, DM II, HL, CAD admitted to the ED from NSH w/ progressive SOB and low oxygenation status. . Per EMS report she was noted to have cyanotic fingertips. She was orientated to herself only. Per the family she has felt unwell for the past few days, however, due to her underlying dementia she has not been able to explain her symptoms. She has been noted to have . In the emergency department, initial vitals were: HR 70, BP 152/89, RR 22, Sat 89%. Labs were notable for a neutrophillic leukocytosis of 13.7, 87.8M, 6.7L. Electrolytes were notable for K of 5.3, BUN/Cr 32/2.0. Cardiac enzymes were negative, Lactate 8.8. Chest x-ray was notable for low lung volumes, possible RML consolidation, mildly blunted left costraphrenic angle secondary to pleural thickening vs small effusion, mild pulm vasc congestion. She was given Zosyn 4.5gm IV x 1, Vancoymcin 1gm IV x 1 for empirical coverage for possible PNA and sepsis. She also received 500cc NS Bolus x 1. For the elevated INR she received 10mg IV Vit K and 2u of FFP Per the ED a goals of care discussion was initiated between the family, ED resident/attending and PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] did not want any blood transfusions, central line placement, pressors, and family expressed status as DNR and DNI. After discussion with the PCP family wanted [**Name9 (PRE) 8972**] to be given to correct her INR. . Vitals prior to transfer were:  HR high 70s, A. fib, BP 104/88, sat 100% on NRB. . On the floor a family meeting was held regarding goals of care. After frank discussion with the family it was deemed that the pt would want to be comfortable and would want measures to make quality of life better as opposed to prolong life. It was decided during the meeting with both healthcare proxy'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**Doctor First Name 4076**] and grandson that the pt would be made comfort measures only. Comfort measures included initiation of morphine IV if the pt appeared uncomfortable due to pain or air hunger. To give FFP to reverse her INR, the only lab draws would be to check an INR. After the INR was reversed lab draws would be discontinued. Pt would be able to eat a regular diet, no IV fluid would be given in spite of her oliguria due to risk of pulmonary edema. She would be able to intake PO to address any thirst. No central lines, arterial lines would be placed. No vasopressors would be used. Given the pt's underlying dementia her healthcare proxy's were utilized for this decision.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 33 year old woman with a past medical history significant for asthma presents to the hospital complaining of SOB and chest tightness x 1 week.  She states that her symptoms began approximately 2 days after moving into her grandmother??????s attic.  She started to wake up in the middle of the night feeling SOB which was quickly relieved with her inhaler.  The day before presentation to the hospital, she not only had symptoms at night, she also started to experience SOB, chest tightness and wheezing throughout the day.  She used her inhaler approximately 10 times but experienced no relief, she then used her cousin??????s albuterol nebulizer because she was too weak to go through her un-packed moving boxes to find her own.  She gave herself 2 treatments with no relief of symptoms.  Her aunt, concerned about her lack of improvement called 911. At baseline, Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] uses her inhaler approximately twice per day and states that she normally does not have to use it at night.  She states that for the past 3-4 years she feels that her asthma has been under control.  She reports that she had to be intubated approximately 2-3 times and averages [**2-9**] emergency room visits a year.  Her triggers include:  cold, URIs, mental stress, cats, pollen, flowers, perfume and possibly exercise. In her new home she needs to go through a common hallway to get to her room. She has also been w/o her allergy pillows since the move. In the [**Name (NI) **] pt received IV Solumedrol and ATC albuterol nebs with improvement in her symptoms.

35 yo female with hx of asthma presenting from home in acute respiratory distress.  She was brought into the ED by EMS with reported 2 hours of severe SOB after increasing symptoms since morning with decreasing relief from MDI.  She denied any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, dirarrhea, abdominal pain or productive cough. En route to the ED, her vitals were 142/70 140 18 100% on 6L. She received albuterol neb x3, atrovent x1, and epi x 2. On arrival in the ED her vitals were 99.2  [**Telephone/Fax (3) 9027**]0  93% on ? O2. She was given Salumedrol 125 mg IV and magnesium 2gm. She appeared fatigued and tiring, and was then intubated using succinylcholine and etomidate.  A propfol drip was used for sedation. In speaking with her boyfriend, he reports that he saw her 3 hours prior to her ED visit, and she was using her neb at home and seemed slightly short of breath and wheezy although she was able to speak in sentences. He reports that she typically has to visit the ED/ hospital stay for asthma exacerbations every 2 months.  She has been intubated 4 times in the past, the last time being over 3 years ago.  She was recently prescribed a course of steroids on [**2625-2-11**] for 3 days of SOB. He also reports that she often times develops exacerbations with the severe cold.
This patient is currently unidentified female in her 60's who was found down in her driveway and unresponsive. Paramedics were called and pt reported to be GCS at the scene. She was taken to OSH where she was intubated and CT head was obtained. Initial reports from OSH were of a 11mm acute SDH with 9mm of midline shift. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent neurosurgery evaluation.
Ms [**Known patient lastname 9032**] is a 62 year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, falls leading to subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages with resultant L partial motor seizure who now presents with headache, agitation, and transfer from an outside hospital for another SAH / IPH hemorrhage.  Per reports she was complaining of headache this morning.  Nursing came in at the rehab center and noticed her to be very confused, somnolent and noncooperative.  There was a man who the family has not met and is a reported boyfriend of the patient in the room.  Nursing was concerned he had given her some [**Known patient lastname 4915**].  She was taken to an OSH where she was given narcan without response and a NCHCT demonstrated a new IPH.  She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.   Of note her CXR demonstrated some vascular peritracheal prominence and UA demonstrated a new UTI. Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9034**] initial trouble began [**3101-7-7**] when she fell down some stairs leading to a basilar skull fracture and R subdural hematoma.  She underwent a craniotomy  for evacuation of the hemorrhage and R temporal lobectomy.  On POD #5 she developed L arm and face twitching lasting 5-10 minutes.  She had been on prophylactic Dilantin and initially Keppra was added to her regimen for seizure control.  Because of side effects, this was changed to Dilantin and Depakote.  After a prolonged hospitalization and rehabilation, she was eventually discharged to home on [**3102-2-21**] where she was living independently for several weeks with daily assistance from her daughter who lives nearby. She was admitted to the neurosurgery service [**Date range (1) 9035**] after she had another fall from standing.  She was found to have a new right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage and was observed and evaluated for possible syncope.  Her dilantin level was toxic at 23.9 and this medication was then discontinued.  It is unclear from the records if she was supposed to restart at discharge or continuing holding the dilantin. There was no mention of gait unsteadiness in the documentation, but dilantin toxicity may have been contributing to her falls at that time. in Mid [**Month (only) 541**] while at rehab noticed that her left arm, face and leg were shaking.  This persisted during the ambulance ride to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1441**] Hospital and was not stopped until 1mg of ativan was administered somewhere around 30minutes after symptoms began.  Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] was admitted to the epilepsy service after she had a breakthrough seizure at her rehab facility.  It was discovered that her dilantin had been discontinued prior to her recent discharge from the neurosurgery service and on admission her dilantin level was subtherapeutic at 7.2 and her depakote was also subtherapeutic at 28.  She was found to have a urinary tract infection.  Her seizure was likely a result both the infection and her low dilantin level. Because of her recent falls, it was decided that dilantin might be contributing to her instability, so this medication was not restarted.  She was instead loaded with IV keppra and then started on oral maintenance keppra.  She was given an extra dose of depakote during the hospital and the level at discharge was therapeutic at 57.  She had no further seizures during the hospitalization and an routine EEG showed no epileptiform events.  Her UTI was treated with ceftriaxone.  She initially has some significant confusion thought to be post-ictal but this improved over the several days following her seizure.  She was evaluated by PT and OT who recommended rehab for further treatment of her gait and balance difficulties.  At discharge, her neurological exam was remarkable for some tangential thinking and mild gait instability requiring a walker. Per cousin she was admitted to [**Hospital6 **] over the [**Hospital1 **] day holiday to the psychiatric facility for attacking a nurse.   It is unclear how they adjusted her meds. However, on review of her current meds she seems to be off of keppra and on scheduled Chlorpromazine. Patient was too uncooperative, and refused to answer any questions.  However, on speaking with her cousins they deny recent fever or chills.  No night sweats.  She has had recent weight loss and refusal to eat.  Denies cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.  She also has been refusing to void recently.  No dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

88RHF Russian-speaking with a past history of HTN, HLD, vertigo treated with meclizine presented with collapse and unresponsiveness and then proceeded to have a seizure and intubated in the ED for airway protection. Prior to presentation, patient had been feeling unwell for the past 2 days with significant vertigo (which is a chronic issues for her) with nausea and vomiting and treated with meclizine. She last vomited [**3285-2-10**]. Patient was otherwise more tired and fatigued. Patient was last seen well at 10pm on [**3285-2-10**] and went to bed. She had been staying overnight at her daughter's house. However at 22:30, her daughter heard a bang and found her on the floor completely unresponsive and not moving. EMS were called and in the ambulance had a GTC seizure with eye deviation to the rightand was given 2mg IV lorazepam. On arrival to the ED, she was intubated for airway protection. This was not traumatic. On insertion of an OG tube, there was drainage of dark red blood. She had no episodes of hematemesis prior to this per her daughter. CT showed right temporal and occipito-parietal hypodensities in keeping with a right PCA distribution. She was markedly hypertensive to 220s/120 and was given IV labetalol 20mg which transiently lowered her BP to 120s systolic and on stopping propofol this came back into the 160s range. She was then taken to CTA whch showed a left ICA T occlusion (and a right MCA occlusion in retrospect). Given the presence of an UGI bleed it was felt that thrombolysis would be contraindicated and hence a dscussion was g=held with the family by the stroke fellow Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7791**] and latterly by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], attending physician regarding possible [**Name9 (PRE) 7792**]. The family agreed and the patent went on to have the left ICA opened up which was patent other than an area in the left ACA as the A2 segment was still occluded. The right MCA had a distal clot and was not intervened upon. The patient was transferred to the ICU. Patient was intubated and sedated and would withdraw right>left legs and have extensor posturing of the arms at times with some withdrawal ainly on the right. Continued to drain dark red blood from her OG tube but remained hemodynamically stable.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 67 year old woman with a history of prior CVA's. She has left sided hemiparesis at baseline and speaks only a few words. She lives at a nursing facility. Her daughter visited her on her birthday ([**5-21**]). She reports that the patient was less responsive and kept her mouth open during the whole visit. It is unclear if she improved back to her baseline. This AM she was reportedly less responsive than normal per the staff at the nursing facility. She was also diaphoretic. An ambulance was called and she was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Her blood glucose en route was 117. . In the ED, initial vital signs were 84/60 116 99% on room air. She spiked a temp to 102 while in the ED. Labs were significant for sodium of 173, creatinine of 2.7, troponin of 0.14, and lactate of 1.3 (after fluid). Urinalysis showed large leuk esterase. She received 4.5 L of normal saline. Her chest xray was clear. There was no evidence of new stroke on CT. Her BP's continued to drop in the ED. A central line was placed and she was started on levophed. . On arrival to the MICU, patient did not respond to questions or movement.
This is a 80 yo F CAD s/p CABG, known CHF with EF of 20% presenting with 7 days shortness of breath and weight gain. Patient has had gradual worsening of these symptoms over the week PTA. At baseline she is able to walk the 3 blocks to her church. On day of admission she was unable to walk 5 feet without being short of breath. She weighs herself daily. Her baseline weight is 133lbs and she was at 141 on the day of admission. She has noticed some symmetric mild swelling of her legs similar to other episodes of decompensated CHF. She reports orthopnea. She reports a non-productive cough and sore throat for the last 2 days. She also complained of a few episodes of her typical anginal pain (left back/shoulder pain) that resolved with sublingual nitro and tylenol. . Of note she had a somewhat recent medication ([**4-30**]) change from bumex (thought to have caused a rash which resolved with steroid treatment) and was changed onto her old regimen of lasix (160 QAM, 80QPM-although at her last cardiology appt here she was stable at 160QAM, 160QPM). . She went to see her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**3247-7-16**], who found her to be hypoxic to 88% and then sent her to the ED. In the ED CXR showed CHF, BNP was elevated from 4000 to [**Numeric Identifier 7892**], PE/dissection were ruled out.  In addition, she was given 80mg IV lasix, and only put out 350cc (UO) over 8 hours at the ED.  She was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1498**] service overnight for further management.
Elective admission for stent assisted coiling of the R ICA aneurysm
The patient has a history of coronary artery disease who presented complaining of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Prior to admission, the patient noted right lower quadrant pain.  She then developed nausea and had several episodes of vomiting which began on the afternoon of admission.  She then went to the bathroom and noted bright red urine.  Her family then brought her to the Emergency Department. She arrived at the Emergency Department at approximately 3 a.m.  At this point, she complained of bilateral lower abdominal pain which radiated into her back.  She vomited bilious fluid in the Emergency Department times one.  At the time, she denied any chest pain.  She denied any shortness of breath, fevers, or chills. She was sent for an abdominal computed tomography which showed a 5-cm X 4-cm abscess within the portal system of the liver as well as trabeculation and wall thickening in the bladder consistent with cystitis. While in the process of being evaluated, the patient developed progressive shortness of breath and an oxygen desaturation down to the 80%.  She was emergently intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress. Subsequent to intubation, the patient developed hemoptysis with profuse blood coming from the endotracheal tube, requiring extensive suctioning.  She was sent for an emergent chest computed tomography which revealed marked pulmonary parenchymal consolidation consistent with a pulmonary hemorrhage. Multiple attempts to obtain blood for laboratory analysis were attempted; however, all samples drawn were severely hemolyzed and unable to be processed by the laboratory. Laboratories were again attempted but continued to be markedly hemolyzed.  An arterial blood gas was obtained which showed her hematocrit to be 15 with a pH initially of 7.19 which had dropped to 6.87.  Further laboratories were unable to be obtained at this time given her hemolysis. Given her clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, there was concern that the patient was in massive disseminated intravascular coagulation.  An emergent Hematology consultation was obtained.  In addition, an emergent Surgery Service consultation was obtained to evaluate for hepatic abscess for possible surgical intervention. Transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit was arranged for further treatment.
47yo M with extensive past medical history, including HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B & C, Cirrhosis, Seizures, and Schizophrenia, presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED from NH with mental status changes. FBS was 50 during ambulance transport, he was given 1 amp of dextrose and arrived to ED lethargic, with red RLE and FBS in the 170s. In the ED, US (-) for DVT, CTOH (-) for hemorrhage, CT abdomen / pelivs revealed: markedly distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis and significant intra- and extrahepatic biliary dilatation, likely related to choledocholithiasis and CBD obstruction. No CT evidence of gallbladder wall thickening or perforation, though free fluid was noted. No associated pancreatic ductal dilatation. Probable hepatic cirrhosis and portal hypertension with varices and mild splenomegaly. As a result of these findings, he underwent an ERCP with stent placement and stone removal at the lower third of the common bile duct, and was transferred to the SICU upon completion of the procedure.

He has had no recent sick contacts or travel.  He had been constipated for 5 days prior to admission and his wife also feels that he had decreased UOP over the same time period. He received the flu shot ~1 month ago.  Per his wife's report, he has had 2 hospital admissions in the last 2 years for similar complaints of SOB in the setting EtOH binges although this has been the most severe. . Upon admission to OSH, he was complaining of SOB.  His initial ABG was 7.38/24/106. He had a CXR performed which reportedly showed an enlarged heart and pulmonary edema.  His BNP was 530. His creatinine on presentation was 1.9. He was admitted for possible CHF exacerbation and ? ACS. He was intially treated w/ NTG gtt. Cardiac enzymes were negative x 2. He was diuresed and put out ~2L.  He creatinine subsequently rose to 2.4.  He was also started on Toprol XL and lisinopril for presumed CHF.  He reportedly had increasing respiratory distress and was transferred to the MICU.  In the MICU he was briefly on BiPAP but was quickly weaned to 5LNC w/ O2 sats in [**Doctor Last Name **] low 90s.  His BPs on the floor were SBPs in 90s-110s but in the ICU his SBPs were 70s to 90s.  He was not started on any pressors. He had a PA catheter placed which showed a PCWP of 10.  However, he had 2 ECHOs performed which reportedly showed normal systolic function. He was diuresed and his renal function continued to worsen w/ a peak BUN of 77 and creatinine of 3.3. He was started on moxifloxacin on [**11-24**] for potential pulmonary infection in setting of productive cough and leukocytosis. Nephrology was consulted regarding his worsening renal failure.  By report, the nephrologist did not see any RBC casts or other casts on mico analysis.  He felt that his ARF was likely prerenal.  Patient then received some IVF with increase in his UOP. Prior to transfer he became increasingly disoriented and received a dose of ativan for ? withdrawal. He also had blood cultures drawn and received a dose of vancomycin for unclear reasons.
This 76 year old Russian speaking male presented to the ER after awakening from sleep with chest pain. He ruled out for an infarction. Catheterization showed severe left main and triple vessel disease and Cardiac Surgery was consulted for surgical revascularization.

This is a 33 year old Brazilian man who was painting his house at 05:00 p.m. on [**8-21**]. At around 09:00 p.m. he developed right facial droop, slurred speech and altered mental status.  He was taken to an outside hospital by EMS where a CT scan showed a 2 centimeter by 4 centimeter by 3 centimeter bleed in the right basal ganglion. He was then transferred to the Neurosurgery Service at [**Hospital1 69**].  He was started on Nipride and Decadron.  Medicine was consulted regarding the question of malignant hypertension.  They declined the secondary hypertension work-up because they felt that normal renal function along with long-standing hypertension was less likely.  The patient did have a diagnosis of essential hypertension but was not taking his medications, possibly Hydrochlorothiazide, for one to two years. An angiogram was done which was negative for malformation. It was thought that the patient had this bleed due to his history of essential hypertension. The patient also had a fever and increased white blood cell count that was noticed after he was intubated.  His sputum was positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus and he was started on Levaquin.  He was extubated on [**8-26**] and did well. He was weaned off Nitroprusside and that was stopped on [**8-27**], and he was then started on Lopressor 100 mg p.o. q. six, Enalapril 20 mg q. day and Clonidine patch for blood pressure control.  He was transferred to the Neurology Service at this time. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On mental status, he was alert, oriented to person and place, not date or year.  There was some language barrier due to his speaking mainly Portugese. His speech was dysarthric.  He can repeat but difficult to assess secondary to language.  No apraxia.  He is able to follow commands appropriately.  Difficult to understand at times.  Cranial nerves were right facial droop, extraocular movements intact.  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  There was right sided tongue deviation.  Sensation was normal.  Shrug was normal.  Strength was five out of five on the left; on the right deltoids are three plus; biceps were four minus, triceps were three plus, wrist flexors were three plus, wrist extensors four minus.  Finger flexors were three plus, finger extensors four minus.  Interosseous four minus, hip flexors four plus.  Hip extensors five.  Knee flexors five minus, knee extensors five.  Toe extensors five, toe flexors five.  Sensory was intact to light touch for both temperature and proprioception.  Deep tendon reflex were two out of four plus bilateral upper extremities and lower extremities.  Right patella was three out of four plus, and left was two out of four. Gait was not assessed.  The patient refused to walk.  Coordination was normal, finger-to-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements on the left as well.  There was slight ataxia on the right likely secondary to weakness.  There was slow repetitive knee movements. HOSPITAL COURSE:   On admission to the Neurology Service, the patient was doing well and continued to do well with Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy and Speech.  It was deemed that the patient should continue these three modalities of rehabilitation on discharge. In regards to his blood pressure he was on the medicines as stated above.  On the day prior to discharge, his pressures were extremely well controlled.  His pressures ranged from 100 to 130 systolic over 68 to 80 diastolic.  Multiple doses of his Lopressor were held in the two days prior to discharge for a total of four doses held over two days, secondary to the low blood pressure parameters.  His other vital signs were stable and the patient and his wife were excited to go home. He was sent home on [**8-30**], and was doing well neurologically.  We decreased his Metoprolol to 100 mg twice a day as his blood pressure was well controlled and continued the rest of his medicines as stated below. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: 1.  He is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the Neurology Clinic in four weeks. 2.

This is a 71 year old female with a history of COPD requiring home oxygen.  EMS were called this morning due to her increased dyspnea.  The patient has been complaining of increasing dyspnea, cough with productive sputum for the last three days with increased frequency of home 02 use.  The patient was started on Levofloxacin on [**2742-1-15**] by her primary care physician without improvement in her symptoms.  Also complaining of mild intermittent fevers and chills without nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain.  She did have decreased po intake per daughter who lives with her.  No change in status when she went to bed last night.  This morning the patient awoke and was markedly worse.  At that time EMS was called and they found the patient to be tachycardic at 122 with a blood pressure of 140/40 with an oxygen saturation of 85% on four liters nasal cannula which improved to 100% on 100% nonrebreather. On arrival in the Emergency Room, the patient's blood pressure was elevated.  She was tachycardic and mildly tachypneic with an oxygen saturation of 79% on room air and 99% on 100% nonrebreather.  She was diffusely wheezy on auscultation.  She was given back to back nebulizer treatments, briefly placed on BiPAP with no improvement in her clinical status.  Thus she was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  She received 1 gram of Ceftriaxone and 125 mg of Solu-Medrol.  She also received intermittent IV boluses of normal saline for blood pressure support.
Mr [**Known patient lastname **] is a 70 y.o. male with a lingular mass found incidentally on a chest xray done prior to an ENT procedure. He underwent EBUS and pathology from EBUS demonstrated poorly differentiated carcinoma with negative nodes. Pathology showed that the tumor displayed a small component of non-small-cell lung cancer as well as dominant component of neuroendocrine carcinoma with some features suggestive of small cell carcinoma. Per imaging, there is no distal disease. He underwent pulmonary function testing which demosntated that he is a favorable candidate for a lobectomy. He therefore presented for a LEFT upper lobectomy.

This is a 41 y.o. female with history of HIV (Last CD4 count 160 per ED records, viral load > 100,000 in [**3421**] per OMR), history of IVDU, s/p tricuspid endocardititis with bioprosthetic valve replacement who presents for evaluation of fevers, malaise and 2 days of chest pain, and cough productive of brown sputum. Patient is poor historian, answers questions but not completely and requires frequent redirection.  Per ED records, she complains of intermittent chest discomfort, productive cough with brown sputum, fevers, reportedly to 104 at home. There was no history of recent IVDU per patient.  ED record does report histor of possible recent inhaled crack cocain use.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8104**] is a 59 yo man with h/o HTN who is transferred here from an OSH for + stress test.  He noted L arm pain while walking on the treadmill and went to his PCP last week, who suggested stress testing. The patinet then noted palpitations starting on Thursday as well as chest pressure while in the shower since the weekend. He denies pain but distinctly felt chest pressure that did not radiate elsewhere, no N/V, no diaphoresis.  He notes that this past weekend he felt "flu-like" with a low grade fever, cough, and general malaise although no sputum, shortness of breath or nasal drip.  He went to an OSH today after the increased CP and palpitations scared him, and he was found to have a positive stress test.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catherization.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 67 year old male with known CAD, s/p anterior MI in [**2995**] who presents with chest pain. Early this year patient developed progressive decrease in his exercise tolerance, with shortness of breath and chest tightness occuring with exertion and resolving with rest. He was evaluated with a cardiac catheterization that demonstrated 3vd and 90% occlusion of 1st diagonal, reduced to 50% with POBA. Subsequently planned to undergo CABG in [**3011-2-1**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Following that procedure his symptoms improved and chest pain had nearly resolved. Then in late [**3010-10-2**] (~2 months ago) chest pain returned and unlike previously it started occuring at rest, and required longer rest periods to alleviate his discomfort. This has continued a few times a day for the past 2 months. The day of admission he was eating an afternoon meal and not exerting himself patient had the acute onset of chest pain. The key difference this time was that it was more intense, lasted longer, and returned ~10 minutes after it subsided. Describes it as his typical substernal chest tightness that radiated down both arms. At the onset of symptoms patient took ASA 162mg, lopressor and when pain did not resolve he took 2sl nitro. Following the second SL nitro pain resolved but then returned ~10 minutes later. He knew he could only take 1 more nitro so he presented to an OSH for evaluation as this was first time he had required nitro for chest pain in some time. At OSH, ECG showed poor R wave progression, but no other acute changes. CE's negative. He was given lovenox and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
This is an 85-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, myocardial infarction in [**3155**], chronic renal insufficiency, anemia, who presents after falling in the bathroom earlier on the day of admission.  The patient felt clammy, and was unresponsive for 20 to 30 minutes.  The patient had a sensation of shortness of breath and lightheadedness around the time of the event.  No post-ictal state was noted.  The patient has no history of seizures. The patient was found to have a urinary tract infection, consistent with his symptoms of dysuria and increased frequency of urination.  In the Emergency Department, the patient was found to be febrile, with decreased oxygen saturation, and tachycardic with ST depression, mostly rate-related, and most obvious in Leads V4 through V6. The patient has had a similar experience in [**3155**].  At that time, he had a pseudomonas/enterococcus urosepsis, that presumably led to demand ischemia and subsequent myocardial infarction.  His last echocardiogram in [**3155**] showed an ejection fraction of 35%. In the Emergency Department, the patient was started on ceftazidime for pseudomonal coverage, based on his past episode of urosepsis.  The patient was also started on intravenous normal saline, and his blood pressures hovered at around 100 systolic.  The patient was also given one unit of packed red blood cells for demand-related ischemia.  About two hours into the patient's transfusion, he had an episode of tachycardia to 120, an increased respiratory rate up to 40, with a temperature of 100.6.  He was found to be very wheezy and also had distinct rigors.  At this point, the patient was given 80 mg of intravenous lasix, was put on non-rebreather, and also given Solu-Medrol, Demerol, and albuterol.  The patient was stable, and his oxygen saturation went up.  His chest x-ray showed no evidence of any flash pulmonary edema.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8113**] is a 66 yo Aramaic-speaking man with history of vascular dementia, gastric carcinoid tumor, hypertension, and ptsd who presents from [**Hospital1 1483**] today with fever and hematochezia. History is limited due to patient's mental status. Per EMS documentation, patient was found to have a fever to 100.4 this morning on routine vital signs. He was given tylenol and fever remained at 100.4 when rechecked at 100.4. At 0815, patient had small loose stool with small amount of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ambulance was called. On EMS arrival, VS were 170/84, 82, 18, 96% RA. . In the ED, patient appeared well. On exam he was guaiac positive with dark stool. He was oriented x2 and had mild periumbilical abdominal pain. NGL was performed and was reportedly "rose tinged" with immediate clearance after 250 cc of saline. Received 40 mg IV protnix. CT abdomen showed cholethiasis. CXR showed diffuse interstitial opacities, so patient received levaquin 750 mg IVx1. UA negative. Hct 35 at baseline. Cr at 1.3 from normal baseline. EKG Two peripherals for Access. GI was aware and examined the patient in the ER with no plan for urgent egd. On transfer, VS were 99.5, 107, 177/75, 98% RA. . In the MICU, patient denies fevers, chills, cough, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, headache, neck pain, chest pain, palpitations and dyspnea. He reports mild LLQ and periumbilical pain. Patient was monitored into the ICU and then sent to general floors for further management.
This is a 69-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, disease who is status post a large anterior myocardial infarction, status post cardiac catheterization, who is being admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for observation and management. The patient was in his usual state of health until he stopped his aspirin for approximately one week in order to receive a the sudden onset of substernal chest pain at 12:45.  It was rated a [**9-8**], and it radiated to his left arm.  It was associated with shortness of breath.  There was no nausea or vomiting.  The patient immediately presented to the Emergency Department at the [**State 1540**].  An electrocardiogram done in the Emergency Room showed marked ST elevations in the precordial leads, in I, and [**State **] with corresponding ST depressions inferiorly.  He was given aspirin, sublingual nitroglycerin, Lopressor intravenously, and he was placed on a nitroglycerin drip.  He was started on tenecteplase and transferred to [**Hospital1 186**] for cardiac catheterization. Immediate catheterization upon arrival to [**Hospital1 341**] revealed a 60% left anterior descending artery lesion which received successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.  No left ventriculogram was performed.  There were no arrhythmias, and hypotension was not seen.  Pressures on entering were pulmonary artery pressures of 51/20, with a wedge pressure of 22, cardiac output of 6.45, and a cardiac index of 3.15. Post catheterization, he was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further care.  Upon arrival at the Coronary Care Unit, his blood pressure and heart rate were normal, and the patient denied any chest pain.

47-year-old right-handed female with a past history of essential thrombocytosis JAK-2 positive currently on hydroxyurea, migraines, s/p parathyroidectomy for parathyroid adenoma, anxiety, cervical stenosis presents as a transfer from OSH with severe headaches and hypertensive urgency. Patiennt has a history of migraines followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and her currrent hedaches are not like this. She had been recently changed from topiramate to nortriptyline with a resultant worsening of her headaches initially to 2x/month (from having no headaches in 6 months) and then later daily headaches which were different by their faster onset, particularly after lunch each day for the past 2 weeks. She had been taking very frequent Tylenol and latterly hydrocodone/acetaminophen for this which was of some benefit. She contact[**Name (NI) **] neurology on 2 occasions in the past week regarding her headaches and was advised of the risk of analgesic overuse headache with such frequent doses. Her normal migraines are more classic with throbbing/stabbing unilateral headaches without nausea and vomiting but with an aura with fortification spectra (wiggly lines)in addition to photo/phonophobia. She noted that for the past 6 days, her headaches have been more severe. There was no evidence of recurrent thunderclap hedaches although there were times when her hedache was less severe. Her headache was diffuse and very severe, throbbing in nature and markedly different from her migraines. This was associated with nausea and latterly profuse vomiting such that she was unable to keep anything down in addition to some mild photophobia, sweating and flushing episodes. She denied visual symptoms. She has had 2 ED presentations as a result of her headaches prior to her OSH admission on [**10-9**]. On [**10-5**] she was treated symptomatically and sent [**Last Name (un) **] after CT head was normal. On [**10-6**], she had an LP on [**10-6**] which was unremarkable but no opening pressure was measured 4 RBCs <1 WBC Glc 62 Pr 19. Head CT showed some right maxillary sinusitis and she was given azithromycin and again sent home. Per patient report, on these occasions she was also significantly hypertensive with SBP 180s. Her percocet helped regarding her headache. She was finally admitted on [**10-9**] after she had been profusely vomiting for 2-3 days and at that time was found to have significant hypertensive urgency in association with her headaches with BP 229/121. Her neurological examination was unremarkable and she was admitted to the ICU at [**Hospital3 1425**] Hospital and started on an IV nicardipine infusion which controlled her SBP to 160s. She had no prior history of hypertension. On admission given metoclopramide, ondansetrona nd compazine for nausea. They treated her with s/c and IV dilaudid for pain. K was noted to be 3.0 on admission and sh was treated with 40mEq KCl. She was seen by cardiology who were concerned for venous sinus thrombosis given her ET who nephrology who recommended work-up for secondary causes for HTN (wshe had completed 600ml of her urine metanephrines). She was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for MRV as [**Hospital3 1425**] did not have this facility and she had an allergy to CT contrast agents. They had stopped her nortriptylien given concern for this contributing to her sx. Vitals on transfer 98F 86 16 153/64 100% 2L O2. Patient had IV dilaudid and IV compazine en route. She currently has headache which was [**6-15**] and relieved to [**5-16**] post IV morphine.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname 798**] is an 81-year-old woman with a history of hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, nonallergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, and chronic cough who presents with cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath.  Per the patient, she developed an increasing cough over the last week associated with wheezy.  She was seen in [**Company 189**] on [**4-17**] and was sent to the ED for evaluation due to the concern of hypoxia to 94% and possible ischemia based on an EKG.  She was admitted overnight (discharge summary not complete) and treated for asthma exacerbation (although no clear history of this) with nebs and steroids, and advair was added back to her regimen.  She went home on [**4-18**] and started to wheeze again.  Her granddaughter called Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**4-19**] because they thought she was supposed to be on a steroid taper, but was not discharged on steroids.
